      "|30 September 2024|30 |September|2024|676728b19f52b39d781630ca|Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) utilizes multiple distributed access points (APs) to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE). However, challenging propagation environments can degrade communication performance due to substantial penetration loss. Integrating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into CF mMIMO can mitigate these issues by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the incident signals and adjusting the coefficients of its elements, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint precoding design of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems to maximize the sum SE. This involves refining the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. We introduce a fully distributed heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm that incorporates trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Unlike conventional multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on centralized training and execution, our HATRPO algorithm uses only local channel state information, reducing the need for high backhaul capacity by 13%. Simulation results demonstrate that our HATRPO algorithm significantly improves the sum SE in various scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |[Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Enyu Shi, Ziheng Liu, Chau Yuen, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai]                                                                           |[{Yiyang Zhu, P.

      "|27 November 2024 |27 |November |2024|676728b19f52b39d781631be|Detecting leaks in natural gas pipelines using acoustic signals typically requires extensive prior knowledge and complex parameter designs, making it challenging to handle background noise and data distribution disparities simultaneously. This article proposes a dual-feature drift framework utilizing a nonparametric design approach for acoustic signal-based leak detection. This framework consists of two core technologies: first, feature backward normalization. Low-dimensional drift factors are designed based on transformed acoustic signals to exponentially normalize the time-periodic features of the signal feature matrix, thereby eliminating strong background noise. Second, constructing the feature drift layer within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Weighted parameters constrain a high-dimensional feature matrix, developing drift factors that perform exponential drift on each feature, thus enhancing gradient constraints and eliminating data distribution differences during model training. This framework achieves a fault identification accuracy of 95.46% for natural gas pipeline leaks, outperforming competing methods and representing a novel approach to intelligent pipeline leak detection.

      "|14 February 2024 |14 |February |2024|676728b19f52b39d7816300a|Accurately predicting nearby agents' future trajectories is fundamental for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. However, existing learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes, potentially leading to failed predictions in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce IMGTP, a unified framework for systematically evaluating, improving, and measuring the generalization performance of trajectory prediction models in OOD scenes. IMGTP consists of three primary components: the Argoverse-Shift dataset, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy, and an approach for OOD measurement. First, the Argoverse-Shift is a cross-domain dataset that highlights the significant differences in data distributions across domains, serving as a testing platform for models' generalization ability. Second, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy leverages map centerlines and the FrenÃÂ©t Frame to enhance the generalizability of baseline models by mitigating the domain gap resulting from road geometry variations. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology for OOD measurement, quantifying the range of data that can be effectively handled by prediction models. This measurement approach employs the accuracy rate of the correctly predicted samples and their corresponding mean distance as well as standard deviation to the training set center as indicators of the model's generalization ability. The mean distance also serves as a valid criterion for OOD detection and uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that our IMGTP framework enhances the generalization capability of mainstream trajectory prediction models by substantially improving their prediction performance in unseen domains.

However, even high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) based electricity price forecasting (EPF) models have instances when their prediction error is much higher than those shown by mean performance metrics. To date, explainable AI has been used to enhance the model transparency and trustworthiness of AI-based EPF models. However, this paper demonstrates that insights from explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be expanded beyond its primary task of explanatory visualizations. This work presents a XAI-based error compensation approach to improve model performance and identify irregular predictions. The first phase of the proposed approach involves error quantification through a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) based corrector model that fine-tunes the base predictorâs forecasts. Using this corrector modelâs SHAP explanations, the proposed approach distinguishes high-accuracy pre...

Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information, which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control (CIDC) framework for formation control in diverse scenarios. This framework splits the driving task into three modules: static trajectory planning, order allocation, and dynamic optimal tracking. First, in the static trajectory planning module, static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories, freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency. Second, in the order allocation module, reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected, determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time. Finally, in the dynamic optimal tracking module, a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles, thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations. Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment, making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving, deliver and platoon driving

However, they face a global crisis characterized by significant population decline, including colony collapse disorder, which threatens their survival. Therefore, the development of precision beekeeping IoT systems is pivotal for enhancing bee colony strength. This study analyzes and categorizes the research focusing on the colony strength into two main areas based on colony activity and threat detection. Research on colony activity aids beekeepers to effectively manage their hives by analyzing behaviors, such as internal status, swarming, and traffic. In threat detection, research focuses on identifying critical predators, such as hornets and varroa destructor that significantly affect colony survival. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review, thoroughly presenting findings on the evolution and diversification of methodologies aimed at enhancing colony strength.

      "|25 September 2024|25 |September|2024|676728b19f52b39d781631ed|Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world. Technologies such as the medical Internet of Things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely:\\nâ\\n1\\n(Policy and Compliance Management),\\nâ\\n2\\n(Employee Training and Awareness),\\nâ\\n3\\n(Data Protection and Privacy Control),\\nâ\\n4\\n(Monitoring and Response), and\\nâ\\n5\\n(Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that\\nâ\\n3\\nactivities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by\\nâ\\n1\\nand\\nâ\\n2\\nactivities. Finally,\\nâ\\n4\\nand\\nâ\\n5\\nshould be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.

Observations from different sources on an object can conflict with each other due to errors, missing records, typos, outdated data, etc. How to discover truth facts for objects from various sources is essential and urgent. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive and exhaustive survey on truth discovery problems from the perspectives of concepts, methods, applications, and opportunities. We first systematically review and compare problems from objects, sources, and observations. Based on these problem properties, different methods are analyzed and compared in depth from observation with single or multiple values, independent or dependent sources, static or dynamic sources, and supervised or unsupervised learning, followed by the surveyed applications in various scenarios. For future studies in truth discovery fields, we summarize the code sources and datasets used in above methods. Finally, we point out the potential challenges and opportunities on truth discovery, with the goal of shedding light and promoting further investigation in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |[Shuang Wang, He Zhang, Quan Z.

This article draws parallels with the cloud revolution, highlighting the need for deeper integrations of AI expertise within engineering teams. We discuss the evolution of product engineering during the cloud era, emphasizing the transition from specialized functional teams to a more integrated model leveraging cloud-native capabilities. We then delve into the challenges and opportunities presented by AI-integrated products, advocating for a distributed model of AI expertise where AI skills are embedded within existing teams. We outline the benefits of this approach, such as accelerated development, deeper AI understanding, and a culture of continuous learning. Finally, we address the challenges of talent gaps, cultural resistance, and integration complexity, offering strategies for mitigation. By embracing a proactive and strategic approach, engineering organizations can successfully navigate the AI revolution and reap its full benefits.

However, this advancement brings forth challenges in data ownership, as emphasized by the General Data Protection Regulationâs right to be forgotten. The right to be forgotten allows participants to erase their data contributions from well-trained AIGC models. Training AIGC models demands an extensive amount of data and computations, often surpassing the capabilities of individual participants. As a solution, Federated Learning (FL) is employed to collaboratively train an AIGC model without sharing raw data directly. To protect the right to be forgotten in FL, âfederated unlearningâ has been introduced to eradicate the data contributions of unlearning participants from fully trained AIGC models, achieved by deleting historical model updates. However, given that historical updates are distributed among various participants, they may still hold contributions from the unlearning participants. This presents a challenge to the trustworthiness of federated unlearning. In this paper, we first provide an overview of both centralized and federated learning and unlearning methods. We survey relevant works and classify four main categories for federated unlearning. Subsequently, we introduce a comprehensive decentralized unlearning architecture designed for trustworthy AIGC services. To address the challenge of participants retaining historical contributions from unlearning participants, we integrate a coded computing-based interaction mechanism, ensuring both scalability and security. We further present a case study using NanoGPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for decentralized unlearning. We conclude by identifying potential future research directions.

This paper proposes a novel biosensing concept by combining the Long-Range surface plasmon resonance (LRSPR) phenomenon and the tunneling effect induced by Frustrated total-internal reflection (FTIR). Multilayer sensing structures with energy transfer effects excited by LRSPR were designed. For the first time, a structure with two metal layers sandwiched between three dielectric matching layer(DML) film layers is proposed. The bilayer of the lithium fluoride (LiF)-Au-titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) film layer structure can enhance the surface electric field of the sensor, which makes the sensor structure have high sensitivity and FOM. The sensitivity of the sensor is 4869 nm/RIU under external conditions with a refractive index(RI) of 1.33223-1.37223 RIU, which is 1.2 times higher than the conventional surface plasmon resonance (CSPR) sensors, and the FOM can reach 41.26 RIU -1 , which is 1.72 times higher than the CSPR sensors. In addition, the TiO2 and LiF in this sensor are less prone to collapse, and the stability test results show that the relative standard deviation (RSD) is 0.4091%, which demonstrates good reliability and stability. The LRSPR sensor has the high sensitivity and FOM, and long detection distance, which makes it practical in the field of biochemical sensing.

However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment. Note to Practitioners âDiagnosing MCI allows for timely intervention and treatment measures to potentially slow down or even halt further cognitive decline.

One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters, like dopamine and nor-epinephrine, in cortical circuits. In terms of symbolic processing, these neuromodulators add âsalienceâ to various emotions and experiences. A salience-based neural network (SANN) architecture was proposed in [1]. We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications. In the context of underwater, surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos. Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes. However, while applying the same for underwater environments, it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details that are important for definin...

We showcase his pioneering breakthroughs in minimax optimization, p th norm formulations, yield optimization, and nonlinear circuit design optimization. We highlight advances in direct electromagnetic (EM) microwave optimization, circuit response sensitivities, and efficient S -parameters sensitivity calculations. We explore the port-tuning version of space mapping (SM) for EM-based analysis, techniques for industrial microwave design of satellite systems, and post-manufacture hardware tuning. The integration of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with SM for enhanced EM-based design optimization and yield prediction, cognition-driven microwave filter design, and parallels between SM and artificial intelligence (AI) is examined. Finally, we speculate on the future integration of cognitive science with engineering design, leveraging the synergy of AI, machine learning (ML), and SM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |[JosÃ© E.

Some self-supervised frameworks, such as deep image prior (DIP), have emerged, eliminating the explicit training procedure but often struggling to remove noise and artifacts under significant degradation. This work introduces a novel self-supervised accelerated parallel MRI approach called PEARL, leveraging a multiple-stream joint deep decoder with two cross-fusion schemes to accurately reconstruct one or more target images from compressively sampled k-space. Each stream comprises cascaded cross-fusion sub-block networks (SBNs) that sequentially perform combined upsampling, 2D convolution, joint attention, ReLU activation and batch normalization (BN). Among them, combined upsampling and joint attention facilitate mutual learning between multiple-stream networks by integrating multi-parameter priors in both additive and multiplicative manners. Long-range unified skip connections within SBNs ensure effective information propagation between distant cross-fusion layers. Additionally, incorporating dual-normalized edge-orientation similarity regularization into the training loss enhances detail reconstruction and prevents overfitting. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that PEARL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised AMRI technologies in various MRI cases. Notably, 5-fold $\\sim$ 6-fold accelerated acquisition yields a 1 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 2 $\\%$ improvement in SSIM $_{ROI}$ and a 3 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 6 $\\%$ improvement in PSNR $_{ROI}$ , along with a significant 15 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 20 $\\%$ reduction in RLNE $_{ROI}$ .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |[Qingyong Zhu, Bei Liu, Zhuo-Xu Cui, Chentao Cao, Xiaomeng Yan, Yuanyuan Liu, Jing Cheng, Yihang Zhou, Yanjie Zhu, Haifeng Wang, Hongwu Zeng, Dong Liang] |[{Qingyong Zhu, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong}, {Bei Liu, Xi'an, School of Mathematics, Northwest University, Xi'an, School of Mathematics, Northwest University}, {Zhuo-Xu Cui, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong}, {Chentao Cao, China, Paul C.

      "|07 June 2024     |7  |June     |2024|676728b19f52b39d78163072|Knowledge guidance is crucial for bridging the gap between high-level AI ethics principles and the practical implementation of responsible AI systems. Diverging from static knowledge inference and temporal interpolation, the task of temporal knowledge extrapolation, which entails predicting future facts based on the evolution of historical facts, poses formidable challenges that remain largely unsolved. In existing temporal extrapolation methods, the structural learning of concurrent facts is primarily addressed by utilizing relation-aware graph neural networks. However, the temporal validity of facts leads to the sparsity of temporal subgraphs, where inherent coarse-level learning mechanisms hinder the capture of nuanced and scarce local semantics. Thus, this paper proposes a fine-grained tensor graph attention network (F-GAT) that promotes representation learning of concurrent facts on sparse subgraphs by effectively distinguishing the significance of entities and relations within tr...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |[Jing Yang, Chengxuan Huang, Xiangli Yang, Laurence T.

This study investigates an improved nonlinear extended disturbance observer and its application in electro-hydraulic servo system, which represents a typical nonlinear system. The focus lies in estimating the external disturbance and its nth-order derivates of the system to enhance the robustness and precision of the control system. Additionally, we introduce a high gain observer dedicated to estimating the system's velocity. Finally, we establish a sliding mode controller based on the improved disturbance observer and high gain observer, aiming to mitigate the impact of external force disturbances. Comparative experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of this approach.

Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on nonrepeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, compositional replay using memory blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB concatenates trainable and reusable memory block vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Storing the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing it toward attending to information about object shapes more than information about image textures and stabilizes the network during stream learning by providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that stores and replays raw images while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on seven challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce two new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With only 3.7%â4.1% as much memory and 15%â43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art.

To evaluate consumer acceptance, the study incorporates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and extends it with attributes specific to AI, such as Perceived Reliability, Voice Quality, and Quality of Information. Advanced statistical methods, including structural equation modeling with SPSS AMOS 28 and SmartPLS, were utilized to analyze the collected data.\\nFindings:\\nThe results revealed that Perceived Reliability and Quality of Information were significant predictors of AI voice assistant adoption in the telecom sector, while traditional factors such as Perceived Usefulness and Trust showed no significant impact. These findings suggest that performance-related elements play a more crucial role in user acceptance of AI in this context compared to earlier technological acceptance models.\\nImplications:\\nThe study offers an expansion to traditional technology acceptance models by highlighting the importance of AI-specific attributes over conventional factors like Perceived Usefulness and Trust. For telecom operators in developing markets, this research provides guidance on enhancing customer engagement with AI voice assistants. It suggests focusing on improving the reliability and quality of information provided by AI systems to boost user acceptance.\\nOriginality/value:\\nThe study provides valuable insights into the changing dynamics of consumer acceptance of AI in customer support, emphasizing a shift toward performance-based criteria. Telecom companies in Jordan can use these findings to inform their AI adoption strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.                                                                   |[Mousa Al-Kfairy, Dheya Mustafa, Ahmed Al-Adaileh, Samah Zriqat, Obsa Sendaba]                                                                            |[{Mousa Al-Kfairy, United Arab Emirates, College of Technological Innovation, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, P.O.

      "|30 September 2024|30 |September|2024|676728b19f52b39d781630ca|Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) utilizes multiple distributed access points (APs) to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE). However, challenging propagation environments can degrade communication performance due to substantial penetration loss. Integrating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into CF mMIMO can mitigate these issues by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the incident signals and adjusting the coefficients of its elements, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint precoding design of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems to maximize the sum SE. This involves refining the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. We introduce a fully distributed heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm that incorporates trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Unlike conventional multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on centralized training and execution, our HATRPO algorithm uses only local channel state information, reducing the need for high backhaul capacity by 13%. Simulation results demonstrate that our HATRPO algorithm significantly improves the sum SE in various scenarios                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |[Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Enyu Shi, Ziheng Liu, Chau Yuen, Dusit Niyato, Bo Ai]                                                                           |[{Yiyang Zhu, P.

      "|27 November 2024 |27 |November |2024|676728b19f52b39d781631be|Detecting leaks in natural gas pipelines using acoustic signals typically requires extensive prior knowledge and complex parameter designs, making it challenging to handle background noise and data distribution disparities simultaneously. This article proposes a dual-feature drift framework utilizing a nonparametric design approach for acoustic signal-based leak detection. This framework consists of two core technologies: first, feature backward normalization. Low-dimensional drift factors are designed based on transformed acoustic signals to exponentially normalize the time-periodic features of the signal feature matrix, thereby eliminating strong background noise. Second, constructing the feature drift layer within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Weighted parameters constrain a high-dimensional feature matrix, developing drift factors that perform exponential drift on each feature, thus enhancing gradient constraints and eliminating data distribution differences during model training. This framework achieves a fault identification accuracy of 95.46% for natural gas pipeline leaks, outperforming competing methods and representing a novel approach to intelligent pipeline leak detection.

However, existing learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes, potentially leading to failed predictions in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce IMGTP, a unified framework for systematically evaluating, improving, and measuring the generalization performance of trajectory prediction models in OOD scenes. IMGTP consists of three primary components: the Argoverse-Shift dataset, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy, and an approach for OOD measurement. First, the Argoverse-Shift is a cross-domain dataset that highlights the significant differences in data distributions across domains, serving as a testing platform for models' generalization ability. Second, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy leverages map centerlines and the FrenÃÂ©t Frame to enhance the generalizability of baseline models by mitigating the domain gap resulting from road geometry variations. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology for OOD measurement, quantifying the range of data that can be effectively handled by prediction models. This measurement approach employs the accuracy rate of the correctly predicted samples and their corresponding mean distance as well as standard deviation to the training set center as indicators of the model's generalization ability. The mean distance also serves as a valid criterion for OOD detection and uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that our IMGTP framework enhances the generalization capability of mainstream trajectory prediction models by substantially improving their prediction performance in unseen domains. This advancement contributes to developing more robust and safer prediction models for autonomous driving in the real world.

However, even high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) based electricity price forecasting (EPF) models have instances when their prediction error is much higher than those shown by mean performance metrics. To date, explainable AI has been used to enhance the model transparency and trustworthiness of AI-based EPF models. However, this paper demonstrates that insights from explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be expanded beyond its primary task of explanatory visualizations. This work presents a XAI-based error compensation approach to improve model performance and identify irregular predictions. The first phase of the proposed approach involves error quantification through a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) based corrector model that fine-tunes the base predictorâs forecasts. Using this corrector modelâs SHAP explanations, the proposed approach distinguishes high-accuracy pre...

Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information, which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control (CIDC) framework for formation control in diverse scenarios. This framework splits the driving task into three modules: static trajectory planning, order allocation, and dynamic optimal tracking. First, in the static trajectory planning module, static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories, freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency. Second, in the order allocation module, reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected, determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time. Finally, in the dynamic optimal tracking module, a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles, thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations. Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment, making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving, deliver and platoon driving

      "|16 September 2024|16 |September|2024|676728b19f52b39d78162ffc|Bees play a crucial role in human food production and ecosystem maintenance. However, they face a global crisis characterized by significant population decline, including colony collapse disorder, which threatens their survival. Therefore, the development of precision beekeeping IoT systems is pivotal for enhancing bee colony strength. This study analyzes and categorizes the research focusing on the colony strength into two main areas based on colony activity and threat detection. Research on colony activity aids beekeepers to effectively manage their hives by analyzing behaviors, such as internal status, swarming, and traffic. In threat detection, research focuses on identifying critical predators, such as hornets and varroa destructor that significantly affect colony survival. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review, thoroughly presenting findings on the evolution and diversification of methodologies aimed at enhancing colony strength. By delving into various innovative approaches and assessing their effectiveness, this review highlights key developments that have significantly contributed to improving the resilience of bee populations against emerging threats. Furthermore, this study identifies the limitations of current research and proposes future research directions focused on enhancing the accuracy of bee behavior analysis and threat detection to improve colony strength and productivity.

      "|25 September 2024|25 |September|2024|676728b19f52b39d781631ed|Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world. Technologies such as the medical Internet of Things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely:\\nâ\\n1\\n(Policy and Compliance Management),\\nâ\\n2\\n(Employee Training and Awareness),\\nâ\\n3\\n(Data Protection and Privacy Control),\\nâ\\n4\\n(Monitoring and Response), and\\nâ\\n5\\n(Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that\\nâ\\n3\\nactivities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by\\nâ\\n1\\nand\\nâ\\n2\\nactivities. Finally,\\nâ\\n4\\nand\\nâ\\n5\\nshould be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.

Observations from different sources on an object can conflict with each other due to errors, missing records, typos, outdated data, etc. How to discover truth facts for objects from various sources is essential and urgent. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive and exhaustive survey on truth discovery problems from the perspectives of concepts, methods, applications, and opportunities. We first systematically review and compare problems from objects, sources, and observations. Based on these problem properties, different methods are analyzed and compared in depth from observation with single or multiple values, independent or dependent sources, static or dynamic sources, and supervised or unsupervised learning, followed by the surveyed applications in various scenarios. For future studies in truth discovery fields, we summarize the code sources and datasets used in above methods. Finally, we point out the potential challenges and opportunities on truth discovery, with the goal of shedding light and promoting further investigation in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |[Shuang Wang, He Zhang, Quan Z.

      "|13 August 2024   |13 |August   |2024|676728b19f52b39d78162f8e|The Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, particularly the rise of Generative AI, necessitates a paradigm shift in engineering organizations. This article draws parallels with the cloud revolution, highlighting the need for deeper integrations of AI expertise within engineering teams. We discuss the evolution of product engineering during the cloud era, emphasizing the transition from specialized functional teams to a more integrated model leveraging cloud-native capabilities. We then delve into the challenges and opportunities presented by AI-integrated products, advocating for a distributed model of AI expertise where AI skills are embedded within existing teams. We outline the benefits of this approach, such as accelerated development, deeper AI understanding, and a culture of continuous learning. Finally, we address the challenges of talent gaps, cultural resistance, and integration complexity, offering strategies for mitigation. By embracing a proactive and strategic approach, engineering organizations can successfully navigate the AI revolution and reap its full benefits.

However, this advancement brings forth challenges in data ownership, as emphasized by the General Data Protection Regulationâs right to be forgotten. The right to be forgotten allows participants to erase their data contributions from well-trained AIGC models. Training AIGC models demands an extensive amount of data and computations, often surpassing the capabilities of individual participants. As a solution, Federated Learning (FL) is employed to collaboratively train an AIGC model without sharing raw data directly. To protect the right to be forgotten in FL, âfederated unlearningâ has been introduced to eradicate the data contributions of unlearning participants from fully trained AIGC models, achieved by deleting historical model updates. However, given that historical updates are distributed among various participants, they may still hold contributions from the unlearning participants. This presents a challenge to the trustworthiness of federated unlearning. In this paper, we first provide an overview of both centralized and federated learning and unlearning methods. We survey relevant works and classify four main categories for federated unlearning. Subsequently, we introduce a comprehensive decentralized unlearning architecture designed for trustworthy AIGC services. To address the challenge of participants retaining historical contributions from unlearning participants, we integrate a coded computing-based interaction mechanism, ensuring both scalability and security. We further present a case study using NanoGPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for decentralized unlearning. We conclude by identifying potential future research directions.

This paper proposes a novel biosensing concept by combining the Long-Range surface plasmon resonance (LRSPR) phenomenon and the tunneling effect induced by Frustrated total-internal reflection (FTIR). Multilayer sensing structures with energy transfer effects excited by LRSPR were designed. For the first time, a structure with two metal layers sandwiched between three dielectric matching layer(DML) film layers is proposed. The bilayer of the lithium fluoride (LiF)-Au-titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) film layer structure can enhance the surface electric field of the sensor, which makes the sensor structure have high sensitivity and FOM. The sensitivity of the sensor is 4869 nm/RIU under external conditions with a refractive index(RI) of 1.33223-1.37223 RIU, which is 1.2 times higher than the conventional surface plasmon resonance (CSPR) sensors, and the FOM can reach 41.26 RIU -1 , which is 1.72 times higher than the CSPR sensors. In addition, the TiO2 and LiF in this sensor are less prone to collapse, and the stability test results show that the relative standard deviation (RSD) is 0.4091%, which demonstrates good reliability and stability. The LRSPR sensor has the high sensitivity and FOM, and long detection distance, which makes it practical in the field of biochemical sensing.

However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment. Note to Practitioners âDiagnosing MCI allows for timely intervention and treatment measures to potentially slow down or even halt further cognitive decline.

One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters, like dopamine and nor-epinephrine, in cortical circuits. In terms of symbolic processing, these neuromodulators add âsalienceâ to various emotions and experiences. A salience-based neural network (SANN) architecture was proposed in [1]. We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications. In the context of underwater, surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos. Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes. However, while applying the same for underwater environments, it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details that are important for definin...

We showcase his pioneering breakthroughs in minimax optimization, p th norm formulations, yield optimization, and nonlinear circuit design optimization. We highlight advances in direct electromagnetic (EM) microwave optimization, circuit response sensitivities, and efficient S -parameters sensitivity calculations. We explore the port-tuning version of space mapping (SM) for EM-based analysis, techniques for industrial microwave design of satellite systems, and post-manufacture hardware tuning. The integration of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with SM for enhanced EM-based design optimization and yield prediction, cognition-driven microwave filter design, and parallels between SM and artificial intelligence (AI) is examined. Finally, we speculate on the future integration of cognitive science with engineering design, leveraging the synergy of AI, machine learning (ML), and SM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |[JosÃ© E.

Some self-supervised frameworks, such as deep image prior (DIP), have emerged, eliminating the explicit training procedure but often struggling to remove noise and artifacts under significant degradation. This work introduces a novel self-supervised accelerated parallel MRI approach called PEARL, leveraging a multiple-stream joint deep decoder with two cross-fusion schemes to accurately reconstruct one or more target images from compressively sampled k-space. Each stream comprises cascaded cross-fusion sub-block networks (SBNs) that sequentially perform combined upsampling, 2D convolution, joint attention, ReLU activation and batch normalization (BN). Among them, combined upsampling and joint attention facilitate mutual learning between multiple-stream networks by integrating multi-parameter priors in both additive and multiplicative manners. Long-range unified skip connections within SBNs ensure effective information propagation between distant cross-fusion layers. Additionally, incorporating dual-normalized edge-orientation similarity regularization into the training loss enhances detail reconstruction and prevents overfitting. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that PEARL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised AMRI technologies in various MRI cases. Notably, 5-fold $\\sim$ 6-fold accelerated acquisition yields a 1 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 2 $\\%$ improvement in SSIM $_{ROI}$ and a 3 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 6 $\\%$ improvement in PSNR $_{ROI}$ , along with a significant 15 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 20 $\\%$ reduction in RLNE $_{ROI}$ .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |[Qingyong Zhu, Bei Liu, Zhuo-Xu Cui, Chentao Cao, Xiaomeng Yan, Yuanyuan Liu, Jing Cheng, Yihang Zhou, Yanjie Zhu, Haifeng Wang, Hongwu Zeng, Dong Liang] |[{Qingyong Zhu, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong}, {Bei Liu, Xi'an, School of Mathematics, Northwest University, Xi'an, School of Mathematics, Northwest University}, {Zhuo-Xu Cui, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, Medical AI Research Centre, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, Shenzhen, Guangdong}, {Chentao Cao, China, Paul C.

Diverging from static knowledge inference and temporal interpolation, the task of temporal knowledge extrapolation, which entails predicting future facts based on the evolution of historical facts, poses formidable challenges that remain largely unsolved. In existing temporal extrapolation methods, the structural learning of concurrent facts is primarily addressed by utilizing relation-aware graph neural networks. However, the temporal validity of facts leads to the sparsity of temporal subgraphs, where inherent coarse-level learning mechanisms hinder the capture of nuanced and scarce local semantics. Thus, this paper proposes a fine-grained tensor graph attention network (F-GAT) that promotes representation learning of concurrent facts on sparse subgraphs by effectively distinguishing the significance of entities and relations within tr...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |[Jing Yang, Chengxuan Huang, Xiangli Yang, Laurence T.

This study investigates an improved nonlinear extended disturbance observer and its application in electro-hydraulic servo system, which represents a typical nonlinear system. The focus lies in estimating the external disturbance and its nth-order derivates of the system to enhance the robustness and precision of the control system. Additionally, we introduce a high gain observer dedicated to estimating the system's velocity. Finally, we establish a sliding mode controller based on the improved disturbance observer and high gain observer, aiming to mitigate the impact of external force disturbances. Comparative experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of this approach.

Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on nonrepeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, compositional replay using memory blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB concatenates trainable and reusable memory block vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Storing the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing it toward attending to information about object shapes more than information about image textures and stabilizes the network during stream learning by providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that stores and replays raw images while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on seven challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce two new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With only 3.7%â4.1% as much memory and 15%â43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art.

To evaluate consumer acceptance, the study incorporates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and extends it with attributes specific to AI, such as Perceived Reliability, Voice Quality, and Quality of Information. Advanced statistical methods, including structural equation modeling with SPSS AMOS 28 and SmartPLS, were utilized to analyze the collected data.\\nFindings:\\nThe results revealed that Perceived Reliability and Quality of Information were significant predictors of AI voice assistant adoption in the telecom sector, while traditional factors such as Perceived Usefulness and Trust showed no significant impact. These findings suggest that performance-related elements play a more crucial role in user acceptance of AI in this context compared to earlier technological acceptance models.\\nImplications:\\nThe study offers an expansion to traditional technology acceptance models by highlighting the importance of AI-specific attributes over conventional factors like Perceived Usefulness and Trust. For telecom operators in developing markets, this research provides guidance on enhancing customer engagement with AI voice assistants. It suggests focusing on improving the reliability and quality of information provided by AI systems to boost user acceptance.\\nOriginality/value:\\nThe study provides valuable insights into the changing dynamics of consumer acceptance of AI in customer support, emphasizing a shift toward performance-based criteria. Telecom companies in Jordan can use these findings to inform their AI adoption strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.                                                                   |[Mousa Al-Kfairy, Dheya Mustafa, Ahmed Al-Adaileh, Samah Zriqat, Obsa Sendaba]                                                                            |[{Mousa Al-Kfairy, United Arab Emirates, College of Technological Innovation, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, P.O.

      "|27 November 2024 |27 |November |2024|Detecting leaks in natural gas pipelines using acoustic signals typically requires extensive prior knowledge and complex parameter designs making it challenging to handle background noise and data distribution disparities simultaneously This article proposes a dual-feature drift framework utilizing a nonparametric design approach for acoustic signal-based leak detection This framework consists of two core technologies first feature backward normalization Low-dimensional drift factors are designed based on transformed acoustic signals to exponentially normalize the time-periodic features of the signal feature matrix thereby eliminating strong background noise Second constructing the feature drift layer within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network Weighted parameters constrain a high-dimensional feature matrix developing drift factors that perform exponential drift on each feature thus enhancing gradient constraints and eliminating data distribution differences during model training This framework achieves a fault identification accuracy of 9546 for natural gas pipeline leaks outperforming competing methods and

      "|14 February 2024 |14 |February |2024|Accurately predicting nearby agents' future trajectories is fundamental for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving However existing learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with poor generalization to out-of-distribution OOD scenes potentially leading to failed predictions in real-world applications To tackle this challenge we introduce IMGTP a unified framework for systematically evaluating improving and measuring the generalization performance of trajectory prediction models in OOD scenes IMGTP consists of three primary components the Argoverse-Shift dataset the FrenÃÂt strategy and an approach for OOD measurement First the Argoverse-Shift is a cross-domain dataset that highlights the significant differences in data distributions across domains serving as a testing platform for models' generalization ability Second the FrenÃÂt strategy leverages map centerlines and the FrenÃÂt Frame to enhance the generalizability of baseline models by mitigating the domain gap resulting from road geometry variations Third we provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology for OOD measurement quantifying the range of data that can be effectively handled by prediction models This measurement approach employs the accuracy rate of the correctly predicted samples and their corresponding mean distance as well as standard deviation to the training set center as indicators of the model's generalization ability The mean distance also serves as a valid criterion for OOD detection and uncertainty quantification Experimental results demonstrate that our IMGTP framework enhances the generalization capability of mainstream trajectory prediction models by substantially improving their prediction performance in unseen domains This advancement contributes to developing more robust and safer prediction models for autonomous driving in the real world The code can be found at

      "|20 August 2024   |20 |August   |2024|Intelligent connected vehicles integrate smart systems and network communication to enhance safety and efficiency making them widely applicable for formation control in diverse scenarios Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations In this paper we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control CIDC framework for formation control in diverse scenarios This framework splits the driving task into three modules static trajectory planning order allocation and dynamic optimal tracking First in the static trajectory planning module static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency Second in the order allocation module reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time Finally in the dynamic optimal tracking module a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving deliver and platoon driving

      "|16 September 2024|16 |September|2024|Bees play a crucial role in human food production and ecosystem maintenance However they face a global crisis characterized by significant population decline including colony collapse disorder which threatens their survival Therefore the development of precision beekeeping IoT systems is pivotal for enhancing bee colony strength This study analyzes and categorizes the research focusing on the colony strength into two main areas based on colony activity and threat detection Research on colony activity aids beekeepers to effectively manage their hives by analyzing behaviors such as internal status swarming and traffic In threat detection research focuses on identifying critical predators such as hornets and varroa destructor that significantly affect colony survival This study conducts a comprehensive literature review thoroughly presenting findings on the evolution and diversification of methodologies aimed at enhancing colony strength By delving into various innovative approaches and assessing their effectiveness this review highlights key developments that have significantly contributed to improving the resilience of bee populations against emerging threats Furthermore this study identifies the limitations of current research and proposes future research directions focused on enhancing the accuracy of bee behavior analysis and threat detection to improve colony strength and productivity

      "|25 September 2024|25 |September|2024|Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world Technologies such as the medical Internet of Things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis prognosis or even treatment of disease This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information PHI The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namelyâ1Policy and Compliance Managementâ2Employee Training and Awarenessâ3Data Protection and Privacy Controlâ4Monitoring and Response andâ5Technology and Infrastructure Security and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities criteria for categorization and prioritization Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise DBSCAN and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution TOPSIS The outcomes conclude thatâ3activities should be given first preference in implementation and followed byâ1andâ2activities Finallyâ4andâ5should be implemented The prioritized view of identified clustered

      "|06 August 2024   |6  |August   |2024|The widespread adoption of AI-Generated Content AIGC has captured remarkable interests from academia and industry However this advancement brings forth challenges in data ownership as emphasized by the General Data Protection Regulationâs right to be forgotten The right to be forgotten allows participants to erase their data contributions from well-trained AIGC models Training AIGC models demands an extensive amount of data and computations often surpassing the capabilities of individual participants As a solution Federated Learning FL is employed to collaboratively train an AIGC model without sharing raw data directly To protect the right to be forgotten in FL âfederated unlearningâ has been introduced to eradicate the data contributions of unlearning participants from fully trained AIGC models achieved by deleting historical model updates However given that historical updates are distributed among various participants they may still hold contributions from the unlearning participants This presents a challenge to the trustworthiness of federated unlearning In this paper we first provide an overview of both centralized and federated learning and unlearning methods We survey relevant works and classify four main categories for federated unlearning Subsequently we introduce a comprehensive decentralized unlearning architecture designed for trustworthy AIGC services To address the challenge of participants retaining historical contributions from unlearning participants we integrate a coded computing-based interaction mechanism ensuring both scalability and security We further present a case study using NanoGPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for decentralized unlearning We conclude by identifying potential future research directions

      "|01 October 2024  |1  |October  |2024|To reduce the full-width half maximumsFWHM of the surface plasmon resonance SPR fiber sensor and to improve the sensitivity and figure of meritFOM This paper proposes a novel biosensing concept by combining the Long-Range surface plasmon resonance LRSPR phenomenon and the tunneling effect induced by Frustrated total-internal reflection FTIR Multilayer sensing structures with energy transfer effects excited by LRSPR were designed For the first time a structure with two metal layers sandwiched between three dielectric matching layerDML film layers is proposed The bilayer of the lithium fluoride LiF-Au-titanium dioxide TiO 2  film layer structure can enhance the surface electric field of the sensor which makes the sensor structure have high sensitivity and FOM The sensitivity of the sensor is 4869 nmRIU under external conditions with a refractive indexRI of 133223-137223 RIU which is 12 times higher than the conventional surface plasmon resonance CSPR sensors and the FOM can reach 4126 RIU -1  which is 172 times higher than the CSPR sensors In addition the TiO2 and LiF in this sensor are less prone to collapse and the stability test results show that the relative standard deviation RSD is 04091 which demonstrates good reliability and stability The LRSPR sensor has the high sensitivity and FOM and long detection distance which makes it practical in the field of biochemical sensing

functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions In this paper a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer BDHT is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment MCI analysis To our best knowledge the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks Specifically the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy To improve denoising quality the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network the graph convolutional transformer GraphConformer module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches Moreover the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment Note to

      "|28 October 2024  |28 |October  |2024|The human brain is exceedingly good at learning rich narratives from highly limited experiences One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters like dopamine and nor-epinephrine in cortical circuits In terms of symbolic processing these neuromodulators add âsalienceâ to various emotions and experiences A salience-based neural network SANN architecture was proposed in 1 We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications In the context of underwater surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes However while applying the same for underwater environments it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details
