        "abstract": "In the early days of IoTâs introduction, it was challenging to introduce encryption communication due to the lack of performance of each component, such as computing resources like CPUs and batteries, to encrypt and decrypt data. Because IoT is applied and utilized in many important fields, a cyberattack on IoT can result in astronomical financial and human casualties. For this reason, the application of encrypted communication to IoT has been required, and the application of encrypted communication to IoT has become possible due to improvements in the computing performance of IoT devices and the development of lightweight cryptography. The application of encrypted communication in IoT has made it possible to use encrypted communication channels to launch cyberattacks. The approach of extracting evidence of an attack based on the primary information of a network packet is no longer valid because critical information, such as the payload in a network packet, is encrypted by encrypted communication. For this reason, technology that can detect cyberattacks over encrypted network traffic occurring in IoT environments is required. Therefore, this research proposes an encrypted cyberattack detection system for the IoT (ECDS-IoT) that derives valid features for cyberattack detection from the cryptographic network traffic generated in the IoT environment and performs cyberattack detection based on the derived features. ECDS-IoT identifies identifiable information from encrypted traffic collected in IoT environments and extracts statistics-based features through statistical analysis of identifiable information. ECDS-IoT understands information about normal data by learning only statistical features extracted from normal data. ECDS-IoT detects cyberattacks based only on the normal data information it has trained. To evaluate the cyberattack detection performance of the proposed ECDS-IoT in this research, ECDS-IoT used CICIoT2023, a dataset containing encrypted traffic generated by normal and seven categories of cyberattacks in the IoT environment and experimented with cyberattack detection on encrypted traffic using Autoencoder, RNN, GRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and AE-LSTM algorithms. As a result of evaluating the performance of cyberattack detection for encrypted traffic, ECDS-IoT achieved high performance such as accuracy 0.99739, precision 0.99154, recall 1.0, F1 score 0.99575, and ROC_AUC 0.99822 when using the AE-LSTM algorithm. As shown by the cyberattack detection results of ECDS-IoT, it is possible to detect most cyberattacks through encrypted traffic. By applying ECDS-IoT to IoT, it can effectively detect cyberattacks concealed in encrypted traffic, promoting the efficient operation of IoT and preventing financial and human damage caused by cyberattacks.",

These smart objects are susceptible to cybersecurity threats and are easily affected by IoT malware. Malwares, if not detected, can harm different components of the IoT: smart objects, communication network, and the applications, leading to data theft and privacy breach. Despite that machine learning is incredibly successful at detecting malware, it cannot be deployed in IoT environment due to its computation complexity and high processing resources it demands. This paper proposes a lightweight machine learning framework for real-time IoT malware detection with limited computing burden. The framework is based on novel feature extraction technique; the Matrix Block Mean Downsampling (MBMD), and various machine learning algorithms are implemented. The experiments carried out on BODMAS dataset show the superiority of the proposed approach in detecting IoT malware with an F1-score of more than 99%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advent of advanced technological developments such as IoT, edge, and fog computing, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated. IoT networks facilitate collaborative and intelligent tasks across various domains, including Industry 4.0, digital healthcare, and home automation. However, the proliferation of IoT devices has raised concerns about severe attacks, particularly those targeting resource constraints such as energy and memory. In response to these challenges, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has emerged as a new research area, focusing on machine learning techniques tailored for embedded and IoT systems. This study proposes an ML detection mechanism designed to categorize and detect resource-constrained attacks in IoT devices. We consider IoT devices to be integral components within the continuum of edge and cloud computing, leveraging EdgeML and CloudML for detection purposes. Our paper conducts a comparative analysis of ML models, with a specific focus on energy consumption and memory usage in IoT applications. We compare various ML methodologies, including cloud-based, edge-based, and device-based strategies for both training and detection. The evaluation encompasses the application of these ML techniques to petite IoT devices, utilizing TinyML, as well as cloud and edge devices. Our findings reveal that the Decision Tree algorithm deployed on smart devices surpasses other approaches in terms of training efficiency, resource utilization, and the ability to detect resource-constrained attacks on IoT devices. We demonstrate a high level of accuracy, exceeding 96.9%, across all presented ML models in detecting resource constraint attacks within IoT systems. In summary, this research serves as a guide for implementing effective security measures in the dynamic landscape of IoT and associated technologies.",

These applications are based on enabling IoT devices to communicate directly with satellites. In this scenario, LEO satellites can provide global IoT service coverage, becoming essential to connect devices in remote areas. As an example, the deployment of NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) service is being actively investigated with the apparition of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) and DtS-IoT concepts. Although some initiatives propose seamless and ubiquitous service, these features may not be required for IoT applications. This relaxes the requirements in the satellite constellation architecture, enabling it to be more sparse. The connection between sensors, satellites and ground segment becomes intermittent and discontinuous in these non-dense architectures. Delay/Disruptive-tolerant protocols are essential to coexist with this network characteristics. Unfortunately, traditional IoT protocols have not been designed with this delay-tolerant feature. This work tackles this challenge by integrating Delay-Tolerant Network protocols with NB-IoT architecture. Specifically, the integration is based on interconnecting the Bundle Protocol and IP traffic through a novel interface. This development has been divided in three phases: (1) The definition of an architecture and protocol stack to tackle NTN IoT scenarios with discontinuities, (2) the analysis from simulated data of the resulting protocol stack in a realistic scenario based on flooding prevention, and (3) the implementation and validation of it in a laboratory testbed. The proposed case study uses a Direct-to-Satellite IoT architecture to create an early warning flooding detection system. The simulation results provide insights of the achieved performance with these architectures when servicing hundreds of sensing nodes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nData trading is a crucial means of unlocking the value of Internet of Things (IoT) data. However, IoT data differs from traditional material goods due to its intangible and replicable nature. This difference leads to ambiguous data rights, confusing pricing, and challenges in matching. Additionally, centralized IoT data trading platforms pose risks such as privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a profit-driven distributed trading mechanism for IoT data. First, a blockchain-based trading architecture for IoT data, leveraging the transparent and tamper-proof features of blockchain technology, is proposed to establish trust between data owners and data requesters. Second, an IoT data registration method that encompasses both rights confirmation and pricing is designed. The data right confirmation method uses non-fungible token to record ownership and authenticate IoT data. For pricing, we develop an IoT data value assessment index system and introduce a pricing model based on a combination of the sparrow search algorithm and the back propagation neural network. Finally, an IoT data matching method is designed based on the Stackelberg game. This establishes a Stackelberg game model involving multiple data owners and requesters, employing a hierarchical optimization method to determine the optimal purchase strategy. The security of the mechanism is analyzed and the performance of both the pricing method and matching method is evaluated. Experiments demonstrate that both methods outperform traditional approaches in terms of error rates and profit maximization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThousands of smart gadgets are linked to the internet each month, and due to various privacy and security issues, such devices may be vulnerable to evil attackers. Currently, there are around 8 billion devices online, and by the beginning of 2025, there will likely be 25 to 35 billion IoT devices globally. Despite this, the security of the devices is not receiving any more attention. Since operating system (OS) and hardware security have improved recently, researchers and hackers now seek vulnerabilities in other areas, such as firmware. When the firmware on many IoT devices isn't updated, it leaves them open to cyberattacks. The period when the Mirai Botnet was widely used is one of the situations in which we may have heard about firmware security. By gaining access to the equipment using the default credentials, the Mirai Botnet infects devices. Therefore, to analyze the firmware's contents for alteration during runtime, the authors of this research performed reverse engineering on it. Authors have exploited the smart home IoT firmware using our framework that identified ten critical network-based vulnerabilities within the firmware, with five vulnerabilities scoring a maximum CVSS score of 10.0 and the remaining five scoring 9.8, highlighting significant threats to smart home IoT devices. In addition, examining the firmware binaries demonstrates the widespread usage of dangerous functions like sprintf and strcpy in addition to the absence of critical security features like NX, PIE, RELRO, and stack protection. By offering a thorough analysis of the vulnerabilities and suggesting best practices for boosting the security of smart home IoT firmware, the results add to the body of information already in existence.",

However, because of the wide range of devices it encompasses, it is also facing increased security vulnerabilities. This research presents a novel mechanism called the self-attention-based 1D-CNN-LSTM, which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) model enhanced with a self-Attention mechanism for detecting IoT attacks. The proposed mechanism achieves high accuracy and efficiently differentiates malicious and benign network traffic. By employing Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), we identified important predictive features from the preprocessed data, which were retrieved using CICFlowMeter. This has strengthened the dependability of the model. In addition, we enhanced the model by training it on a smaller collection of features, resulting in shorter training time while preserving accuracy. We have also generated nine augmented IoT tabular datasets named CIC-BCCC-NRC_TabularIoTAttack-2024 from accessible IoT datasets to evaluate the model's robustness and showcase its efficacy in IoT security.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntrusion detection in the Internet of Things (IoTs) is a vital unit of IoT safety. IoT devices face diverse kinds of attacks, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a significant role in detecting and responding to these threats. A typical IDS solution can be utilized from the IoT networks for monitoring traffic, device behaviour, and system logs for signs of intrusion or abnormal movement. Deep learning (DL) approaches are exposed to promise in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of IDS for IoT devices. Blockchain (BC) aided intrusion detection from IoT platforms provides many benefits, including better data integrity, transparency, and resistance to tampering. This paper projects a novel sandpiper optimizer with hybrid deep learning-based intrusion detection (SPOHDL-ID) from the BC-assisted IoT platform. The key contribution of the SPOHDL-ID model is to accomplish security via the intrusion detection and classification process from the IoT platform. In this case, the BC technology can be used for a secure data-sharing process. In the presented SPOHDL-ID technique, the selection of features from the network traffic data takes place using the SPO model. Besides, the SPOHDL-ID technique employs the HDL model for intrusion detection, which involves the design of a convolutional neural network with a stacked autoencoder (CNN-SAE) model. The beetle search optimizer algorithm (BSOA) method is used for the hyperparameter tuning procedure to increase the recognition outcomes of the CNN-SAE technique. An extensive simulation outcome is created to exhibit a better solution to the SPOHDL-ID method. The experimental validation of the SPOHDL-ID method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.59â¯% and 99.54â¯% over recent techniques under the ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets.",

Traditional security policies designed for static environments fall short of addressing the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained nature of IoT ecosystems. Existing dynamic security policy models lack versatility and fail to fully integrate comprehensive risk assessments, regulatory compliance, and AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning)-driven adaptability. We develop a novel adaptive edge security framework that dynamically generates and adjusts security policies for IoT edge devices. Our framework integrates a dynamic security policy generator, a conflict detection and resolution in policy generator, a bias-aware risk assessment system, a regulatory compliance analysis system, and an AI-driven adaptability integration system. This approach produces tailored security policies that adapt to changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and device statuses. Our study identifies critical security challenges in diverse IoT environments and demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework through simulations and real-world scenarios. We found that our framework significantly enhances the adaptability and resilience of IoT security policies. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI/ML integration in creating responsive and robust security measures for IoT ecosystems. The implications of our findings suggest that dynamic and adaptive security frameworks are essential for protecting IoT devices against evolving cyber threats, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, and maintaining the integrity and availability of IoT services across various applications.",

The research focuses on how IoT enhances Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices within organizations, addressing key sustainability challenges and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study identifies three primary findings: (1) IoT applications directly enhance power source management in the environmental domain, improving Business Strategy and Long-term Growth (BSLG) and Measurement and Reporting (M&R) capabilities. This is achieved through real-time monitoring, smart building management, and predictive maintenance. In the social sphere, IoT strengthens supply chain transparency, bolstering Stakeholder Management (SM) through real-time tracking and blockchain-integrated systems for product authenticity verification. IoT comprehensively empowers performing risk management in the governance realm, improving Organizational Culture (OC) through early warning systems and predictive analytics for risk mitigation. (2) IoT integration facilitates Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM), Real-Time Responsiveness (RTR), and Business Risk Management (BRM), key components of IoT-DMC. Furthermore, it supports the development of Effective Stakeholder Management (ESM), Resource Efficiency (RE), and Sustainable Competitive Outcomes (SCO) within IoT-CSL. (3) While highlighting the potential of IoT in advancing CSL, the research also acknowledges challenges such as initial investment costs, data privacy concerns, technological complexity, energy consumption of IoT devices, and electronic waste management. The study concludes that successful IoT implementation in CSL requires careful planning, robust data management, and a holistic approach considering both benefits and potential drawbacks.",

However, unsecured IoT devices are susceptible to botnet-based attacks such as distributed denial of Service (DDoS). Conventional machine learning models used for detecting these attacks compromise data privacy, prompting the adoption of federated learning (FL) to improve privacy. Yet, most FL-based cyberattack detection models proposed for IoT environments do not address computational complexity to suit their deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. This paper introduces an FL model with low computational complexity, designed for detecting IoT botnet attacks. The study employs feature selection and dimensionality reduction to minimize computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. First, an extreme gradient boosting model, trained with repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation, is used to select the optimal features of the botnet dataset based on feature importance. Principal component analysis is then used to reduce the dimensionality of these features. Finally, a differentially private multi-layer perceptron is trained locally by four FL clients and aggregated through federated averaging (FedAvg) to form a global Mirai botnet attack detection model. The model achieved an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 99.93 %, an area under the curve of 1.0, and 8,612 floating-point operations, contributing to 87.34 % reduction in computational complexity compared to the previous work. The proposed model is well-suited for detecting botnet attacks in smart homes, smart grids, and environments where resource-constrained IoT edge devices are deployed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has connected millions of devices to the internet for communication and computation purposes. Due to constraints such as limited battery power, processing capabilities, and storage capacity, IoT devices often rely on remote fog nodes for task execution, a practice known as task offloading. The NP-hard nature of offloading and scheduling IoT tasks onto fog nodes poses significant challenges. Current IoT task offloading often relies on single parameters like device MIPS, RAM, or battery power. Similarly, task allocation on fog nodes frequently prioritizes VM MIPS. To address energy consumption and task failures in IoT systems, robust fault tolerance, efficient task offloading, and effective scheduling are crucial. This paper introduces a novel Fault-Tolerant, Priority-Based Task Offloading and Scheduling Model (FP-TOSM) for IoT logistics. Utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision-making, IoT tasks are prioritized. Tasks below a specified threshold are executed locally, while those within a defined range are offloaded to a fog node. Tasks exceeding this range are delegated to the cloud. The Euclidean formula is used to determine the proximity between the IoT logistics vehicle and fog nodes for offloading decisions. Dynamic re-clustering fault tolerance mechanisms are utilized to manage task failures after offloading. Successful offloaded tasks are allocated to suitable VMs in the cloud and fog nodes. The proposed strategy selects the most suitable VM for offloaded tasks using a multi-criteria decision-making process to reduce energy consumption, SLA violations, and execution costs. The model's performance is evaluated through simulations in iFogSim2. Results demonstrate reductions in energy consumption by up to 5.8â¯% and 10.4â¯%, decreases in SLA violations by up to 25.2â¯%, and a 16.28â¯% improvement in response time compared to an ACO-based model with a response time of 17.8â¯%. Additionally, the task failure ratio shows a significant reduction of up to 22.1â¯%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of FP-TOSM in enhancing efficiency and reliability within fog computing environments.",

Due to prevalence of IoT devices, even if they are compromised and used in attacks, it is difficult to detect and respond to them. Currently, there has been extensive research on threat modeling for cyberattacks. However, there remains a significant gap in research concerning threat modeling for attacks specially targeting IoT devices within the fifth-generation communication environment. In this paper, we present IoT Targeting-Threat Modeling(I3TM) framework established by analyzing botnets that are appeared before 2021 such as Mirai, Pink etc. Through this framework, we identify tactics and techniques to respond to the attacks. Using the identified tactics and techniques from our proposed framework, we can promptly respond to the newly detected attacks. We constructed a Threat Modeling Framework Keyword-Based Metrics to show extracted keywords from reports, academic papers, and white paper that identifies the features of botnet. We also provide an objective way to apply those keywords to the framework. Our framework is organized to analyze the attack process of botnets that may occur against IoT. The framework derives execution for each tactic for objective analysis based on keywords. In the validation for the framework, I3TM identified eight Tactics from Medusa botnet.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm redefines the term \"network\" by enabling network managers to programmatically initialize, control, alter, and govern network behavior. Network engineers benefit from SDN's ability to rapidly track networks, centrally manage networks, and quickly and effectively detect malicious traffic and connection failure. The attacker will have total control over the system if he is able to access the main controller. The system's resources can be completely exhausted by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults, rendering the controller's services entirely unavailable. The low computational and power capabilities of everyday Internet of Things (IoT) devices render the controller highly susceptible to these attacks; the IoT ecosystem prioritizes functionality over security features, making DDoS attacks a significant problem. This paper conducts a comparative study on the use of machine learning (ML) to mitigate DDoS attack traffic, distinguishing it from benign traffic. This is done to prevent several assaults and to provide mitigation security threats in the network, according to specific requirements. So, the study used machine learning-based techniques to make both traditional and SDN-IoT environments less vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Therefore, the primary goals of the comparative study are to determine which SDN and SDN-IoT platform is better at detecting DDoS attacks and to evaluate how well both platforms work when combined with ML techniques.",

ICN enhances the IoT by utilizing in-network caching regarding data dissemination with the help of various paths labeled by the name of the path by which the data is returned. Caching is a significant technique for improving content accessibility, reducing hops while transferring data, and finally shortening data access time, which in turn improves IoT networks. This study develops a novel caching strategy that caches content in suitable locations at highly requested nodes, thereby improving the information caching efficiency of ICN-based IoT systems. When comparing the proposed caching scheme with other caching methods, it pay attention to the data retrieval latency, cache hit ratio, and the average number of hops. These results consistently show that the proposed strategy enhances cache performance by a high margin. The future context of the utilization of the specified caching strategy will lie in the advancements of fog, edge, and ad hoc networks concerning the concept of IoT and new trends like 5â¯G and 6â¯G.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditional Internet of Things (IoT) architectures that rely on centralized servers for data management and decision-making are vulnerable to security threats and privacy leakage. To address this issue, blockchain has been advocated for decentralized data management in a tamper-resistance, traceable, and transparent manner. However, a major issue that hinders the integration of blockchain and IoT lies in that, it is rather challenging for resource-constrained IoT devices to perform computation-intensive blockchain consensuses such as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Furthermore, the incentive mechanism of PoW pushes lightweight IoT nodes to aggregate their computing power to increase the possibility of successful block generation. Nevertheless, this eventually leads to the formation of computing power alliances, and significantly compromises the decentralization and security of BlockChain-aided IoT (BC-IoT) networks. To cope with these issues, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol for BC-IoT, called Proof-of-Trusted-Work (PoTW). The goal of the proposed consensus is to disincentivize the centralization of computing power and encourage the independent participation of lightweight IoT nodes in blockchain consensus. First, we put forth an on-chain reputation evaluation rule and a reputation chain for PoTW to enable the verifiability and traceability of nodes' reputations based on their contributions of computing power to the blockchain consensus, and we incorporate the multi-level block generation difficulty as a rewards for nodes to accumulate reputations. Second, we model the block generation process of PoTW and analyze the block throughput using the continuous time Markov chain. Additionally, we define and optimize the relative throughput gain to quantify and maximize the capability of PoTW that suppresses the computing power centralization (i.e., centralization suppression). Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the computing power of the computing power alliance and the levels of block generation difficulty on the centralization suppression capability of PoTW. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the consistency of the analytical results in terms of block throughput. In particular, the results show that PoTW effectively reduces the block generation proportion of the computing power alliance compared with PoW, while simultaneously improving that of individual lightweight nodes. This indicates that PoTW is capable of suppressing the centralization of computing power to a certain degree. Moreover, as the levels of block generation difficulty in PoTW increase, its centralization suppression capability strengthens.",

Traditional detection methods, such as ground patrols and satellite imagery, are often ineffective, expensive, and time-consuming. This paper introduces a novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based IoT system for chainsaw noise detection and prevention. The system uses low-cost IoT nodes with microphones and microcontrollers to detect chainsaw sounds via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. These nodes reduce power consumption, allowing the battery to last at least 8 years. Detected chainsaw sounds are transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway and forwarded to a cloud server. The cloud server processes the data and dispatches a drone equipped with a camera to the site. The drone streams live video to the cloud, where AI algorithms analyze the footage for human presence. If detected, the drone activates sound and light alarms to deter illegal logging. Experimental results show that IoT nodes can detect chainsaw sounds up to 100 m, with the CNN model achieving an accuracy of 99.37 % and a loss of 0.0185. Comparisons with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM demonstrated the superior performance of CNN. This UAV-IoT system offers a fast, reliable, scalable, and real-time solution for detecting and preventing illegal logging. Leveraging advanced AI and IoT technologies, this system enhances environmental monitoring and conservation efforts. It represents a significant step forward in the fight against illegal logging, providing a practical, effective, and sustainable solution.",

Specifically, CCMB aims to improve the scalability of securely storing, tracing, and transmitting IoT behavior and reputation data based on our proposed cross-mapped Behavior Chain (BChain) and Reputation Chain (RChain). To improve off-chain IoT data storage scalability, we show that our lightweight CCMB architecture efficiently utilizes available fog-cloud resources. The scalability of on-chain IoT data tracing is enhanced using our Mapping Smart Contract (MSC) and cross-chain mapping design to perform rapid Reputation-to-Behavior (R2B) traceability queries between BChain and RChain blocks. To maximize off-chain to on-chain throughput, we optimize the CCMB block settings and producers based on a general Poisson Point Process (PPP) network model. The constrained optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and solved using a dual-network Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. Simulation results validate CCMB's scalability advantages in storage, traceability, and throughput. In specific massive IoT scenarios, CCMB can reduce the storage footprint by 50% and traceability query time by 90%, while improving system throughput by 55% compared to existing benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to address the urban vehicle parking issues by proposing a solution using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) through image processing and a sensor-based hardware system. Integrating these technologies forms a Smart Parking Management System (SPMS) to automate parking processes and enhance the parking experience. The study aims to create an efficient system that eliminates manual vehicle registration and optimizes space utilization. ANPR and IoT-based sensors help users identify the available slots and pay only for the actual parking duration, which will help to minimize the fixed billing rates. The proposed ANPR system processes vehicle number plates at entry, ensuring seamless identification and eliminating manual registration. IoT sensors monitor real-time slot occupancy, transmitting data to a web admin panel. This panel provides insights such as entry and exit times, total parking duration, and billing costs, facilitating efficient management and remote monitoring. The ANPR-based SPMS reduces reliance on manual processes, streamlining entry procedures. By dynamically assessing slot availability through IoT sensors, users can locate unoccupied spaces quickly, which enhances user convenience. The web admin panel allows administrators to monitor the system remotely, ensuring smooth operations and maintaining accurate records. This study introduces a comprehensive solution to urban parking challenges by integrating ANPR and IoT technologies. The SPMS improves efficiency, reduces human resource needs, and enhances user experience with flexible billing based on actual duration. The combination of hardware and software provides a foundation for effective urban parking management.",

The challenges posed by climate change which involve 1) increased pressure on natural resources, and 2) heightened food safety requirements, eventually call for innovative solutions to protect agricultural resources. Early fire detection, in particular, is essential to prevent major damage and ensure the sustainability of agricultural practices. This article presents an advanced IoT architecture for early fire detection. The proposed architecture integrates 1) smoke and flame sensors, 2) a Raspberry Pi for local processing, and 3) the ThingSpeak platform for data storage and visualization. The system is based on a three-layered architecture: 1) the IoT device layer, 2) the cloud layer, and 3) the application layer, enabling real-time collection and analysis of environmental data. Sensors collect real-time environmental data, which is then transmitted to ThingSpeak for storage. The ThingSpeak platform, combined with MATLAB visualization tools, enables continuous monitoring and in-depth trend analysis of historical data. The results show a clear improvement in accuracy and responsiveness in fire detection while contributing to the safety of agricultural resources and more sustainable management. The blend of IoT technologies, real-time data processing, and cloud-based visualization in this proposed detection system represents an important step towards safer and more resilient agriculture in the face of environmental risks.",

This widespread adoption of IoT has opened a large threat landscape to computer networks, leaving security gaps in IoT-enabled networks. These resource-constrained devices lack sufficient security mechanisms and become the weakest link in our in computer networks and jeopardize systems and data. To address this issue, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed as one of many tools to mitigate IoT related intrusions. While IDS have proven to be a crucial tools for threat detection, their dependence on labeled data and their high computational costs have become obstacles to real life adoption. In this work, we present IoT-PRIDS, a new framework equipped with a host-based anomaly-based intrusion detection system that leverages âpacket representationsâ to understand the typical behavior of devices, focusing on their communications, services, and packet header values. It is a lightweight non-ML model that relies solely on benign network traffic for intrusion detection and offers a practical way for securing IoT environments. Our results show that this model can detect the majority of abnormal flows while keeping false alarms at a minimum and is promising to be used in real-world applications.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (175KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary technology in the field of manufacturing that enables real-time data communication and control of various industrial sensors and devices. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is one of the most popular communication protocols for IoT applications which offers lightweight, efficient, and reliable communication. There are several MQTT client libraries available for implementing MQTT communication for IoT applications. The selection of an appropriate client library can significantly impact the performance of an IoT application. This paper presents a performance evaluation framework for MQTT client libraries for IoT applications in the manufacturing industry. This paper aims to create a standardized virtual testing environment to compare the performance of different MQTT client libraries using various test conditions. It offers a structured and standardized methodology for evaluating performance aspects such as latency, scalability, and resource utilization. By systematically evaluating the performance of MQTT client libraries against these metrics, users can make informed decisions while selecting the most appropriate library for their IoT applications. The framework takes into consideration the unique requirements and constraints of manufacturing applications, such as the need for low-latency communication, secure data exchange, and compatibility with resource-constrained devices. Ultimately, this research contributes to the optimization of IoT applications in the manufacturing industry, facilitating the implementation of efficient, reliable, and scalable data communication.",

The adaptive learning mechanism continuously updates model parameters to counter evolving cyber threats. The framework's performance was evaluated in a simulation environment using the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017 datasets. Results demonstrated that SecEdge outperformed state-of-the-art methods with a detection rate of 98.8% for DoS attacks on NSL-KDD, 98.5% for MitM attacks on UNSW-NB15, and 98.7% for data injection attacks on CICIDS2017.",

With the advent of 6G networks, which promise ultra-fast speeds, vast connectivity, and low-latency communication, MEC-IoT systems are becoming more powerful but also face significant security challenges. Existing authentication mechanisms (AMs) are often vulnerable to attacks like impersonation and insider threats. This paper introduces a novel lightweight AM, called RAM-MEN that employs cryptography and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) to secure IoT-enabled MEC environments in the 6G era. It protects against insider threats and fake MEC access points while ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, the proposed RAM-MEN establishes a secure communication channel (session key) between IoT devices and the MEC server, enabling secure offloading of computationally intensive tasks. The security of the session is rigorously evaluated using formal methods, including Scyther and the random or real model, alongside informal approaches. Comparative performance evaluations show that the proposed RAM-MEN reduces communication costs by 21.54% to 45.53% and computational costs by 17.09% to 83.72%, while providing enhanced security features.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNumerous devices, including sensors, RF ID, and other types of smart devices, have been developed as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. Urban areas can become smart by monitoring and collecting data about their surroundings through the deployment of technologies with powerful computational capabilities and those that are converted into intelligent things. Waste management is among the most significant issues in smart cities, a rise in metropolitan regions and faster increases in population are the main reasons. When it comes to gathering data about waste management, intelligent services can serve as the front line. Waste management with IoT support is a common example of a service offered by smart cities. Various duties, like gathering, processing, and use of waste in appropriate facilities, are included in waste management. The present study proposed an updated waste management system architecture design after reviewing existing artificial intelligence and IoT-based waste management systems and automation in smart cities. The proposed system architecture deals with the automation of municipality trash in smarter urban areas, using IoT technology and sending notification messages based on sensor data relating to the dustbin state, such as full or empty. The notifications are sent simultaneously to the municipality office and the waste carrier vehicle driver, so that waste can be emptied on time. The proposed system architecture represents a scalable and adaptable model for municipalities that aim to transform their waste collection processes and play a key step in minimizing municipality waste in smart cities. By deploying this proposed system architecture with smart sensors and IoT devices, municipalities can monitor waste levels to ensure that bins are emptied when it is necessary. This reduces the frequency of waste collection, lowers fuel consumption, and minimizes operational costs. The Route optimization algorithms further enhance efficiency by determining the most efficient paths for waste collection trucks, so they can reduce travel time and fuel emissions.",

Despite this, the standardization efforts have not yet resulted in widely adopted standards, and the market is fragmented into multiple solutions both at physical and communication protocol levels. Moreover, IoT systems exacerbate the usual test bed limitations, e.g., scalability (very large number of devices), hardware compatibility, space, and price. Due to the above problems, simulation tools become an extremely interesting tool for studying IoT systems both for academia (new algorithms), standardization (new protocols), and industry (what-if analysis). In this paper we will discuss what are the most relevant features and models that a simulation tool like ns-3 should prioritize to enable the above-mentioned needs from academia, standardization, and industry, and if they are achievable in the short, medium, or long term.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (255KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Having diverse and extensive networking and resource-constrained devices creates vulnerabilities to various cyber-attacks. The IoT with the supervision of Software Defined Network (SDN) enhances the network performance through its flexibility and adaptability. Different methods have been employed for detecting security attacks; however, they are often computationally efficient and unsuitable for such resource-constraint environments. Consequently, there is a significant requirement to develop efficient security measures against a range of attacks. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) models have paved the way for designing effective attack detection methods. In this study, we leverage Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a correlation coefficient as a fitness function for feature selection. Additionally, mutual information (MI) is applied for feature ranking to measure their dependency on the target variable. The selected optimal features were used to train a hybrid DNN model to uncover attacks in IoT networks. The hybrid DNN integrates Convolutional Neural Network, Bi-Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for training the input data. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated against several other baseline DL models, and an ablation study is provided. Three key datasets InSDN, UNSW-NB15, and CICIoT 2023 datasets, containing various types of attacks, were used to assess the performance of the model. The proposed model demonstrates an impressive accuracy and detection time over the existing model with lower resource consumption.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (306KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, current methods often fall short in balancing high accuracy with low computational resource requirements, especially in resource-constrained environments. Deep learning has shown significant potential in enhancing computer vision tasks, including human pose estimation. In this study, we propose DESNet, an improved EfficientHRNet model that integrates IoT technology. DESNet combines Dynamic Multi-Scale Context (DMC) modules and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules, and utilizes IoT for real-time data collection, transmission, and processing. Experimental results show that DESNet achieves an average precision (AP) of 74.8% on the COCO dataset and a PCKh (Percentage of Correct Keypoints with head-normalized) of 90.9% on the MPII dataset, outperforming existing lightweight models. The integration of deep learning and IoT technology not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of human pose estimation but also significantly enhances the timeliness and robustness of feedback in sports training applications. Our findings demonstrate that DESNet is a powerful tool for real-time human pose analysis, offering promising solutions for intelligent sports training and rehabilitation systems.",

IoT devices are linked to cloud-based services offering storage, calculating, and analytics abilities. However, these devices are also exposed to malware attacks that could cause significant damage. Malware detection in IoT cloud platforms involves analyzing and identifying potential threats like Trojans, viruses, ransomware, and worms. It is done through several processes, including behavior-based detection, signature-based detection, and anomaly-based detection. The study proposes a Chaos Game Optimization with improved deep learning for Malware Detection (CGOIDL-MD) technique in the IoT cloud platform. The proposed CGOIDL-MD technique majorly concentrates on the automated detection and classification of malware in the IoT cloud framework. The CGOIDL-MD method applies the CGO-based feature subset selection (CGO-FSS) approach to select features. Besides, the stacked long short-term memory sequence-to-sequence autoencoder (SLSTM-SSAE) approach was exploited for malware classification and detection. Moreover, the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) technique was exploited for the hyperparameter selection technique. The simulation outcomes of the CGOIDL-MD technique were tested on the malware dataset, and the outcome can be studied from different perspectives. The experimentation outcomes illustrate the betterment of the CGOIDL-MD technique under various measures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, automated medical image analysis has become essential for real-time disease detection. However, current models face limitations in handling diverse datasets and ensuring privacy across distributed systems. To address these challenges, we propose the AFM-DViT model, which integrates adaptive federated learning with Vision Transformer, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in IoT-based settings. Our framework not only improves detection capabilities but also effectively addresses critical issues related to data privacy and heterogeneity in medical imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that AFM-DViT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving an AUROC of 0.841 and sensitivity of 0.925 on the ChestX-ray14 dataset, alongside a sensitivity of 0.888 with an AUC of 0.905 on the LUNA16 dataset. These results highlight the modelâs robust detection accuracy while maintaining data privacy. The AFM-DViT model offers an effective solution for secure and efficient medical image analysis in IoT-enabled environments.",

In several paradigms of IoT applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites for IoT have concerned much attention and are experiencing quick progress. As for UAVs, because of their superiority in maneuverability and cost, it is established an increasingly extensive consumption in several IoT scenarios like disaster relief, rapid transportation, and environment monitoring. Security remains a main problem in the IoT supported UAV networks that are solved by the employ of intrusion detection system (IDS) methods.\nObjective\nThis article aims to present a Tasmanian Devil Optimization with Deep Autoencoder for Intrusion Detection System (TDODAE-IDS) technique in IoT assisted Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks.\nMethods\nThe presented TDODAE-IDS technique majorly concentrates on the effectual identification of the intrusions in the IoT based UAV networks. To accomplish this, the presented TDODAE-IDS system designs a new TDO algorithm for the feature subset selection process. Moreover, the DAE model classifies the existence of intrusion in the UAV network and the hyperparameter tuning of the DAE model takes place using the dragonfly algorithm (DFA).\nResults\nThe simulation results of the TDODAE-IDS approach were tested on a benchmark IDS dataset and the results are assessed under several measures.\nConclusion\nThe comprehensive comparative analysis highlighted the enhanced outcomes of the TDODAE-IDS algorithm over other recent approaches with maximum accuracy of 99.36%. Therefore, the proposed model can be employed to accomplish security in the IoT assisted UAV networks.",

When it comes to the evolution of intelligent green energy systems, Internet of Things (IoT)-based green-smart photovoltaic (PV) systems have been brought into the spotlight owing to their cutting- edge sensing and data-processing technologies. This review is focused on three critical segments of IoT-based green-smart PV systems. First, the climatic parameters and sensing technologies for IoT-based PV systems under extreme weather conditions are presented. Second, the methods for processing data from smart sensors are discussed, in order to realize health monitoring of PV systems under extreme environmental conditions. Third, the smart materials applied to sensors and the insulation materials used in PV backsheets are susceptible to aging, and these materials and their aging phenomena are highlighted in this review. This review also offers new perspectives for optimizing the current international standards for green energy systems using big data from IoT-based smart sensors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSecuring Internet of Things (IoT) devices is paramount to mitigate unauthorised access and potential cyber threats, safeguarding the integrity of transmitted and processed data within interconnected devices. Identifying malicious IoT devices necessitates vigilant monitoring of network traffic, behaviour analysis, and implementing security measures, including Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), and regular firmware updates. Traditional security approaches need to be revised for safeguarding IoT systems due to their inherent limitations in accommodating the resource-constrained nature of these devices.\nWe introduce IoTPredictor, an advanced security approach designed to predict and detect malicious activities in IoT devices. Leveraging Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), IoTPredictor integrates an ADS to proactively detect and thwart attacks within the complex IoT-fog computing landscape. Our conceptual approach begins with categorising IoT devices into genuine, compromised, and counterfeit. We propose an HMM-based state transition model that captures potential transitions between states, such as normal, compromised, or counterfeit operations. We introduce an algorithm for estimating probabilities associated with next-state predictions to facilitate predictive analysis. Furthermore, we present a formal approach for analysing communications between different states, enhancing the precision of the security framework. To validate the effectiveness of IoTPredictor, we conduct a series of experiments and provide a comprehensive evaluation. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our proposed security framework in predicting and preventing malicious activities, thereby contributing to the overall security enhancement of IoT devices within the complex IoT-fog computing network.",

To address this need, this study offers an overview of components and services tailored to address specific quality attributes pertinent to agriculture systems. It identifies, investigates, and presents quality attributes influencing the design of software architecture for IoT-based agriculture systems. This paper identified and discussed several quality attributes, including performance, scalability, flexibility, interoperability, productivity, extensibility, and security, and mapped them to corresponding components of the IoT-based agriculture software architecture. Also, several issues were identified and discussed for the software architecture quality of IoT-based agriculture systems, such as real-time processing and interoperability due to the various devices and protocols utilized in these systems. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for developing, executing, and refining IoT-based agricultural systems to fulfill the changing requirements of the agriculture industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn an era of resource scarcity and environmental concerns, integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology into the circular economy (CE), particularly for household appliances like microwaves, is crucial. The lack of systematic assessment of their post-use residual values often reduces utilization and shortens lifespans. Inadequate disposal and management contribute to electronic waste and environmental pollution. Addressing these challenges is vital for efficient appliance management within resource constraints, ensuring meaningful contributions to sustainable resource management. Thus, this study addresses these concerns by integrating IoT technology into microwave ovens, enabling real-time monitoring of key parameters such as voltage, current, door closures, and motor/blade rotations. Data from integrated sensors enables performance analysis and trend tracking, offering potential for advancing CE practices and sustainable product management. Subsequently, utilizing the insights stored from IoT data analysis and tailored surveys, a predictive maintenance model is developed, aiming to predict the life cycles of microwave oven components and categorize them within the CE principles, including reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and cascade. Finally, to mitigate the challenges of lower effective utilization and shortened operating lifespans observed in household appliances, this research employs machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree to accurately predict the residual values of IoT-enabled microwaves. Notably, Random Forest demonstrates superior accuracy compared to the other models. Therefore, these technological advancements allow household appliances to be utilized more effectively, thereby enhancing resource utilization.",

This transformation is not limited to technological changes. It also affects the actors and activities that characterize markets. We argue that the possibility of forms of exclusion / inclusion, as interpreted in Luhmann's theory, has important consequences for IoT solutions. Different from prior studies which have focused on why and how market-related forces exclude actors from a market, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of possible exclusion phenomena linked to IoT implementation in business markets, concerning its affected actors, mechanisms, and consequences. Using âcold casesâ, this research uses case study methodology to identify potential forms of exclusion and inclusion. It then develops a framework that identifies different situations of exclusion and inclusion.

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has brought numerous benefits to the interconnected world. However, the ubiquitous nature of IoT networks exposes them to various security threats, including anomaly intrusion attacks. In addition, IoT devices generate a high volume of unstructured data. Traditional intrusion detection systems often struggle to cope with the unique characteristics of IoT networks, such as resource constraints and heterogeneous data sources. Given the unpredictable nature of network technologies and diverse intrusion methods, conventional machine-learning approaches seem to lack efficiency. Across numerous research domains, deep learning techniques have demonstrated their capability to precisely detect anomalies. This study designs and enhances a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection system (AIDS) for IoT networks. Firstly, a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) is applied to reduce the high dimension and get a significant data representation by calculating the reconstructed error. Secondly, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique is employed to create a binary classification approach. The proposed SAE-CNN approach is validated using the Bot-IoT dataset. The proposed models exceed the performance of the existing deep learning approach in the literature with an accuracy of 99.9%, precision of 99.9%, recall of 100%, F1 of 99.9%, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.0003, and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.9992. In addition, alternative metrics, such as training and testing durations, indicated that SAE-CNN performs better.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe agriculture industry is currently facing significant challenges in effectively monitoring the health of livestock. Traditional methods of health monitoring are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and insufficiently responsive to the needs of modern farming. As the number of IoT devices in agriculture proliferates, issues of scalability and computational load have become prominent, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions. This research introduces a cloud-based architecture aimed at enhancing livestock health monitoring. This system is designed to track critical health indicators such as movement patterns, body temperature, and heart rate, utilizing AWS for robust data handling and Python for data processing and real-time analytics. The proposed system incorporates Narrow Band IoT (Nb IoT) technology, which is optimized for low-bandwidth, long-range communication, making it suitable for rural and remote farming locations. The architecture's scalability allows for the effective management of varying numbers of IoT devices, which is essential for adapting to changing herd sizes and farm scales. Preliminary experiments conducted to assess the system's performance have demonstrated its durability and effectiveness, indicating a successful integration of AWS IoT Cloud services with the deployed IoT devices. Furthermore, the study explores the implementation of predictive analytics to facilitate proactive health management in livestock. By predicting potential health issues before they become apparent, the system can offer significant improvements in animal welfare and farm efficiency. The integration of cloud computing and IoT not only meets the growing technological needs of modern agriculture but also sets a new benchmark in the development of sustainable farming practices. The findings from this research could have broad implications for the future of livestock management, potentially leading to widespread adoption of technology-driven health monitoring systems in agriculture. This would help in optimizing the health management of livestock globally, thereby enhancing productivity and sustainability in the agricultural sector.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm which facilitates the seamless integration of physical devices and digital systems, thereby transforming multiple sectors such as healthcare, transportation, and urban planning. This paradigm is also known as ad-hoc networks. IoT is characterized by several pieces of equipment called objects. These objects have different and limited capacities such as battery, memory, and computing power. These limited capabilities make it difficult to design routing protocols for IoT networks because of the high number of objects in a network. In IoT, objects often have data which does not belong to them and which should be sent to other objects, then leading to a problem known as permutation routing problems. The solution to that problem is found when each object receives its items. In this paper, we propose a new approach to addressing the permutation routing problem in single-hop IoT networks. To this end, we start by representing an IoT network as an oriented graph, and then, based on a reservation channel protocol, we first define a permutation routing protocol for an IoT in a single channel. Secondly, we generalize the previous protocol to make it work in multiple channels. Routing is done using graph theory approaches. The obtained results show that the wake-up times and activities of IoT objects are greatly reduced, thus optimizing network lifetime. This is an effective solution for the permutation routing problem in IoT networks. The proposed approach considerably reduces energy consumption and computation time. It saves 5.2 to 32.04% residual energy depending on the number of items and channels used. Low energy and low computational cost demonstrate that the performance of circuit-based and oriented graph theory is better than the state-of-the-art protocol and therefore is a better candidate for the resolution of the permutation routing problem in single-hop environment.",

However, the proliferation of IoT devices has also raised significant security and privacy concerns. Traditional security measures often fail to address these concerns due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and resource constraints. This survey paper adopts a thematic exploration approach for a comprehensive analysis to investigate the convergence of quantum computing, federated learning, and 6G wireless networks. This novel intersection is explored to significantly improve security and privacy within the IoT ecosystem. Quantum computing can enhance encryption algorithms to make IoT data more secure for intelligent IoT applications. Federated learning, a decentralized machine learning approach, allows IoT devices to learn a shared model while keeping all the training data on the original device, thereby enhancing privacy. This synergy becomes even more crucial when integrated with the high-speed, low-latency capabilities of 6G networks, which can facilitate real-time, secure data processing and communication among many IoT devices. Second, we discuss the latest developments, offering an up-to-date overview of advanced solutions, available datasets, and key performance metrics and summarizing the vital insights, challenges, and trends in securing IoT systems. Third, we design a conceptual framework for integrating quantum computing in federated learning, adapted for 6G networks. Finally, we highlight the future advancements in quantum technologies and 6G networks and summarize the implications for IoT security, paving the way for researchers and practitioners in the field of IoT security.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) is an ecosystem of interconnected devices (IoT devices) that is capable of intelligent decision making. IoT devices can include everyday objects such as televisions, cars and shoes. The interconnectedness brought forth by IoT has extended the need for cybersecurity beyond the information security realm into the physical security sphere. However, ensuring cybersecurity of IoT devices is far from straightforward because IoT devices have several cybersecurity challenges associated with them. Some of the pertinent cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in this regard relate to: (i) Security During Manufacturing, (ii) Identification and Authentication, (iii) Lack of Encryption, (iv) Large Attack Surface, (v) Security During Updates, (vi) Lack of User Awareness and (vii) Diverging Standards and Regulations.\nAgainst this background, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) has been proposed to complement the existing EU cybersecurity framework consisting of legislations such as the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS2 Directive. However, does the CRA provide a framework for effectively combating the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices in the EU? The central crux of the CRA is to lay down and enforce the rules required to ensure cybersecurity of âproducts with digital elementsâ, which includes IoT devices. To this end, several obligations are imposed on manufacturers, importers and distributors of IoT devices. Manufacturers are mandated to ensure that the essential cybersecurity requirements prescribed by the CRA are met before placing IoT devices in the market. While the cybersecurity requirements mandated by the CRA are commendable, the CRA suffers from several ambiguities which can hamper its potential impact. For instance, the CRA could provide guidance to manufacturers on how to conduct cybersecurity risk assessment and could clarify the meanings of terms such as âlimit attack surfacesâ and âwithout any known exploitable vulnerabilitiesâ.\nWhen the fundamental themes of the CRA is analysed from the prism of the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices, it becomes clear that the CRA does provide a foundation for effectively addressing the cybersecurity challenges of IoT devices. However, the expansive wording in various parts of the CRA, including in the Annex I Requirements, leaves scope for interpretation on several fronts. Consequently, the effectiveness of the CRA in tackling the Security During Manufacturing Challenge, Identification and Authentication Challenge, Large Attack Surface Challenge and Diverging Standards and Regulations Challenge would be largely contingent on how harmonised standards develop and how the industry adopts them. The CRA seems to be more effective, albeit not fully so, in significantly addressing the Lack of Encryption Challenge, Security During Updates Challenge and Lack of User Awareness Challenge of IoT devices. However, the manner in which the CRA addresses all these cybersecurity challenges could be improved upon if an agency such as the ENISA was given the legal mandate to set elaborate standards for cybersecurity requirements under the CRA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has posed a new challenge for forensic investigators, who find themselves carrying out examinations in a very heterogeneous and novel scenario. Aspects such as the high number of devices, the unlikelihood of having physical access to them, the short lifetime of the data, or the difficulty of acquiring it, demand changes in some of the key processes of forensic investigations. In this regard, the identification, acquisition, and analysis phases call for an IoT-centred approach that can fulfil the requirements of the environment. Due to the interoperability of the IoT, and the way in which the data is handled and exchanged, the network traffic becomes a very useful source of evidence. In view of this, this paper presents an automatic procedure for identifying, analysing, and acquiring IoT network traffic and using it as a basis for forensic examinations by employing an edge node capable of performing real-time traffic monitoring and analysis on the most popular IoT protocols. Furthermore, by pairing it with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the proposal is capable of following a proactive approach, detecting threats and taking the corresponding measures to assure the correct initiation of a forensic process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomated guided vehicle (AGV), which was initially designed for indoor operations in industry, has been increasingly applied in outdoor heavy-duty logistics tasks. In typical navigation tasks, such as the autonomous tracking of a designated object or a person, relative angle and relative distance between AGV and the target is required. To obtain the necessary information, various on-board sensors are extensively integrated. In this paper, the reliability of measuring the relative angle with the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) method with two different Internet of Things (IoT) sensor sets from Texas Instrument (TI) and u-blox, according to Bluetooth 5.1 was investigated. The performance of IoT sensors was validated with angle accuracy parameters and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The better IoT sensor was then integrated into the AGV navigation system, and the information gathered from IoT sensor enabled the AGV to turn toward the direction of the target. The process of AGV turning to the targeted direction based on IoT sensor information was respectively tested in the simulation and actual environment and evaluated by the disparity between the real relative angle and the rotation angle of the AGV. The results showed that this disparity was within Â±5Â° in both simulated and actual environments, and methods for higher accuracy were proposed. In this way, the reliability and performance of Angle of Arrival (AoA) sensors in measuring the relative angle, which remains unexplored by other researchers, was systematically assessed contributing to extending the usability of AoA sensors in complex, real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced a new phase of connectivity in recent years and, concurrently, has opened the floodgates for growing cyber threats. Among the myriad of potential attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a dominant concern due to their capability to render services inoperable by overwhelming systems with an influx of traffic. As IoT devices often lack the inherent security measures found in more mature computing platforms, the need for robust DoS/DDoS detection systems tailored to IoT is paramount for the sustainable development of every domain that IoT serves. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of three machine learning (ML) algorithms: extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF), for the detection of IoT-targeted DoS/DDoS attacks and three feature engineering methods that have not been used in the existing state-of-the-art, and then employed the best performing algorithm to design a prototype of a novel real-time system towards detection of such DoS/DDoS attacks. The CICIoT2023 dataset was derived from the latest real-world IoT traffic, incorporates both benign and malicious network traffic patterns and after data preprocessing and feature engineering, the data was fed into our models for both training and validation, where findings suggest that while all three models exhibit commendable accuracy in detecting DoS/DDoS attacks, the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection has made great improvements in the performance (accuracy, precsion recall and F1-score of 99.93% for XGB) of the ML models and their execution time (491.023 sceonds for XGB) compared to recursive feature elimination (RFE) and random forest feature importance (RFI) methods. The proposed real-time system for DoS/DDoS attack detection entails the implementation of an platform capable of effectively processing and analyzing network traffic in real-time. This involves employing the best-performing ML algorithm for detection and the integration of warning mechanisms. We believe this approach will significantly enhance the field of security research and continue to refine it based on future insights and developments.",

However, existing methods often face challenges in efficiency and accuracy when processing multimodal data. This study aims to propose an IoT-supported multimodal music emotion recognition model that integrates audio and video signals to achieve real-time emotion recognition and classification. The proposed CGF-Net model combines a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Fully Connected Network (FCN). By effectively fusing multimodal data, the model enhances the accuracy and efficiency of music emotion recognition. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public datasets, DEAM and DEAP, and the results demonstrate that CGF-Net performs exceptionally well in various emotion recognition tasks, particularly achieving high accuracy and F1 scores in recognizing positive emotions such as âHappyâ and âRelax.â Compared to other benchmark models, CGF-Net shows significant advantages in both accuracy and stability. This study presents an effective solution for multimodal emotion recognition, demonstrating its broad potential in applications such as intelligent emotional interaction and music recommendation systems.",

        "abstract": "Summary\nIrrigation drives water consumption in agriculture, essential for crop productivity and conserving water resources. Smart irrigation optimizes water usage, enhances yields, and supports sustainability. Integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) shows potential for reducing water consumption, but hardware, software, and connectivity solutions are still developing. Low-Power Wide-Area Access (LPWA) technologies enable energy-efficient IoT applications with long-range communication. LoRaWAN ensures secure data transmission up to 15 km using a single gateway. This paper presents a LoRaWAN-based prototype irrigation platform developed within the AREThOU5A framework, implemented in a 22-hectare olive grove with Kalamon olives in Greece. The system monitors soil moisture levels using IoT end nodes with low-cost microcontrollers and embedded sensors. Each node measures moisture at depths of 30 cm, 60 cm, and 90 cm, operating on battery power for months and communicating via LoRaWAN. Data is transmitted through a LoRaWAN gateway to a cloud-based infrastructure using 4G connectivity, allowing real-time access via online dashboards. Collected data will inform smart irrigation strategies, maximizing water savings and ensuring reliable connectivity. A robust software development system has integrated IoT subsystems for olive grove management, centralizing measurement data in a web-accessible database. This enables real-time monitoring, trend analysis, and cultivation optimization. The system is hosted on a public cloud platform, using Docker for flexible deployment and data management. In the olive grove in Peta, a specialized InfluxDB routine optimizes water use, operating effectively for two years. An annual dashboard highlights key data points, including soil moisture, temperature readings, and health diagnostics. Water consumption was reduced by 42 % in 2020 and 25 % in 2021. An identification application secures user data management and supports sustainability.",

This work aimed to assess the effectiveness of a newly developed IoT system in promoting behavioural changes and improving IAQ in 84 homes of families with children. To accomplish this aim, a modular IoT architecture using calibrated LCS was developed to collect real-time data on CO2, temperature, relative humidity and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) during a randomised cross-over trial (November 16, 2022âJanuary 24, 2023). The intervention under study consisted of providing access to real-time IAQ data to participants and alerting them via a smartphone app when CO2, PM2.5, and/or PM10 concentrations were higher than the recommended limits. The findings showed that LCS readings were strongly correlated with those obtained from reference equipment. Nevertheless, long-term assessments revealed a signal degradation effect for the readings obtained from the LCS PM sensor. The comparison of IAQ data from control and intervention periods showed a significant alleviation of CO2 concentrations (mean reduction of 10.3 % in 52 out of 84 participant homes). Notably, about 70 % of participants recognized that data presented through the app motivated them to take valuable actions to enhance IAQ. Overall, this study constitutes a step forward to provide valuable field evidence on the strengths and limitations of using IoT systems based on LCS to empower citizens on the factors that may influence exposure to air pollution at home.",

These IoT applications, while promising significant enhancements in patient care and health outcomes, simultaneously present a myriad of ethical dilemmas. This paper aims to address these ethical challenges by introducing the Adaptive Ethical Framework for IoT in Digital Health (AEFIDH), a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to examine the ethical implications of IoT technologies within digital health contexts. The AEFIDH is developed using a mixed-methods approach, encompassing expert consultations, surveys, and interviews. This approach was employed to validate and refine the AEFIDH, ensuring it encapsulates critical ethical dimensions, including data privacy, informed consent, user autonomy, algorithmic fairness, regulatory compliance, ethical design, and equitable access to healthcare services. The research reveals pressing issues related to data privacy, security, and user autonomy and highlights the imperative need for an increased focus on algorithmic transparency and the integration of ethical considerations in the design and development of IoT applications. Despite certain limitations, the AEFIDH provides a promising roadmap for guiding the responsible development, deployment, and utilization of IoT technologies in digital health, ensuring its relevance amidst the rapidly evolving digital health landscape. This paper contributes a novel, dynamic framework that encapsulates current ethical considerations and is designed to adapt to future technological evolutions, thereby fostering ethical resilience in the face of ongoing digital health innovation. The frameworkâs inherent adaptability allows it to evolve in tandem with technological advancements, positioning it as an invaluable tool for stakeholders navigating the ethical terrain of IoT in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Global food security is a pressing issue that affects the stability and well-being of communities worldwide. While existing Internet of Things (IoT) enabled plant monitoring systems have made significant strides in agricultural monitoring, they often face limitations such as high power consumption, restricted mobility, complex deployment requirements, and inadequate security measures for data access. This paper introduces an enhanced IoT application for agricultural monitoring systems that address these critical shortcomings. Our system strategically combines power efficiency, portability, and secure access capabilities, assisting farmers in monitoring and tracking crop environmental conditions. The proposed system includes a remote camera that captures images of surrounding plants and a sensor module that regularly monitors various environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. We implement power management strategies to minimize energy consumption compared to existing solutions. Unlike conventional systems, our implementation utilizes the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform for reliable data storage and processing while incorporating comprehensive security measures, including Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT), features often overlooked in current agricultural IoT solutions. Users can access this secure monitoring system via a developed Android application, providing convenient mobile access to the gathered plant data. We validate our systemâs advantages by implementing it with two potted garlic plants on Okayama Universityâs rooftop. Our evaluation demonstrates high sensor reliability, with strong correlations between sensor readings and reference data, achieving determination coefficients (\n) of 0.979 for temperature and 0.750 for humidity measurements. The implemented power management strategies extend battery life to 10 days on a single charge, significantly outperforming existing systems that typically require daily recharging. Furthermore, our dual-layer security implementation utilizing 2FA and JWT successfully protects sensitive agricultural data from unauthorized access.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTiny Machine Learning is rapidly evolving in edge computing and intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This paper investigates model compression techniques with the aim of determining their compatibility when combined, and identifying an effective approach to improve inference speed and energy efficiency within IoT edge devices. The study is carried out on the application scenario of Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which involves complex signal processing and needs real-time processing and energy efficiency. Therefore, a customized 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) HGR classification model has been designed. An approach based on strategically combining model compression techniques was then implemented resulting in a model customized for faster inference and improved energy efficiency for IoT embedded devices. The model size became compact at 10.42 kB, resulting in a substantial size reduction of 98.8%, and an inference gain of 94.73% on a personal computer with approximately 8.56% decrease in accuracy. The approach of combinative model compression techniques was applied to a wide range of edge-computing IoT devices with limited processing power, resulting in a significant improvement in model execution speed and energy efficiency for these devices. Specifically, there was an average power consumption gain of 52% for Arduino Nano BLE and 34.05% for Raspberry Pi 4. Inference time was halved for Arduino Nano BLE Sense, Nicla Sense, and Raspberry Pi 4, with a remarkable gain of 94% for ESP32.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntegrating IoT technology into basketball action recognition enhances sports analytics, providing crucial insights into player performance and game strategy. However, existing methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex, real-time environments where player movements are frequently occluded or involve intricate interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose the EITNet model, a deep learning framework that combines EfficientDet for object detection, I3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and TimeSformer for temporal analysis, all integrated with IoT technology for seamless real-time data collection and processing. Our contributions include developing a robust architecture that improves recognition accuracy to 92%, surpassing the baseline EfficientDet modelâs 87%, and reducing loss to below 5.0 compared to EfficientDetâs 9.0 over 50 epochs. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technology enhances real-time data processing, providing adaptive insights into player performance and strategy. The paper details the design and implementation of EITNet, experimental validation, and a comprehensive evaluation against existing models. The results demonstrate EITNetâs potential to significantly advance automated sports analysis and optimize data utilization for player performance and strategy improvement.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network system that connects physical devices through the Internet, allowing them to interact. Nowadays, IoT has become an integral part of our lives, offering convenience and smart functionality. However, the growing number of IoT devices has brought about a corresponding increase in cybersecurity threats, such as device vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and network susceptibilities. Integrating blockchain technology with IoT has proven to be a promising approach to enhance IoT security. Nevertheless, the emergence of quantum computing poses a significant challenge to the security of traditional classical cryptography used in blockchain, potentially exposing it to quantum cyber-attacks. To support the growth of the IoT industry, mitigate quantum threats, and safeguard IoT data, this study proposes a robust blockchain solution for IoT that incorporates both classical and post-quantum security measures. Firstly, we present the Quantum-Enhanced Blockchain Architecture for IoT (QBIoT) to ensure secure data sharing and integrity protection. Secondly, we propose an improved Proof of Authority consensus algorithm called âProof of Authority with Random Electionâ (PoARE), implemented within QBIoT for leader selection and new block creation. Thirdly, we develop a public-key quantum signature protocol for transaction verification in the blockchain. Finally, a comprehensive security analysis of QBIoT demonstrates its resilience against cyber threats from both classical and quantum adversaries. In summary, this research introduces an innovative quantum-enhanced blockchain solution to address quantum security concerns within the realm of IoT. The proposed QBIoT framework contributes to the ongoing development of quantum blockchain technology and offers valuable insights for future research on IoT security.",

This critical situation encouraged the deployment of lightweight encryption solutions to avoid additional attacks.

In this research, we provide a novel IoT framework that uses lightweight cryptographic ciphers and the Autonomic Computing paradigm to self-manage the security of IoT devices.

However, the challenges of resource allocation and task offloading in such networks are intricate due to the unique characteristics of satellite communication systems. This researchâs findings enrich the landscape of energy-efficient and dependable satellite-assisted IoT networks. The paper navigates the delicate balance between energy efficiency, network throughput, and fairness in distributing resources among IoT devices. The proposed techniques, notably the Outer Approximation Algorithm (OAA), usher in seamless connectivity and resource optimization. The central challenge at hand, a concave fractional programming problem, transforms through the CharnesâCooper transformation, presenting as a concave optimization enigma. Herein, the proposed outer approximation algorithm takes flight, navigating the intricate paths of concave optimization. The performance of the epsilon-optimal solution faces scrutiny under diverse system parametersâthe constellation of IoT devices, their affiliations, fairness considerations, and the equitable distribution of resource blocks. This contribution not only enriches research but also opens doors to the boundless possibilities of satellite-assisted IoT networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe accuracy and reliability of IoT-based sensor networks depend on validating sensed data, including detecting outliers at the node level. This study proposes an online outlier detection approach using Multiple Linear Regression-based adaptive thresholds for real-time IoT/WSN sensor nodes. IoT sensors experience two outlier types: Errors, from sensor malfunctions or low battery, and Events, from sudden environmental changes. The Adaptive Threshold Based Outlier Detection (ATBOD) approach differentiates errors from events using an adaptive threshold that adjusts to real-time data patterns. Unlike existing methods that are used in literature, which lack automated model evolution and suffer from delays and high computational time, ATBOD enhances outlier detection sensitivity without increasing false alarms, which is crucial for efficient IoT sensor board operation. It also improves sensor board lifespan by discarding errors at the node level, preventing energy wastage from transmitting error data to the cloud. ATBOD outperforms existing algorithms, which are referenced for comparison, such as Enhanced Efficient Outlier Detection and Classification Approach (EEODCA), K Nearest Neighbor approximate outlier detection (KNN), and Modified Local Outlier Factor (LOF), in Error Detection Rate, Error False Positive Rate, and Energy Saving Ratio. These advancements represent a significant leap in performance, making ATBOD a superior method for real-time outlier detection in IoT sensor networks.",

This paper presents the SecureIoT-FL framework, an innovative integration of federated learning and multi-sensor fusion for real-time, privacy-preserving prediction of environmental pollutants in industrial settings. A normalized Federated Averaging (N-FedAvg) as an enhanced version of the conventional FedAvg algorithm, is introduced for global model aggregation to balance the contributions from all clients with varying data volumes, thus stabilizing the learning process. This study contributes a scalable and secure solution for environmental monitoring and risk management in industrial IoT applications. The framework leverages IoT nodes equipped with Raspberry Pi 5 and sensors to detect pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO2, VOCs, CHâO, CO, Oâ, NOâ, HâS, O2, CHâ, SOâ) across three distinct environments: a PCBA factory, a CNC machining factory, and a plastic injection factory. Over five months, the system collected over 516,000 data points, enabling a multi-source data fusion approach to enhance predictive accuracy. The key outcomes of the proposed work include significant improvements in the model performance over 10 biweekly training rounds, with increasing the accuracy from 70â¯% to 92â¯% and 68â89â¯% for LSTM and CNN models, respectively. The framework effectively predicts the pollutant concentrations over multiple timeframes (10, 30, and 60â¯minutes), supporting timely interventions to reduce worker exposure to harmful pollutants. The SecureIoT-FL framework employs federated learning with TLS encryption, ensuring data privacy while supporting secure local model training and weight sharing via MQTT over AWS.",

However, transmitting electricity from these remote locations to the onshore grid necessitates evaluating transmission technologies. While High-Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) systems are commonly used, they are often inadequate for the long-distance needs of OWFs. High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems, on the other hand, offer advantages such as reduced transmission losses, cost efficiency, and better compatibility with offshore infrastructure. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of HVAC and HVDC systems, focusing on transmission efficiency, cost, scalability, and grid stability, and addresses challenges like HVDC stability, exploring configurations to mitigate these issues. Additionally, the paper examines the integration of energy storage systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) with OWFs. It investigates how energy storage can balance supply and demand and enhance grid reliability, while IoT technologies are assessed for their role in optimizing wind farm operations, real-time data management, and control system responsiveness. The study concludes that HVDC systems offer notable benefits over HVAC systems for offshore wind farms, particularly in efficiency and cost. Furthermore, integrating energy storage and IoT technologies is essential for improving grid stability and operational efficiency, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in enhancing offshore wind farm integration into the energy grid.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has recently gained significance as a means of connecting various physical devices to the Internet, enabling various innovative applications. However, the security of IoT networks is a significant concern due to the large volume of data generated and transmitted over them. The limited resources of IoT devices, along with their mobility and diverse characteristics, pose significant challenges for maintaining security in routing protocols, such as the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). This lacks effective defense mechanisms against routing attacks, including Sybil and rank attacks. Various techniques have been proposed to address this issue, including cryptography and intrusion-detection systems. The use of these techniques on IoT nodes is limited by their low power and lossy nature, primarily due to the significant computational overhead they involve. In addition, conventional trust-management systems for addressing security concerns need to be improved due to their high computation, memory, and energy costs. Therefore, this paper presents a novel, Lightweight, and Efficient Trust-based Mechanism (LETM-IoT) for resource-limited IoT networks to mitigate Sybil attacks. We conducted extensive simulations in Cooja, the Contiki OS simulator, to assess the efficacy of the proposed LETM-IoT against three types of Sybil attack (A, B, and C). A comparison was also made with standard RPL and state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental findings show that LETM-IoT outperforms both of these in terms of average packet-delivery ratio by 0.20 percentage points, true-positive ratio by 1.34 percentage points, energy consumption by 2.5%, and memory utilization by 19.42%. The obtained results also show that LETM-IoT consumes increased storage by 5.02% compared to the standard RPL due to the existence of an embedded security module.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its rapid expansion, cloud computing has become integral to various smart healthcare applications. However, the proliferation of digital health services raises significant concerns regarding security and data privacy, making the protection of sensitive medical information paramount. To effectively tackle these challenges, it is crucial to establish resilient network infrastructure and data storage systems capable of defending against malicious entities and permitting access exclusively to authorized users. This requires the deployment of a robust authentication mechanism, wherein medical IoT devices, users (such as doctors or nurses), and servers undergo registration with a trusted authority. The process entails users retrieving data from the cloud server, while IoT devices collect patient data. Before granting access to data retrieval or storage, the cloud server verifies the authenticity of both the user and the IoT device, ensuring secure and authorized interactions within the system. With millions of interconnected smart medical IoT devices autonomously gathering and analyzing vital patient data, the importance of robust security measures becomes increasingly evident. Standard security protocols are fundamental in fortifying smart healthcare applications against potential threats. To confront these issues, this paper introduces a secure and resource-efficient cloud-enabled authentication mechanism. Through empirical analysis, it is demonstrated that our authentication mechanism effectively reduces computational and communication overheads, thereby improving overall system efficiency. Furthermore, both informal and formal analyses affirm the mechanism's resilience against potential cyberattacks, highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding smart healthcare applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nClimate change has had a negative impact on Andean glaciers, especially on the snow-capped Huascaran in Peru, which has experienced a loss of 42 % of its glacier mass. Lack of access to accurate snowpack data complicates understanding and informed decision-making in mountainous environments. To address this problem, an application has been developed based on an AR-IoT architecture that integrates augmented reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) for the periodic monitoring of snow cover on the Huascaran snow-capped mountain. This application uses data collected from meteorological repositories and simulates IoT interactions, while a mobile app offers an interactive and understandable visualization of the data. The Scrum methodology was applied iteratively, from the creation of the 3D model to the connection with the Ubidots platform to store and share the data. The analysis of 58 readings, obtained between April and May 2023, showed correlations between variables such as snow depth, temperature, and wind speed, which served to validate the operation of the AR-IoT technology implemented. These variables offer an initial understanding of atmospheric conditions in high mountains. In addition, the technology developed has the potential to expand to include more relevant data in future analyses. The tool demonstrates the effectiveness of combining these technologies for monitoring high mountain snow cover and making informed decisions about water resources management.",

Yet, it brings notable security and privacy challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environment. We propose a secure and efficient three-factor lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement scheme, designed for IoT-based smart healthcare systems, addressing these critical concerns. The scheme employs a fuzzy extractor, a one-way hash function, Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm and XOR operations for efficient cryptographic transformations, creating a robust framework for secure data handling. The scheme's design focuses on security and privacy while minimizing computational demands, making it ideal for resource-constrained IoT devices. We utilized both informal and formal security analyses to validate our scheme, employing the Random Oracle Model (ROM), Scyther tool and Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. The security and performance analysis showed that our scheme offers more security features across 15 defined criteria with minimal communication and computational costs compared to other related schemes. The scheme is not only robust against security threats but also practical for implementation in IoT healthcare environment, offering a solution for secure IoT communication by achieving mutual authentication and key agreement with minimized computational requirements.",

Individuals grapple with the peril of untimely demise from diverse ailments as patients suffer from delayed treatment. The paramount objective is to forge a dependable patient care system utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling physicians to monitor patients' well-being within medical facilities or even the confines of their homes. The system aids in tracking the patient's SpO2 level, body temperature, pulse rate (beats per minute), room temperature, and humidity, then trains the data with machine learning algorithms for the patient and finally monitors it through the Blynk IoT system. The cloud-stored data can be harnessed to ascertain and supervise one's health and predict forthcoming perils. This study unveils an efficacious decision-making model custom-tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) ventures, and the proposed trained algorithm satiates these requirements, offering efficiency and precision, rendering it appropriate for numerous IoT applications. Finally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is used here for finding out the most influential parameters, and Explainable AI (XAI) is utilized with the help of SHAP values for enhanced information on affecting parameters. The SVC model's hyperparameter is properly adjusted, yielding a testing accuracy of 98.83 % and a training accuracy of 98.71 %. On cross-validation, the lightweight Sklearn model achieved a mean accuracy of almost 99 %. And with a SHAP weightage magnitude of 1.38, 0.91, and 0.44 for Class âGoodâ, Class âPoorâ, and Class âBadâ, respectively, patients SpO2 level is the most significant feature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDue in large part to the proliferation of electronic financial transactions, credit card fraud is a serious problem for customers, merchants, and banks. For this reason, a novel approach is offered to fraud detection that makes use of cutting-edge ML methods in an IoT setting. The method in this paper employs a carefully selected set of cutting-edge ML algorithms specifically designed to handle the complexities of fraud detection, in contrast to older approaches that have difficulty adapting to shifting fraud patterns. In order to address the many facets of the problem, the methodology employs a large collection of ML models. These models include deep neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, and clustering methods. This paper provides a solution that is able to detect fraudulent activity in real time by efficiently analyzing massive amounts of transactional data thanks to the power of big data processing and cloud computing. The model is able to distinguish between valid and fraudulent transactions thanks to careful feature engineering and anomaly detection methods. Extensive experiments on a large and diverse collection of real and simulated credit card transactions, both legitimate and fraudulent, prove the success of this technique. The findings demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in fraud detection, with increased precision and recall rates compared to traditional methods. And because the presented ML models are easy to understand, they improve fraud risk management and prevention techniques. The findings of this study provide banking institutions, government agencies, and policymakers with vital information for combating the negative effects of credit card fraud on consumers, companies, and the economy as a whole. This study provides a solution to the problem of fraud in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and paves the way for future developments in this crucial area by proposing a unique ML-driven approach to the problem.",

Despite India's agricultural dominance, productivity has consistently declined due to various factors, leading to economic and farmer losses. This study introduces a dual-approach research deployment aimed at enhancing agricultural management efficiency. The first approach involves utilization of remote sensing descriptors to identify moisture deficit areas using vegetation-moisture indices, land surface temperature and slope-elevation profiles. The descriptors were computed using a ten-year period from 2015â2024 using Sentinel-2 data. The second approach involves the deployment of soil moisture sensors integrated with microcontrollers and IoT infrastructure for real-time monitoring. Soil moisture levels were monitored at real-time during morning, afternoon and evening time-periods with specific thresholds identified for urgent watering and optimum moisture conditions. Data was collected and tested at moisture deficit areas identified by remote sensing descriptors at South and North Roorkee, achieving 97.24 % precision score in real-time alerts. The system developed and portrayed in this research is termed as âSMARTSâ (Sustainable Management and Agriculture Resource Technology System) which is scalable and flexible for being deployed at any geographical location offering a robust foundation for future sustainable farming.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (150KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, the effective integration of these technologies within dynamic road environments poses significant challenges, highlighting the need for innovative multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches to optimize their deployment. This study tries to solve the integration problem by proposing an MCDM method that uses fuzzy sets to evaluate and rank different scenarios for better performance of augmented intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) in CAVs. This research uses two key techniques: the Fuzzy Logarithm of Incremental Weights (F-LMAW) method for criteria evaluation and the Fermatean Fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (FF-WASPAS) method for scenario evaluation. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the results, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The study's results showed that the third scenario (the integration of augmented intelligence and IoT in urban areas via self-powered sensors) got the highest score, which shows how important it is compared to the other choices. The obtained results highlight the importance of integrating augmented intelligence and IoT technologies to enhance public transportation with autonomous vehicles equipped with self-powered sensors.",

The study also analyses and compares various technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa and ZigBee, to determine which ones are best suited for IoT system design.\nThe conceptual design of the proposed IoT monitoring system considers the geographical, communication and coverage characteristics of the NIZs and the technical characteristics of the energy projects to provide a complete functional system that can connect approximately 2 million people located in these isolated and vulnerable zones. Finally, the defined system can serve as a precedent for building prototypes in various NIZs, and research on IoT technologies suitable for NIZs can help us seek the technologies that are most suitable for these areas.

Resilient applications in safety, healthcare, and industrial processes rely heavily on continuous connectivity and interaction with surrounding objects. But the IoT ecosystem's enormous number of businesses and apps significantly raises the possibility of unwanted access, raising worries about cyberattacks. It is important to protect symmetrical networks used in modern communication from these dangers. With an emphasis on a sophisticated intrusion detection and prevention system based on Deep Belief Symmetrical Networks (DBNs), this study investigates cutting edge techniques and tactics for preventing security breaches. Our research specifically investigates possibly dangerous behaviour within IoT symmetrical networks and attempts to determine its source. We present a DBN-protected material improved symmetrical intrusion prevention sensor system that improves IoT device security. We improve the system's capacity to identify and prevent cyber-attacks by exploiting DBNs. We compare the suggested method's performance to industry-standard Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) algorithms and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to assess its effectiveness. We create results that demonstrate the usefulness of our method in fighting against cyber-attacks in the IoT environment through rigorous research and testing. This study advances the development of safe IoT Symmetrical devices and encourages the full realization of their promise in allowing a connected and intelligent world.",

Traditional evacuation plans often struggle with slow response times and suboptimal path planning in real-time dynamic and complex fire scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes the IoT-based DWM-Evac model for fire emergency evacuation path planning. The model leverages IoT technology by using various sensors placed inside buildings to monitor fire incidents and spread in real-time, collecting critical data such as temperature, smoke concentration, and flame location. It integrates Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Markov Decision Process (MDP) to enhance path efficiency and safety. Experimental results indicate that the DWM-Evac model achieves an average evacuation time of 315 s in a virtual mall environment, 25 s shorter than traditional plans, with an average path length of 255 meters and a path safety score of 0.92, higher than the traditional planâs 0.88. The application of IoT in fire emergency management not only improves response speed but also optimizes path planning, significantly enhancing personnel safety.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe deployment of resource-constrained and densely distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices poses significant challenges for 5G communication systems due to the increased likelihood of inter-tier interference. This interference can degrade network performance and hinder the transmission of data in a reliable and efficient manner. Using an incremental Radial Basis Function (RBF) technique, this paper proposes a novel approach for cross-tier interference mitigation in 5G communication among resource-constrained dense IoT networks. Utilizing the incremental RBF method to model and optimize interference patterns in resource-constrained dense IoT networks is the primary innovation of our approach. In contrast to conventional interference mitigation techniques, which view interference as a static phenomenon, our method adapts to the dynamic nature of IoT networks by incrementally updating the RBF model. This enables precise modeling of the various interference scenarios and real-time modification of interference mitigation parameters. Utilizing the spatial distribution of IoT devices, this approach improves interference mitigation. The proposed method intelligently allocates resources and optimizes interference mitigation parameters based on the location and density of IoT devices. This adaptive resource allocation improves network capacity, reliability, and overall system performance by maximizing the utilization of available resources while minimizing interference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the incremental RBF-based approach in mitigating cross-tier interference in resource-constrained dense IoT networks within the 5G ecosystem through extensive experiments and simulations. Our findings indicate substantial improvements in communication performance, including increased throughput, decreased packet loss, and decreased latency.",

In order to manage the mobility of nodes in the IoT, mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are crucial. It enables IoT-based systems to construct and connect networks autonomously. IoT based MANET is more vulnerable to Jamming attacks (Jammers) due to the decentralized nature of the ad hoc network. Therefore, secure communication is a crucial requirement for nodes. In this paper, jammers interfere with the IoT MANET communication resulting in order to degrade network performance in terms of delay, throughput and PDR (Packet Delivery Rate) which are the important QoS (Quality of Service) parameters to measure the network performance. The IoT ad hoc system's networking is based on MANET routing protocols so that (GRP, AODV and OLSR) routing protocols had been examined in this paper to improve the QoS (Packet Delivery rate, throughput and delay) of the IoT-MANET system using Riverbed Modeler (17.5) simulation program for different mobile applications. The outcomes showed that the selection of a suitable routing protocol would improve the degradation in delay, throughput and PDR of the ad hoc network.",

Existing methods often fall short in handling high-noise and low-contrast images in complex underwater environments, lacking precision and robustness. This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT model that incorporates GraphSage for capturing and processing complex structural data, SVAM for guiding attention toward critical features, and DSGAT for refining feature relationships by emphasizing differences and similarities. These components work together to enhance the modelâs robustness and precision in underwater target recognition and tracking. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate real-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and model responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT model achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the SeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models. This IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex backgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the system. This research provides an effective IoT solution for underwater target detection technology, offering significant practical application value and broad development prospects.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, IoT systems have been widely applied in healthcare, transportation, home, and other fields. However, with the continuous expansion of the scale and increasing complexity of IoT systems, the stability and security issues of IoT systems have become increasingly prominent. Thus, it is crucial to detect anomalies in the collected IoT time series from various sensors. Recently, deep learning models have been leveraged for IoT anomaly detection. However, owing to the challenges associated with data labeling, most IoT anomaly detection methods resort to unsupervised learning techniques. Nevertheless, the absence of accurate abnormal information in unsupervised learning methods limits their performance. To address these problems, we propose AS-GCN-MTM, an adaptive structural Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)-based framework using a mean-teacher mechanism (AS-GCN-MTM) for anomaly identification. It performs better than unsupervised methods using only a small amount of labeled data. Mean Teachers is an effective semi-supervised learning method that utilizes unlabeled data for training to improve the generalization ability and performance of the model. However, the dependencies between data are often unknown in time series data. To solve this problem, we designed a graph structure adaptive learning layer based on neural networks, which can automatically learn the graph structure from time series data. It not only better captures the relationships between nodes but also enhances the modelâs performance by augmenting key data. Experiments have demonstrated that our method improves the baseline model with the highest F1 value by 10.4%, 36.1%, and 5.6%, respectively, on three real datasets with a 10% data labeling rate.",

In particular, the experimentation is conducted on tomatoes grown at three different irrigation regimes: namely, at 100%, 60%, and 30% of the Italian irrigation recommendation service, denoted as Irriframe. The proposed platform, denoted as Agriware, is able to: (i) evaluate information from heterogeneous data sources, (ii) calculate agronomic indicators (e.g., Growing Degree Days, GDD), and (iii) monitor on-field parameters (e.g., water consumption). Different plant-related parameters have been collected to assess the response to water stress (e.g., Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD), chlorophyll content, fluorescence, and others), along with leaf color and final production evaluations. The obtained results show that the best irrigation regime, in terms of plant health and productivity, corresponds to 60% of Irriframe, allowing significant water savings for the cultivation.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (297KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly advanced intrusion detection systems, effectively addressing potential malicious attacks across networks. This paper introduces a robust method for detecting and categorizing attacks within the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, leveraging the NSL-KDD dataset. To achieve high accuracy, the authors used the feature extraction technique in combination with an auto-encoder, integrated with a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Therefore, the accurate features are selected by using the cuckoo search algorithm integrated particle swarm optimization (PSO), and PSO has been employed for training the features. The final classification of features has been carried out by using the proposed RF-GNB random forest with the Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier. The proposed model has been evaluated and its performance is verified with some of the standard metrics such as precision, accuracy rate, recall F1-score, etc., and has been compared with different existing models. The generated results that detected approximately 99.87% of intrusions within the IoT environments, demonstrated the high performance of the proposed method. These results affirmed the efficacy of the proposed method in increasing the accuracy of intrusion detection within IoT network systems.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nDimensionality reduction is vital to machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems, particularly for IoT networks, which are sensitive to computational resources. Two directions are mostly used: feature selection and feature extraction. Thus, this paper conducted a comparative evaluation of these two methods with the following key contributions:\nâ¢\nA comprehensive performance evaluation between feature selection and feature extraction, involving performance metrics and run-time using the IoT data set, is conducted and evaluated.\nâ¢\nThe 3-phase machine learning pipeline framework, involving data preprocessing, feature reduction, and classification with multiple machine learning classifiers, is created for performance evaluation.\nâ¢\nThe NIDS for IoT is tested using public IoT datasets, named Network TON-IoT, to build models and compare performance between two feature reduction methods.\nAbstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices are extensively utilized but are susceptible to cyberattacks, posing significant security challenges. To mitigate these threats, machine learning techniques have been implemented for network intrusion detection in IoT environments. These techniques commonly employ various feature reduction methods, prior to inputting data into models, in order to enhance the efficiency of detection processes to meet real-time requirements. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of feature selection (FS) and feature extraction (FE) techniques for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) in IoT environments, utilizing the TON-IoT and BoT-IoT datasets for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. We evaluated FS methods, including Pearson correlation and Chi-square, and FE methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders (AE), across five classic machine learning models: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our analysis revealed that FE techniques generally achieve higher accuracy and robustness compared to FS methods, with RF paired with AE delivering superior performance despite higher computational demands. DTs are most effective with smaller feature sets, while MLPs excel with larger sets. Chi-square is identified as the most efficient FS method, balancing performance and computational efficiency, whereas PCA outperforms AE in runtime efficiency. The study also highlights that FE methods are more effective for complex datasets and less sensitive to feature set size, whereas FS methods show significant performance improvements with more informative features. Despite the higher computational costs of FE methods, they demonstrate a greater capability to detect diverse attack types, making them particularly suitable for complex IoT environments. These findings are crucial for both academic research and industry applications, providing insights into optimizing detection performance and computational efficiency in NIDS for IoT networks.",

This paper extensively explores the classification of diseases in grape plants and provides detailed information about the conducted experiments. It is important to keep track of each crop's current environmental conditions because different environmental conditions, such as humidity, temperature, moisture, leaf wetness, light intensity, wind speed, and wind direction, can affect or sustain the quality of a crop. IoT will increasingly be used in precision agriculture and smart environments to detect, gather, and share data about environmental occurrences. The environmental factor that is active at all times and has an effect on a crop from its cultivation to harvest. With the aid of an IoT, we will monitor the following factors: temperature, humidity, and leaf wetness, all of which have an impact on the overall quality and lifespan of grapes. A Self-created database of weather parameter using sensors is introduced in this article. It consists of 5 categories with a total of 10,000 records. Here, experiment has been carried out using our dataset to predict grape diseases on various machines learning algorithm.

The positive and negative product costs of water purification, syrup manufacture, concentrate mixing, and packing were analyzed. The MFCA analysis showed 78.5% positive and 21.5% negative product costs. The use of the Power BI application to display real-time positive and negative costs in each process, scenario modeling and simulation was able to promote water savings and cost reductions, as well as supporting factory team ideation for choosing one of three improvement plans: 1) RO flushing water recovery in water purification; 2) water conservation with automated pH correction at packaging warmer; or 3) wastewater treatment and reuse of the rejected RO brine. According to our two-scenario water conservation testing, an automation process could improve pH adjustment in the packaging process, while MFCA, IoT, and lean management systems could be applied to improve industrial water use efficiency, demonstrating the potential for sustainable water use. The beverage-industry case in the present study validated this approach, resulting in a 24.1% production rate increase and a 4.5% cost reduction of 71,010 THB savings per year.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (237KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, the development of IoT systems, starting from creating specifications, is a serious and time-consuming effort, which requires high levels of expertise. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models, specifically ChatGPT, to streamline the generation of IoT system specifications from initial, unstructured customer requirements. A framework, adapting the ISO IEC/IEEE 12,207:2017 standard, is developed for this purpose. The utility of this framework is validated through the development and expert evaluation of a specification for a campus laboratory IoT use case. The findings demonstrate ChatGPT's effectiveness in producing specifications that are understandable, complete, and unambiguous, thus offering a substantial aid to the industry in overcoming the complexities of IoT system specification development. At the same time, the study identified specific tasks within the requirements engineering process for IoT systems that ChatGPT could not effectively perform, such as verification, obtaining agreements, and maintaining traceability of requirements between stakeholders. The findings offer valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in the domain of IoT development, particularly in automating the specification generation process. These contributions not only advance the understanding of AI's role in IoT development but also open pathways for further research on refining AI-assisted methodologies for system specification and beyond.",

Nonetheless, the implementation of IoT could be improved by assessing various barriers. The purpose of this study was to examine the obstacles related to the adaptation of IoT techniques within the construction sector, as well as the effects on the advancement of intelligent building and infrastructure systems. The study employed a mixed-method approach involving exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine six types of barriers: knowledge, technical, standardization, creativity, complexity, and economics. The study revealed that the implementation of IoT for developing smart construction and infrastructure in the construction sector was significantly influenced by all six constructs. The results of this study offer significant ramifications for the field. The study underscores the necessity for heightened consciousness and instruction regarding the advantages of implementing IoT. The study posits that the technical barriers, including interoperability, modernization of legacy infrastructure, and coordination and collaboration difficulties, require attention from the industry.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper delves into the critical need for enhanced security measures within the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape due to inherent vulnerabilities in IoT devices, rendering them susceptible to various forms of cyber-attacks. The study emphasizes the importance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for continuous threat monitoring. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of feature selection (FS) methods using various machine learning (ML) techniques for classifying traffic flows within datasets containing intrusions in IoT environments. An extensive benchmark analysis of ML techniques and FS methods was performed, assessing feature selection under different approaches including Filter Feature Ranking (FFR), Filter-Feature Subset Selection (FSS), and Wrapper-based Feature Selection (WFS). FS becomes pivotal in handling vast IoT data by reducing irrelevant attributes, addressing the curse of dimensionality, enhancing model interpretability, and optimizing resources in devices with limited capacity. Key findings indicate the outperformance for traffic flows classification of certain tree-based algorithms, such as J48 or PART, against other machine learning techniques (naive Bayes, multi-layer perceptron, logistic, adaptive boosting or k-Nearest Neighbors), showcasing a good balance between performance and execution time. FS methods' advantages and drawbacks are discussed, highlighting the main differences in results obtained among different FS approaches. Filter-feature Subset Selection (FSS) approaches such as CFS could be more suitable than Filter Feature Ranking (FFR), which may select correlated attributes, or than Wrapper-based Feature Selection (WFS) methods, which may tailor attribute subsets for specific ML techniques and have lengthy execution times. In any case, reducing attributes via FS has allowed optimization of classification without compromising accuracy. In this study, F1 score classification results above 0.99, along with a reduction of over 60% in the number of attributes, have been achieved in most experiments conducted across four datasets, both in binary and multiclass modes. This work emphasizes the importance of a balanced attribute selection process, taking into account threat detection capabilities and computational complexity.",

As these threats become more sophisticated, the imperative to fortify IoT devices against emerging vulnerabilities becomes increasingly pronounced. This research is motivated by the need for comprehensive IoT threat detection solutions that can effectively address the evolving threat landscape. Existing approaches often fall short in adapting to the dynamic nature of IoT environments and the increasing complexity of attacks. The core problem addressed in this research is the development of a novel Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) architecture tailored for precise and efficient IoT threat detection. This architecture aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods and enhance the security of IoT ecosystems. Our study encompasses a detailed analysis of the proposed Hybrid CNN-LSTM model, leveraging data from diverse datasets, including IoT-23, N-BaIoT, and CICIDS2017. The proposed model is tested and validated on more than 14 attack types. We have designed this model to exhibit robust threat detection capabilities by effectively capturing and analyzing IoT security data. The outcomes of our research showcase remarkable accuracy, with the models achieving 95% accuracy on the IoT-23 dataset and an outstanding 99% accuracy on both the N-BaIoT and CICIDS2017 datasets. These findings underscore the model's adaptability to various IoT environments. Our research contributes a comprehensive Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture that significantly enhances IoT threat detection. We introduce Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize data processing and incorporate advanced optimization techniques like model quantization and pruning to improve deployment efficiency in resource-constrained IoT environments. This study lays the foundation for future advancements in bolstering IoT security.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has led to rapid growth in smart cities. However, IoT botnet-based attacks against smart city systems are becoming more prevalent. Detection methods for IoT botnet-based attacks have been the subject of extensive research, but the identification of early-stage behaviour of the IoT botnet prior to any attack remains a largely unexplored area that could prevent any attack before it is launched. Few studies have addressed the early stages of IoT botnet detection using monolithic deep learning algorithms that could require more time for training and detection. We, however, propose an edge-based deep learning system for the detection of the early stages of IoT botnets in smart cities. The proposed system, which we call EDIT (Edge-based Detection of early-stage IoT Botnet), aims to detect abnormalities in network communication traffic caused by early-stage IoT botnets based on the modular neural network (MNN) method at multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers. MNN can improve detection accuracy and efficiency by leveraging parallel computing on MEC. According to the findings, EDIT has a lower false-negative rate compared to a monolithic approach and other studies. At the MEC server, EDIT takes as little as 16 ms for the detection of an IoT botnet.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancement of artificial intelligence, 3D human pose estimation-based systems for sports training and posture correction have gained significant attention in adolescent sports. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex movements, providing real-time feedback, and accommodating diverse postures, particularly with occlusions, rapid movements, and the resource constraints of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, making it difficult to balance accuracy and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose GTA-Net, an intelligent system for posture correction and real-time feedback in adolescent sports, integrated within an IoT-enabled environment. This model enhances pose estimation in dynamic scenes by incorporating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Hierarchical Attention mechanisms, achieving real-time correction through IoT devices. Experimental results show GTA-Netâs superior performance on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) values of 32.2 mm, 15.0 mm, and 48.0 mm, respectively, significantly outperforming existing methods. The model also demonstrates strong robustness in complex scenarios, maintaining high accuracy even with occlusions and rapid movements. This system enhances real-time posture correction and offers broad applications in intelligent sports and health management.",

LSD reduces the marketability and productivity of cattle, but it is not fatal. Current preventive measures that rely on routine veterinary testing can be time-consuming and miss early signs of infection, requiring a more effective management strategy first works This article presents an IoT-enabled intelligent system to prevent LSD in animals. The system uses a smart wearable sensor device to collect real-time health information including body temperature, heart rate and 3-axis motion data. Advanced analysis of data is considered to identify early diagnosis of potential LSD infection results based on deviations from normal parameters, this data prevents further infection within livestock by supporting immediate isolation. On a cloud-based online platform, and integrated into the mobile application provides a comprehensive experience and timely alerts to provide potential health issues. Furthermore, the IoT features of the system enable farmers and veterinarians to quickly guide and optimize disease control strategies, improving biosecurity protocols and overall livestock health management. This creative approach represents a significant improvement over traditional methods, providing a cost-effective, accurate and real-time solution for animal health monitoring and management.",

This study focuses on the synthesis of nanostructured silver chromate and their application in dopamine sensing. The nanoparticles were synthesized using a complexation-mediated route using aminosalicylic acid as a stabilizer, resulting in uniform particles ranging from 3 to 15 nm in size. The synthesized silver chromate was characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Electrochemical studies revealed that the silver chromate exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the detection of dopamine. The electroanalysis provided the selective recognition of dopamine with the limit of detection of 1.05 Î¼M and sensitivity of 2.68 Î¼A Î¼Mâ1 cmâ2 in a linear range of 5â45 Î¼M.

        "abstract": "The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding at an unprecedented scale in many critical applications due to the ability to interconnect and utilize a plethora of wide range of devices. In critical infrastructure domains like oil and gas supply, intelligent transportation, power grids, and autonomous agriculture, it is essential to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data collected and exchanged. However, the limited resources coupled with the heterogeneity of IoT devices make it inefficient or sometimes infeasible to achieve secure data transmission using traditional cryptographic techniques. Consequently, designing a lightweight secure data transmission scheme is becoming essential. In this article, we propose lightweight secure data transmission (LSDT) scheme for IoT environments. LSDT consists of three phases and utilizes an effective combination of symmetric keys and the Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone asymmetric key agreement protocol. We design the simulation environment and experiments to evaluate the performance of the LSDT scheme in terms of communication and computation costs. Security and performance analysis indicates that the LSDT scheme is secure, suitable for IoT applications, and performs better in comparison to other related security schemes.",

This paper provides two major contributions: first, it characterizes the NB-IoT architecture and its enhancements in subsequent 3GPP releases; second, it introduces an energy-saving technique for NB-IoT user equipment based on semi-Markov processes. Integrating a Proxy state and an enhanced release assistant indication (ERAI), the proposed technique improves upon the traditional Discontinuous Reception (DRX) method in the NB-IoT standard. This novel approach reduces energy consumption during low data communication, distinguishing it from other power-saving methodologies. The effectiveness of this technique is assessed through the power-saving factor (PSF) under various conditions, such as different eDRX durations (\n), PSM durations (\n), DRX cycle periods (\n), and DRX active periods (\n). Our findings confirm that the proposed Proxy & ERAI technique significantly boosts the power-saving capabilities of NB-IoT devices, especially for small data packet transmissions. Theoretical and simulation results indicate that the PSF can be enhanced by up to 99.4% with optimized eDRX durations (\n) and up to 99.9% with optimized PSM (\n) durations. These results underscore the significant energy-saving potential of our proposed technique, making it highly effective for NB-IoT applications with low data transmission needs.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (115KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the growing integration of IoT devices in critical infrastructure, cybersecurity threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Energy Hubs (EH) have become a significant concern. This study aims to address these challenges by evaluating the effectiveness of various supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting DDoS attacks targeting EH systems through IoT devices. Using the CICDDOS2019 and KDD-CUP datasets, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on several classifiers, including Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The results highlight Gradient Boosting as the most effective model, particularly for the CICDDOS2019 dataset, demonstrating superior accuracy and predictive capability. Additionally, hybrid models combining Gradient Boosting with SVM or DT showed strong performance, though with varying precision and recall. This study provides valuable insights into the selection and tailoring of ML models for specific security challenges, emphasizing the need for ongoing research to enhance the resilience of EH systems and IoT devices against evolving DDoS threats.",

        "abstract": "The security of the wireless sensor network-Internet of Things (WSN-IoT) network is more challenging due to its randomness and self-organized nature. Intrusion detection is one of the key methodologies utilized to ensure the security of the network. Conventional intrusion detection mechanisms have issues such as higher misclassification rates, increased model complexity, insignificant feature extraction, increased training time, increased run time complexity, computation overhead, failure to identify new attacks, increased energy consumption, and a variety of other factors that limit the performance of the intrusion system model. In this research a security framework for WSN-IoT, through a deep learning technique is introduced using Modified Fuzzy-Adaptive DenseNet (MF_AdaDenseNet) and is benchmarked with datasets like NSL-KDD, UNSWNB15, CIDDS-001, Edge IIoT, Bot IoT. In this, the optimal feature selection using Capturing Dingo Optimization (CDO) is devised to acquire relevant features by removing redundant features. The proposed MF_AdaDenseNet intrusion detection model offers significant benefits by utilizing optimal feature selection with the CDO algorithm. This results in enhanced Detection Capacity with minimal computation complexity, as well as a reduction in False Alarm Rate (FAR) due to the consideration of classification error in the fitness estimation. As a result, the combined CDO-based feature selection and MF_AdaDenseNet intrusion detection mechanism outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, achieving maximal Detection Capacity, precision, recall, and F-Measure of 99.46%, 99.54%, 99.91%, and 99.68%, respectively, along with minimal FAR and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.9% and 0.11.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects various devices and objects through the Internet to interact with corresponding devices or machines. Now, consumers can purchase many internet-connected products, from automobiles to refrigerators. Extending network capacities to every aspect of life can save money and time, increase efficiency, and enable greater access to digital experiences. Cybersecurity analysts often refer to this as increasing the attack surface from which hackers can benefit. Implementing the proper security measures is crucial since IoT devices can be vulnerable to cyberattacks and are often built with limited security features. Securing IoT devices involves implementing security measures and best practices to secure them from potential vulnerabilities and threats. Deep learning (DL) models have recently analyzed the network pattern for detecting and responding to possible intrusions, improving cybersecurity with advanced threat detection abilities. Therefore, this study presents a new Hybrid Dung Beetle Optimization-based Dimensionality Reduction with a Deep Learning-based Cybersecurity Solution (HDBODR-DLCS) method on the IoT network. The primary goal of the HDBODR-DLCS technique is to perform dimensionality reduction with a hyperparameter tuning process for enhanced detection results. In the primary stage, the HDBODR-DLCS technique involves Z-score normalization to measure the input dataset. The HDBO model is used for dimensionality reduction, which mainly selects the relevant features and discards the irrelevant features. Besides, intrusions are detected using the attention bidirectional recurrent neural network (ABiRNN) model. Finally, an artificial rabbits optimization (ARO) based hyperparameter tuning process is performed, enhancing the overall classification performance. The empirical analysis of the HDBODR-DLCS method is tested under the benchmark IDS dataset. The simulation outcomes indicated the HDBODR-DLCS method's improved abilities over existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancement of artificial intelligence, 3D human pose estimation-based systems for sports training and posture correction have gained significant attention in adolescent sports. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex movements, providing real-time feedback, and accommodating diverse postures, particularly with occlusions, rapid movements, and the resource constraints of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, making it difficult to balance accuracy and real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose GTA-Net, an intelligent system for posture correction and real-time feedback in adolescent sports, integrated within an IoT-enabled environment. This model enhances pose estimation in dynamic scenes by incorporating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Hierarchical Attention mechanisms, achieving real-time correction through IoT devices. Experimental results show GTA-Netâs superior performance on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) values of 32.2 mm, 15.0 mm, and 48.0 mm, respectively, significantly outperforming existing methods. The model also demonstrates strong robustness in complex scenarios, maintaining high accuracy even with occlusions and rapid movements. This system enhances real-time posture correction and offers broad applications in intelligent sports and health management.",

        "abstract": "The surge in connected devices and massive data aggregation has expanded the scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The proliferation of unknown attacks and related risks, such as zero-day attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks triggered by botnets, have resulted in information leakage and property damage. Therefore, developing an efficient and realistic intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical for ensuring IoT network security. In recent years, traditional machine learning techniques have struggled to learn the complex associations between multidimensional features in network traffic, and the excellent performance of deep learning techniques, as an advanced version of machine learning, has led to their widespread application in intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Convolutional Neural Network Squeeze-and-Excitation (APSO-CNN-SE) model for implementing IoT network intrusion detection. A 2D CNN backbone is initially constructed to extract spatial features from network traffic. Subsequently, a squeeze-and-excitation channel attention mechanism is introduced and embedded into the CNN to focus on critical feature channels. Lastly, the weights and biases in the CNN-SE are extracted to initialize the population individuals of the APSO. As the number of iterations increases, the populationâs position vector is continuously updated, and the cross-entropy loss function value is minimized to produce the ideal network architecture. We evaluated the models experimentally using binary and multiclassification on the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD datasets, comparing and analyzing the evaluation metrics derived from each model. Compared to the base CNN model, the results demonstrate that APSO-CNN-SE enhances the binary classification detection accuracy by 1.84% and 3.53% and the multiclassification detection accuracy by 1.56% and 2.73% on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model outperforms the existing models like DT, KNN, LR, SVM, LSTM, etc., in terms of accuracy and fitting performance. This means that the model can identify potential attacks or anomalies more precisely, improving the overall security and stability of the IoT environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA cost-effective IoT-based real-time data acquisition and analysis hardware system was developed to enhance the performance of the mobile harbor cranes using a combination of a cost-effective quality control monitoring sensor dashboard (proximity sensors, angle position sensor, weight sensor, vibration sensor, and wind sensor), embedded microcontroller (Arduino), and embedded computer (Raspberry Pi). Hardware was operated using a specially developed novel Quality Control and Data Acquisition Multiprocessing software (QC-DAS). The QC-DAS can automatically collect and save real-time data of the sensors in a large-capacity SD card, monitor the state of health of the hardware, and transmit the real-time data of the sensors and the working state of the crane to an IoT server. The novelty of the QC-DAS design is that each function is encapsulated in a predefined module that is \"immersed\" in a message transmission medium. Modules interact by sending and receiving various signals through this medium. Modularity makes system design simpler, faster, and flexible. Thanks to modularity, users may incorporate their data processing modules when new sensors are added to match the system's needs. Thanks to modularity the DC-DAS can operate quality control hardware for any mobile cranes. There are several constraints in the quality control data acquisition system used by the Damietta Port Authority in Damietta, Egypt, SESCO TRANS company which cause the loading and unloading process to be slowed down. As a result, the SESCO TRANS company upgraded its quality control data acquisition system using the QC-DAS. The hardware was deployed for six months, during which the collected data was used to verify the crane's performance. The vibration produced by the slewing of the crane was monitored and compared with the bearing fault frequency limits, during the operation the wind speed was monitored and compared with the critical wind speed to stop the crane operation automatically, and the payloads data of the six months was collected and was used to calculate the working efficiency of the load and unload process of the crane. The results demonstrated that while maintenance costs were decreased, the crane load/unload procedure was improved. The SESCO TRANS company crane operators approved the developed approach and appreciated the achieved results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications generates vast volumes of high-speed data streams from numerous devices. Cloud computing solutions often handle and manage this data; however, for certain applications, the latency introduced by transmitting data from edge devices to the cloud may be unacceptable. This issue is exacerbated by the bandwidth constraints of public networks, which become significant barriers in large-scale IoT implementations. Consequently, effective resource management, service management, data storage, and power management require more robust infrastructure and complex protocols. An \"intelligent gateway\" based on fog computing can enhance the efficient utilization of cloud and network resources. Resource planning and management in a fog-cloud environment significantly impact system performance, particularly latency. This problem is known to be NP-hard. This paper addresses the challenge of lifetime optimization for scheduling data-intensive tasks in fog and cloud-based IoT systems. Initially, we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model to frame the problem. Subsequently, we introduce a heuristic method named Data-Locality Aware Job Scheduling in Fog-Cloud (DLSFC), which is derived from the proposed formulation. The effectiveness of DLSFC is evaluated across various system characteristics, with results demonstrating that DLSFC achieves solutions within 85â¯% of the ideal outcome provided by the LP solver.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nHighlighting the lack of human-focused IoT systems for safety in NZ forestry.\nâ¢\nInvestigating IoT as assistive safety technology in the forestry industry.\nâ¢\nAn IoT system which tracks workersâ locations in and around a geofenced area.\nâ¢\nHighlighting the challenges associated with human-focused IoT for NZ forestry.\nAbstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) solutions are becoming increasingly prevalent in workplace safety. However, some industries are still in their infancy in adopting this technology. The New Zealand forestry industry is one such example. The forestry industry is one of the most dangerous industries in New Zealand (and internationally). Yet, while IoT solutions are being adopted in other industries, human-focused IoT systems for safety in forestry are lacking. The contribution of this paper is to highlight this, investigate whether IoT can be used as assistive safety technology in the New Zealand forestry industry, and highlight the challenges associated with it. To this end, this paper investigates feasible uses of technology for safety and injury prevention in the New Zealand forestry industry by introducing an IoT based system. This includes an outline of the generalised system, a proof-of-concept implementation, and an evaluation of its use within two forestry scenarios. Finally, this paper includes a discussion on how this system could be adapted for use in a variety of scenarios, provides a comparison with other existing approaches, and discusses the challenges involved in developing solutions for use in hazardous industries. This work is part of a larger project centred on the use of technology for safety and injury prevention in the New Zealand forestry industry.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nChronic tinnitus often affects elderly or hearing-impaired individuals, which can disturb their daily lives by disrupting concentration and limiting communication. Clinically, sound masking using external sounds like white noise (WN) aims to mask tinnitus and relieve secondary symptoms. Even when symptoms are relieved, tinnitus often requires long-term management, and for patients to visit healthcare professionals regularly. Generally, it could make maintaining symptom management challenging due to the time and effort required for consistent follow-ups. EEG is considered as one of the objective marker for assessing tinnitus symptoms. In this study, we designed IoT-enabled EEG sensing (IEES) headphones, an innovative IoT device that provided customized music (CM) and EEG measurement. The headphones employed a pitch-matching (PM) method to create CM tailored to each patient at specific frequencies for tinnitus patients. To collect EEG measurements, the device incorporated OpenBCI electrodes and a sensing chip to monitor brain waves and evaluate the outcomes.. After 30 days of experiment, participants showed significant reductions in both tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scores and visual analog scale for annoyance (VAS-A) scores. In comparison, tinnitus frequency showed a slight reduction. EEG measurements demonstrated an increase in alpha band activity. In questionnaires, patients reported high satisfaction with their experiences. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed method for chronic tinnitus assessment and symptom management.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing has become increasingly popular due to its capacity to perform computations without relying on physical infrastructure, thereby revolutionizing computer processes. However, the rising energy consumption in cloud centers poses a significant challenge, especially with the escalating energy costs. This paper tackles this issue by introducing efficient solutions for data placement and node management, with a clear emphasis on the crucial role of the Internet of Things (IoT) throughout the research process. The IoT assumes a pivotal role in this study by actively collecting real-time data from various sensors strategically positioned in and around data centers. These sensors continuously monitor vital parameters such as energy usage and temperature, thereby providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis. The data generated by the IoT is seamlessly integrated into the Hybrid TCN-GRU-NBeat (NGT) model, enabling a dynamic and accurate representation of the current state of the data center environment. Through the incorporation of the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), the NGT model optimizes storage migration strategies based on the latest information provided by IoT sensors. The model is trained using 80% of the available dataset and subsequently tested on the remaining 20%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 5.33% and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.83%, accurately estimating power prices and leading to an average reduction of 23.88% in power costs. Furthermore, the integration of IoT data significantly enhances the accuracy of the NGT model, outperforming benchmark algorithms such as DenseNet, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, and AlexNet. The NGT model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97.9%, surpassing the rates of 87%, 83%, 80%, and 79%, respectively, for the benchmark algorithms. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing energy efficiency and enhancing the predictive capabilities of cloud computing systems. The IoT plays a critical role in driving these advancements by providing real-time data insights into the operational aspects of data centers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAmid rising concerns about campus safety in Taiwan, particularly with the global trend towards smart cities, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) into institutional security frameworks has become pivotal. The paper discusses the implementation of using iBeacons and Long Range (LoRa) technology to locating the student position and ensure his safety in the school campus. It uses Internet of Things (IoT) approach in real time to monitor and locate the student presence in the school compound. This paper unveils an innovative design for a campus security system that harnesses the LoRa technology. In the system, the students are equipped with devices containing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to capture and transmit real-time location data. The system response time to locating student in abnormal locations such as cornered and concealed areas is about one second. By extending this system to cover all individuals on campus, a closely monitored environment and areas is enabled that significantly bolstering the security measures. This not only furnishes a dynamic protective layer for educational institutions but also serves as a proactive deterrent against potential security breaches. Ultimately, this research underscores the transformative potential of merging IoT with campus security to ushering in a new era of student safety. LoRa technology offers advantages in battery life, cost-effectiveness, deployment flexibility, and network coverage etc. Therefore, this paper ultimately provides a method of how to utilize the LoRa technology to develop a campus security system. Unlike artificial intelligence (AI)-based image recognition, which raises concerns about privacy and human rights; the features of LoRaâs long-range communication and low power consumption make it a more suitable choice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAnnually, the proportion of individuals suffering from cardiovascular disease rises significantly. Heart attacks are the most prevalent and unpleasant illness among them. Heart disease (HD) diagnosis can be complicated when there are multiple symptoms. The growing popularity of wearable smart devices has increased the likelihood of providing the Internet of Things (IoT). However, one of the biggest obstacles to overcome in implementing the system under IoT is developing a lightweight model for cardiac diagnosis and categorization. In this paper, we have presented a two-step heart disease classification method. This method includes demarcation of classes with the help of optimized non-linear support vector machine technique in the first step and determining the modified fuzzy class in the second step. Initially, pre-processing is accomplished using the ECG signals to eliminate noise and improve signal smoothness. Subsequently, features such as PQRS wave, linear characteristics, and reciprocal information are extracted from pre-processed signals. At the classification stage, the two-stage learning system is used to classify cardiac arrhythmias. First, using the wild horse optimization (WHO) technique (WHO-sigmoid-TH-NL-demarcation), each class is subjected to a binary classification based on feature demarcation, thresholding, and weighting of the sigmoid function. The information from the first stage will be transferred into the subsequent stage for an equal number of heart disease classifications. In the second step, a TS fuzzy logic system optimized by the Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC) approach (GPC-TS-Fuzzy) is utilized to classify each signal. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset is used to assess the suggested approach. In a comprehensive evaluation of the suggested method, performance metrics including âaccuracy, sensitivity, and specificityâ yielded average values of 98.58 %, 98.13 %, and 96.47 %, respectively. The MATLAB platform is utilized to accomplish the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current extensive deployment of IoT devices, crucial for enhancing smart computing applications in diverse domains, necessitates the utilization of essential 5G features, notably network slicing, to ensure the provision of distinct and reliable services. However, the voluminous, dynamic, and varied nature of IoT traffic introduces complexities in network flow classification, traffic analysis, and the accurate determination of network requirements. These complexities pose a significant challenge in effectively provisioning 5G network slices across various applications. To address this, we propose an innovative approach for network traffic classification, comprising a pipeline that integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with KMeans clustering and the Hellinger distance measure. The application of PCA as the initial step effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the original information, which significantly lowers the computational demands for the subsequent KMeans clustering phase. KMeans, an unsupervised learning method, eliminates the labor-intensive and error-prone process of data labeling. Following this, a Hellinger distance-based recursive KMeans algorithm is employed to merge similar clusters, aiding in the determination of the optimal number of clusters. This results in final clustering outcomes that are both compact and intuitively interpretable, overcoming the inherent limitations of the traditional KMeans algorithm, such as its sensitivity to initial conditions and the requirement for manually specifying the number of clusters. An evaluation of our method using a real-world IoT dataset has shown that our pipeline can efficiently represent the dataset in three distinct clusters. The characteristics of these clusters can be readily understood and directly correlated with various types of network slices in the 5G network, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in managing the complexities of IoT traffic for 5G network slice provisioning.",

These toolkits present a novel opportunity to foster the inclusion of this often-under-considered community in the development of personalized solutions that can impact their autonomy and well-being.

To fill this gap, this paper illustrates the design and evaluation of MakeNodes, a tangible toolkit to involve people with ID in making smart-thing networks in a guided, collaborative, and engaging way. The toolkit comprises a series of input and output nodes that can be paired to make any object or surface smart.

The local farming industry requires advancements in technology to address the complexities of food production. This motivates the exploration of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to reduce reliance on manpower and enhance farming efficiency. However, the current integrated IoT solutions for smart farms can be expensive and complicated, rendering them redundant for small-area farms that do not require advanced technologies or machine learning. This study aims to optimize IoT LoRa parameter settings, focusing on providing affordable solutions tailored for fruit and vegetable farms. The main goal is to address the common issue faced by farmersâinvesting in expensive IoT-enabled wireless sensors without realizing a return on investment. To overcome this challenge, a simple and cost-effective IoT solution is proposed, utilising sensors and readily available applications to achieve efficient farming practises. The main objective is to develop an integrated IoT solution tailored for fruit and vegetable farms, facilitating improved productivity and growth. The solution incorporates sensors to monitor and control various aspects of crop cultivation, collecting essential data. The research development here also aims to inspire low-cost IoT solutions suitable for small-scale food plantation farms by using the long-range physical communication technique (LoRa) protocol. Leveraging IoT technologies in a simplified manner allows local farming industries to boost productivity, lower operational costs, and effectively address food security concerns. In addition to the IoT technology development for smart farms, the research here also investigates the various factors affecting the performance of LoRa-enabled IoT solutions for smart farms, including LoRa frequency, distance, environment, and the performance of the IoT system under different weather conditions, showed a significant effect on system performance (p â¤ 0.05). This comprehensive approach aims to contribute valuable insights for the development and implementation of cost-effective IoT solutions tailored for small-scale agricultural practices. In conclusion, this project demonstrates the efficiency of LoRa-based IoT in agriculture and highlights areas for improvement. Future directions involve improving scalability, streamlining the user interface, and adding sophisticated features to support the development of productive, networked, and environmentally friendly farming methods.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (201KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWireless sensor networks those based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have evolved fast in numerous areas in recent years. Devices and sensors may interact with each other without human involvement in the IoT network. An IoT-based system where people and things are connected by wired and wireless technology including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), ZigBee, NFC, RFID, GPRS, LTE, and Bluetooth is now one of the most popular technical ideas. The potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) has received enormous attention from the corporate and scientific communities during the past 10 years. The IoT can provide a number of significant benefits to application spaces. Researchers may be able to show crucial facts about IoT-based smart environmental monitoring systems. IoT has faced a variety of challenges, including authentication, differentiating evidence, accessibility and security and protection. Sociotechnical trust systems have also been examined in the past in various studies (STTS). Existing smart settings are now dealing with serious IoT security, protection, and STTS challenges.

        "abstract": "In the face of the effective popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), but the frequent occurrence of cybersecurity incidents, various cybersecurity protection means have been proposed and applied. Among them, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been proven to be stable and efficient. However, traditional intrusion detection methods have shortcomings such as low detection accuracy and inability to effectively identify malicious attacks. To address the above problems, this paper fully considers the superiority of deep learning models in processing high-dimensional data, and reasonable data type conversion methods can extract deep features and detect classification using advanced computer vision techniques to improve classification accuracy. The Markov Transform Field (MTF) method is used to convert 1D network traffic data into 2D images, and then the converted 2D images are filtered by Unsharp Masking to enhance the image details by sharpening; to further improve the accuracy of data classification and detection, unlike using the existing high-performance baseline image classification models, a soft-voting integrated model, which integrates three deep learning models, MobileNet, VGGNet and ResNet, to finally obtain an effective IoT intrusion detection architecture: the MUS model. Four types of experiments are conducted on the publicly available intrusion detection dataset CICIDS2018 and the IoT network traffic dataset N_BaIoT, and the results demonstrate that the accuracy of attack traffic detection is greatly improved, which is not only applicable to the IoT intrusion detection environment, but also to different types of attacks and different network environments, which confirms the effectiveness of the work done.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) network infrastructures are becoming more susceptible to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks because of the proliferation of IoT devices. Detecting and predicting such attacks in this complex and dynamic environment requires specialized techniques. This study presents an approach to detecting and predicting DDoS attacks from a realistic multidimensional dataset specifically tailored to IoT network environments, named DDoSNet. At the beginning of the data preprocessing phase, the dataset must be cleaned up, missing values must be handled, and the data needs to be transformed into an acceptable format for analysis. Several preprocessing approaches, including data-cleaning algorithms and imputation methods, are used to improve the accuracy and dependability of the data. Following this, feature selection uses the African Buffalo Optimization with Decision Tree (ABO-DT) method. This nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm imitates the behaviour of African buffalos to determine which traits are the most important. By integrating ABO with the decision tree, a subset of features is selected that maximizes the discrimination between regular network traffic and DDoS attacks. After feature selection, an echo-state network (ESN) classifier is employed for detection and prediction. A recurrent neural network (RNN) that has shown potential for managing time-series data is known as an ESN. The ESN classifier utilizes the selected features to learn the underlying patterns and dynamics of network traffic, enabling accurate identification of DDoS attacks. Based on the simulations, the proposed DDOSNet had an accuracy of 98.98 %, a sensitivity of 98.62 %, a specificity of 98.85 %, an F-measure of 98.86 %, a precision of 98.27 %, an MCC of 98.95 %, a Dice coefficient of 98.04 %, and a Jaccard coefficient of 98.09 %, which are better than the current best methods.",

The present study deals with the intricate linkage of internet of things (IoT) devices and the resilience of structures in a seismically affected zone. From the literature, the role of adaptive structural control, data acquisition and transmission, early warning systems, integration with building standards and codes, and real-time analytics and monitoring have been found to be the topmost aspects of ensuring resilience to seismic events. The seismically affected area of concern provides an in-depth analysis of the practical applications of the IoT in buildings in a seismic area. A survey was distributed to 239 respondents, and a very solid 58.99 % response rate proved the interest and participation of the respondents in the study. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), the researchers frame a measurement model which is applied to analyze the reliability and validity of the IoT constructs. Further, the bootstrap resampling mechanisms are adopted to test the five hypotheses rigorously. The findings establish robust connections between adaptive structural control, data acquisition, early warning systems, integration with building codes and standards, real-time monitoring and analytics, and IoT, contributing to enhanced seismic resilience. Infrastructure developers can draw management implications from these findings, while empirical researchers can utilize the verified framework to guide future studies.",

It plays a decisive role in enhancing the quality of decision-making and operational efficiency. However, the storage and authenticity verification of large-scale IoT real-time data present unprecedented technical challenges. Faced with the inherent data security risks of traditional centralized cloud storage, blockchain technology reveals its unique potential for solutions with its inherent immutability and decentralization. Nevertheless, current blockchain-based data storage solutions are still restricted by high costs and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this paper innovatively proposes the BI-TSFID framework, which leverages the benefits of Ethereum and IPFS and optimizes the Merkle Tree structure and verification mechanisms. The BI-TSFID framework adopts a strategy of on-chain data summary storage and off-chain computation. This approach provides IoT with efficient and reliable data storage, reduces operational costs, and simplifies the verification process. This research has improved the data computation efficiency by refining the structure of the Merkle Tree and analyzed its optimal branch number. Additionally, the study introduces a sampling-based data integrity verification method that significantly reduces resource consumption during the verification process. Experimental results show that the solutions proposed in this paper effectively enhance the efficiency and security of IoT data management and provide valuable guidance for the theory and practice of real-time data storage and verification, further promoting the development and innovation in the related technological fields.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe wide use of sensors in healthcare applications has made it necessary to have secure communication in healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The sensor data is sensitive, and can contain extremely confidential information such as medical diagnosis, clinical records, vital signs and health data of patients. The emergence of blockchain as a technology ensures consensus and trust among systems, and is now considered to be a new trend used to achieve high scalability, data integrity and privacy. Federated learning is a new technology based on distributed learning that exploits the concept of trust. In federated learning, each user builds an individual distributed model to help a central server that is accessible only to a trusted user group. This paper harnesses the potential of these approaches and proposes an attack detection model to discern normal user behaviours from that of adversaries in an IoT network. This model is called the Blockchain enabled Federated Learning model for secured communication in healthcare IoT (BFL-hIoT), to secure data in healthcare IoT networks. This model is trained and tested on a standard dataset and demonstrates the highest classification accuracy of 97.16 % for normal, 0.9546 for backdoors, 0.9618 for XSS etc., outperforming other blockchain and deep learning models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things communication protocol is prone to security vulnerabilities when facing increasing types and scales of network attacks, which can affect the communication security of the Internet of Things. It is crucial to effectively detect these vulnerabilities in order to improve the security of IoT communication protocols and promptly fix them. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed IoT communication protocol vulnerability detection method based on an improved parallelized fuzzy testing algorithm. Firstly, based on design principles and by comparing different communication protocols, a communication architecture for the distribution network's Internet of Things was constructed, and the communication protocols were formalized and decomposed. Next, preprocess the vulnerability detection samples, and then use genetic algorithm to improve the parallelized fuzzy testing algorithm to perform vulnerability detection. Through this improved algorithm, the missed detection rate and false detection rate can be effectively reduced, thereby improving the security of IoT communication protocols. The experimental results show that the highest missed detection rate of this method is only 4.0 %, and the false detection rate is low, with high detection efficiency. This indicates that the method has good performance and reliability in detecting vulnerabilities in IoT communication protocols.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents the design of a robust IoT (Internet of Things) system developed for Smart Beaches Applications that allows the planning and smart management of these areas. The contributions of this development were to implement low-cost and maintained-free hardware devices with wireless data transmission based on Sigfox LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) technology, evaluation of the application, and overcome the aggressive environment where nodes were placed. Nodes have a low power consumption, which allows to be supplied by batteries, and these batteries are recharged by an energy harvesting module with solar panels. These nodes include different sensors for monitoring physical parameters such as: temperature, relative humidity, ultraviolet index, etc. Sensorsâ data are transmitted via the network base stations to an IoT platform and from there to an application server. A database has been designed to save the data and make it available to tourists via a mobile application. In this way, the proposed IoT system achieves real-time monitoring of the existing environmental conditions at beaches and provides tourists with information on the environmental situation of the beach. The node developed presents an average current and power consumption of 1.88 mA and 6 mW, respectively. This consumption allows an autonomous operation without solar panels for around 10 days with a full charged 500 mA battery. Conducted experiments with real deployments at beaches in the Mediterranean coast of Spain have proved that, in case of operating the nodes with solar panels and protecting them adequately, they can run for several years without maintenance thanks to a ruggedized electronic.",

This prompts a demand for innovative solutions to foster sustainability in farming while emphasizing the limitations of conventional farming methods. To address these challenges in modern agriculture systems, this research proposes a comprehensive framework for smart farming. The proposed framework comprises of three technology integrations: 1) an efficient integration of renewable energy resources (RERs) with solar panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS), 2) an IoT-based environmental monitoring for precision irrigation, and 3) an android application-controlled precision robotic system for targeted chemical application. The proposed framework investigates a case study on Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to explore and analyze optimal scenarios of multiple energy resources. Results demonstrate successful cross-prototype integration through the Blynk IoT platform providing users with a unified interface. Furthermore, the results provide a comprehensive analysis and investigation into the interactions between RERs and the grid across various combinations. The findings indicate the potential of this framework to revolutionize agriculture and thus offer a sustainable, efficient, and technologically advanced approach. It also represents the contribution of a complete solution to modern agricultural challenges presenting tangible results for a promising future in smart and sustainable farming practices.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (257KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the domain of efficient management of resources and ensuring nutritional consistency, accuracy in predicting crop yields becomes crucial. The advancement of artificial intelligence techniques, synchronized with satellite imagery, has emerged as a potent approach for forecasting crop yields in modern times. We used two types of data: spatial data and temporal data. Spatial data are gathered from satellite imagery and processed using ArcGIS to extract data about crops based on several indices like NDVI and NWDI. Temporal data are gathered from agricultural sensors such as temperature sensors, rainfall sensor, precipitation sensor and soil moisture sensor. In our case we used Sentinel 2 satellite to extract vegetation indices. We have used IoT systems, especially Raspberry Pi B+ to collect and process data coming from sensors. All data collected are then stored into a NoSQL server to be analysed and processed. Several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used for the processing of crop recommendation system, such as logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, support vector machine, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM through the collected dataset. We used GRU deep learning model for the best performance, the RMSE and R2 for this model was 0.00036 and 0.99 respectively.\nThe main contribution of our paper is the development of a new system that can predict several crop yields, such as wheat, maize, etc., using IoT, satellite imagery for spatial data and the use of sensors for temporal data. We are the first paper that has combined spatial data and temporal data to predict crop yield based on deep learning algorithms, unlike other works that uses only remote sensing data or temporal data. We created an E-monitoring crop yield prediction system that helps farmers track all information about crops and show the result of prediction in a mobile application. This system helps farmers with more efficient decision making to enhance crop production. The main production regions of wheat in Morocco are in the rainfed areas of the plains and plateaus of Chaouia, Abda, Haouz, Tadla, Gharb and SaÃ¯s. We studied three main regions well known for wheat production which are Rabat-SalÃ©, Fez-Meknes, Casablanca-Settat.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh-resolution pathological images play a pivotal role in accurate disease diagnosis and are important in precision medicine. However, obtaining real-time high-resolution images faces challenges due to hardware limitations and scanning time constraints. Conventional image super-resolution restoration algorithms struggle to provide satisfactory results for pathological images, resulting in blurred and unrealistic restorations. In response to this challenge, this research proposes a pioneering approach by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology with Local Attention Dual Network (IOT-LAT) for super-resolution restoration of pathological images. The enhanced IOT-LATincorporates IoT-based data acquisition and processing, IoT-Enhanced non-local attention mechanisms, Gaussian constraint, and parameter-sharing strategies in up-sampling and down-sampling branches. This integration enables real-time super-resolution restoration of pathological images with improved accuracy. The reconstructed images exhibit a structural similarity of 0.914 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 30.84 dB. These results validate the effectiveness of the suggested approach in precisely reconstructing high-frequency details and improving modelling efficiency via a lightweight non-local attention mechanism enhanced by the Internet of Things. This work discusses IoT and non-local attention dual networks to improve pathological image super-resolution restoration. This allows for faster and more accurate disease diagnosis and treatment in precision medicine.",

Traditional smart home devices are complex to operate, resulting in high learning costs. They also lack security and reliability, and cannot guarantee the use and safety of the elderly and children, limiting their popularity.

This paper presents a task assignment method for multi-agents-based collaborative sweep covering, where it is relevant to follow the optimal route in order to maximize the expected results with the available resources and constraints. The designed solution uses a smart planner, which computes optimal routes, and a centralized scheduler that assigns tasks to unmanned robots according to different priority queues. The prototype implementation integrates off-the-shelf IoT technologies to drive a simple robot in a controlled environment. Image processing technologies are used either to estimate in advance the expected reward for the planned route and afterward to get a feedback about the task execution.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntrusion detection systems (IDSs) that continuously monitor data flow and take swift action when attacks are identified safeguard networks. Conventional IDS exhibit limitations, such as reduced detection rates and increased computational complexity, attributed to the redundancy and substantial correlation of network data. Ensemble learning (EL) is effective for detecting network attacks. Nonetheless, network traffic data and memory space requirements are typically significant. Therefore, deploying the EL approach on Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with limited memory is challenging. In this paper, we use feature importance (FI), a filter-based feature selection technique for feature dimensionality reduction, to reduce the feature dimensions of an IoT/IIoT network traffic dataset. We also employ lightweight stacking ensemble learning (SEL) to appropriately identify network traffic records and analyse the reduced features after applying FI to the dataset. Extensive experiments use the Edge-IIoTset dataset containing IoT and IIoT network records. We show that FI reduces the storage space needed to store comprehensive network traffic data by 86.9%, leading to a significant decrease in training and testing time. Regarding accuracy, precision, recall, training and test time, our classifier that utilised the eight best dataset features recorded 87.37%, 90.65%, 77.73%, 80.88%, 16.18 s and 0.10 s for its overall performance. Despite the reduced features, our proposed SEL classifier shows insignificant accuracy compromise. Finally, we pioneered the explanation of SEL by using a decision tree to analyse its performance gain against single learners.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWe are witnessing an explosion in the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) as smart objects become more important in our daily lives to make it easier to achieve our goals. It is obvious that the application areas of IoT are extremely diverse. Indeed, several sectors will be deeply impacted by IoT applications. Of which, security in the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a major concern due to increasing vulnerabilities and threats. Connected devices, often with limited security capabilities, have become attractive targets for attackers. Vulnerabilities in IoT devices, whether resulting from unmodified default configurations, lack of regular updates, or insecure communication protocols, expose these systems to potential risks. Cryptography, as a discipline dedicated to securing communications, uses advanced mathematical techniques to guarantee the confidentiality of electronic exchanges by making the data incomprehensible to unauthorized persons.\nIn this paper, we show an in-depth exploration of the generation of new S-boxes using the genetic algorithm. These new S-boxes are dynamically generated with the new genetic algorithm-based approach. This new method offers adaptive optimization, iteratively exploring the solution space to identify robust S-boxes, thereby strengthening the security of the encryption system. The study continues with the evaluation of these S-boxes through dedicated metrics, allowing an in-depth analysis of their performance in terms of resistance to cryptographic attacks and preservation of substitution properties. Finally, this evaluation extends to the incorporation of these newly generated S-boxes into the AES encryption algorithm, where different dimensions, such as cryptanalysis resistance, scene visibility, and other performance levels, will be examined.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is vulnerable to data-tampering (DT) attacks. Due to resource limitations, many anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for IoT have high false positive rates when detecting DT attacks. This leads to the misreporting of normal data, which will impact the normal operation of IoT. To mitigate the impact caused by the high false positive rate of ADS, this paper proposes an ADS management scheme for clustered IoT. First, we model the data transmission and anomaly detection in clustered IoT. Then, the operation strategy of the clustered IoT is formulated as the running probabilities of all ADSs deployed on every IoT device. In the presence of a high false positive rate in ADSs, to deal with the trade-off between the security and availability of data, we develop a linear programming model referred to as a security trade-off (ST) model. Next, we develop an analysis framework for the ST model, and solve the ST model on an IoT simulation platform. Last, we reveal the effect of some factors on the maximum combined detection rate through theoretical analysis. Simulations show that the ADS management scheme can mitigate the data unavailability loss caused by the high false positive rates in ADS.",

This highlights the critical need for reliable and multi-functional power solutions. To provide a portable charging solution across diverse sectors, this paper proposes an innovative development of a solar-powered multi-functional portable charging device (SPMFPCD) with internet- of-thing (IoT)-based monitoring capabilities. The proposed scheme introduces a comprehensive model integrating advanced technologies which include a highly efficient solar panel, charge controller, sensors, and IoT module. The proposed system facilitates versatile charging solutions for a wide range of power requirements with real-time monitoring and data analysis through the IoT platform. Moreover, the proposed work explores the applications of the SPMFPCD in (1) emergency medical scenarios, (2) outdoor adventures, (3) disaster management, and 4) public spaces. Performance evaluation was made by proposing case studies to validate the (1) economic viability, (2) power management, and (3) environmental impact of widespread deployment of SPMPFCD in public spaces.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe efficient and timely execution of tasks is a fundamental challenge in the realm of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To address this challenge, fog devices are often deployed close to end devices to facilitate task processing on behalf of IoT nodes. One strategy for improving task computational delay is to employ parallel task offloading, in which tasks are subdivided into subtasks and sent to different fog devices for execution in parallel. However, allocating computational resources to fog nodes and mapping these resources to IoT subtasks is a key challenge in this area. This work models the parallel task offloading problem as a graph-matching problem and utilizes a many-to-many matching technique to achieve a stable mapping of IoT subtasks to fog node resources. Unfortunately, the proposed solution is subject to the problem of externalities due to the dynamic preference profiling of fog nodes. To address this issue, we employ an iterative algorithm to resolve any blocking pairs that may arise. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique reduces the task latency by 29% as compared to other matching-based techniques available in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nAn intelligent irrigation management system using new technology.\nâ¢\nThree-tier architecture comprising 1) IoT devices, 2) ThingsBoard cloud, and 3) dashboard.\nâ¢\nTransmission of telemetry data via HTTP protocol to ThingsBoard.\nâ¢\nVisualize and analyze the data in real-time on ThingsBoard.\nâ¢\nEmail notifications to alert farm owners for improved food safety.\nAbstract\nAgriculture, the key sector for food production, faces challenges exacerbated by the growing global demand for food and the scarcity of water resources. Traditional irrigation methods often lead to inefficient use of water, resulting in wastage. Moreover, unpredictable weather conditions and the need to adopt sustainable farming practices are driving us to develop advanced irrigation systems. This paper proposed a smart irrigation management system using new technology like 1) embedded systems, 2) Internet of Things (IoT), 3) telemetry data, 4) cloud computing, communication protocol, and 5) sensors to collect and process real-time data of the smart agriculture. This new technology and intelligent algorithm are used in this paper to improve agricultural practices. The architecture of the proposed scheme comprises three layers: 1) IoT devices, 2) ThingsBoard cloud, and 3) the dashboard, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring seamless data flow, secure communication, and enhanced user interaction. The algorithm orchestrates system operations, incorporating sensor data reading, JavaScript Object Syntax (JSON) payload creation, and secure telemetry data transmission via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol to the ThingsBoard cloud. Pump activation decisions are governed by predefined thresholds, preventing an over-irrigation system. The evaluation of system performance involves deploying temperature, humidity, moisture, and water level sensors in a testing field. Further, before data is sent to the cloud, sensor values are calibrated using a functional map. Tests carried out with temperature, humidity, and water level sensors demonstrate the system's dynamic efficiency. By visualizing and analyzing environmental information via ThingsBoard, the results provide real-time data on environmental parameters of the system proposed, improving the efficiency of water use and the sustainability of farming practices. In addition, the system features e-mail notifications for alerts. The integration of e-mail notifications reinforces monitoring and management practices by alerting farm owners and users. This study showcases the efficacy of the proposed paper in enhancing sustainability, water usage, and supporting smart agriculture practices. Further, this paper integrates embedded systems, IoT, cloud computing, and advanced algorithms to optimize and enhance crop productivity and contribute to global food and water security.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (442KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Data science is the science of dealing with data and its relationships through intelligent approaches. Most of the state-of-the-art focus is on the topic independently, either on data science or IIoT. Therefore, to address the gap, this article provides a comprehensive survey on the advances and integration of data science with the Intelligent IoT (IIoT) system by classifying the existing IoT-based data science techniques and presenting a summary of various characteristics. The paper analyzes the data science or big data security and privacy features, including network architecture, data protection, and continuous monitoring of data, which face challenges in various IoT-based systems. Extensive insights into IoT data security, privacy, and challenges are visualized in the context of data science for IoT. In addition, this study reveals the current opportunities to enhance data science and IoT market development. The current gap and challenges faced in the integration of data science and IoT are comprehensively presented, followed by the future outlook and possible solutions to the existing challenges.",

Hence, building a trusted environment in the IoT and fog layers is very important. There is no assurance that the generated data or task is standard data; it may also have abnormal data to modify its originality. Similarly, the nodes in the fog environment also have malicious nodes during task offloading. For this, the novel Two-way IoT data & Fog Trust management (TwI-FTM) algorithm is proposed to identify the abnormal data with the help of the Trusted Data Measurement (TDM) and Fog Access Trust Evaluation (FATE) method for identifying the malicious fog access nodes in fog network. Identifying these abnormal data and malicious fog access nodes is done by continuously monitoring fog control nodes with the threshold level. Once it is identified, they will automatically be removed from the IoT-FoG network. The obtained trust measurements are analyzed and compared with other existing methods; it is identified that the proposed TwI-FTM outperforms and has a higher trust degree of 0.68 compared with others. It achieved higher detection accuracy of malicious fog access nodes in fog networks at 21 %, 16 %, and 14 % compared with OTM, TTM, and SLA-Trust, respectively. Finally, the task completion time was also reduced, and it was achieved at 4.5 ms, 5 ms, and 13 ms compared with TTM, OTM, and SLA-Trust, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWildfires are a significant natural hazard, resulting in financial losses, human deaths, and environmental damage. Due to the rising severity and frequency of wildfires, wildfire management and detection have recently received increased attention worldwide. Monitoring potential risk areas and early fire detection are critical factors for shortening the reaction time and reducing the potential damage. Conventional wildfire detection techniques like satellite imaging and remote camera-based sensing need more latency and low reliability. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel airborne UAV-based IoT (UIoT) system for wildfire sensing, detection, and extinguishing. It presents the design of low-cost and low-maintenance fire-detecting IoT nodes for large-scale deployment. It also proposes, investigates, and reports on several connectivity architectures using the LoRaWAN protocol for UIoT systems. We geolocate forest trees in a terrain-mapping exercise for precise fire localization. We then deploy an autonomous drone with a visual camera that utilizes our novel classification network to detect the presence of fire followed by fire detection and particle filter-based tracking to center fire at the center of the frame. We use a cloud back-end server for monitoring, analysis, and reporting. Our results show that our low-cost and long-range IoT nodes accurately detect fire within 1-5 min after fire ignition. Our fire classification network achieved an accuracy of 99.46% and a mean average precision of 99.64%. Numerical results suggest that the proposed UAV-IoT-based fire classification offers a fast and reliable wildfire recognition and extinguishing solution while minimizing power consumption and increasing the battery lifespan.",

Although Human Activity Recognition (HAR) algorithms have shown potential in monitoring and evaluating performance, most existing studies focus on daily activities and have difficulty distinguishing complex firefighting tasks. This study introduces the Internet of things (IoT)-based wearable firefighting activity recognition (IoT-FAR) system which employs a multi-modal sensor fusion approach to achieve comprehensive activity recognition during firefighting training. The IoT-FAR comprises five wearable body sensor nodes and a coordinator node. This study explores the significance of features extracted from the surface electromyography, heart rate, and inertial measurement units in firefighting training activity recognition. A hybrid machine learning (HML)-based network is proposed, which integrates three models: one trained with all features (MA), another with upper body features (MU), and a third with lower body features (ML). The proposed HML-SVM-RBF1-RF2 network achieves superior performance, with a mean recall of 93.94%, mean precision of 90.94%, and a mean accuracy rate of 98.29%. Additionally, the study introduces the specialized firefighting training associated activities (SFTAA) dataset, which includes endurance training activities involving self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) conducted by eighteen firefighters. This dataset represents preliminary work towards building a comprehensive dataset covering various events and scenarios for tracking firefighter activities. The IoT-FAR system also demonstrates the potential use of misclassified activities as evaluation metrics for assessing firefighter training performance.",

This paper introduces a new concept of a fire detection system with the use of the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, which can be applied to intelligent agriculture. The approach has also been expanded to the Internet of Things (IoT) for good and timely management. The architecture will involve smoke and flame detection sensors; the major monitoring parameters will include processor utilization, memory consumption, temperature level, and fire status. It will allow real-time communication with data agglomeration through MQTT Broker and clients, including MQTT Explorer. The MQTT publish-subscribe architecture has four main components: the (1) publisher, the (2) subscriber, the (3) broker, and the (4) topic. Besides that, it will also have a model of Publisher/Subscriber in order to enhance the efficiency of sensor data transfer with clients, thus allowing general effectiveness. Most importantly, in the proposed system, a Raspberry Pi 3 demonstrated quite effective real-time fire incident detection. Hence, from the discussion above, our main results relate to fast and reliable fire detection in smart agriculture by using an MQTT-based Publish/Subscribe architecture. Implementation on a Raspberry Pi 3 optimizes resource utilization, including efficient management of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and temperature. The results obtained highlight the superiority of this study, with a detection accuracy of 98.77%, a precision of 97.22%, a recall of 100%, an F1 score of 98.43%, and an average response time of just 2 seconds, which is better than other state-of-the-art methods. These performances attest not only to the effectiveness of this solution but also to its competitive advantage over current studies. These results demonstrate the system's effectiveness for fire detection and its positive impact on the sustainability and safety of smart farming. This successful application highlights the effectiveness of the MQTT protocol in agricultural settings and contributes to the sector's sustainability and food safety by ensuring rapid incident response. The study underscores the transformative potential of IoT and MQTT in advancing fire risk management in agriculture, paving the way for future innovations toward more resilient agricultural practices.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (229KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Executing processes related to healthcare domain in a trusted, secure, efficient, accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and negatively impact health outcomes. To cope with such issues, blockchain technology, combined with the Internet of Things (IoT), can offers a reliable way to track and trace products and protect medical data though a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger. Hence, this paper proposes an IoT-driven blockchain-based architecture to manage the healthcare supply chain and protect medical records from tampering and access violation. Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain, has been adopted due to the sensitive and private nature of the collected data. The envisioned network has been implemented and performance has been evaluated in terms of execution time, resources consumption and throughput.",

These characteristics of IOT are consistent with those of the complex network. Motivated by this, this paper comprehends the security issue of IOT from the sight of the observability of complex network and regards the ability of reconstruction as a security threat to IOT network. We try to identify the minimum vertices whose data could reconstruct the whole data of network, in other words, we need to implement additional protective measures on these vertices to enhance the security of IOT network. By analyzing the topology of IOT network, an identification strategy is adopted and the corresponding algorithm is proposed to identify the minimum protection vertices.",

As a result, proper plan and technological breakthroughs shall be necessary to solve the food shortage. Tomato is a kind of vegetable which has the healthy ingredients and essential for our daily food supply. The proposed system suggests an IoT based tomato cultivation and pest management system, with the help of learning methods. In the IoT implementation, camera module and moisture sensor are used to collect images of tomato plant and soil condition, respectively. Based on the moisture content, the water pump will supply the water necessary for crop growth. Besides, the real-time images of tomato leaves will be sent to the server to identify and classify natural enemies like various insect species. In the proposed system seven types of pests are identified with the help of 10 learning models like InceptionV3, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Large, MobileNetV3Small, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201. This study has trained with leaves and insects separately to identify whether or not an image from a tomato plant is insectoid 458 images of pests and 912 images of leaves are utilized in the proposed architecture. The accuracy of classifying insects or leaves using DenseNet201 is 100 %. The highest accuracy of 94 % is obtained to classify the different insects using the DenseNet201 model.",

In this study, a system was proposed that continuously analyzes biofloc regulating parameters, such as temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), potential of hydrogen (pH), turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and water level, to maintain the ideal circumstances for biofloc. An Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled platform was implemented to collect and analyze real-time data from sensors, including the DS18B20 water temperature, pH-4502C, analog dissolved oxygen, analog total dissolved solids, and water level sensors. The experiment was conducted with mono-sex Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The ESP32 microcontroller utilized Wi-Fi to process sensor data, enabling real-time data analysis on mobile and computer devices through the Blynk application. The study was done as per designated conditions, and that led to the average value of temperature around 27Â±1 Â°C, DO around 6 Â± 0.5 mg/l, TDS around 500 ppm, and the pH level was nearly 7.7 Â± 0.5. If the temperature, water level, or dissolved oxygen changed from the expected value, it sent a signal to the Blynk. This signal then autonomously operated a relay to activate or deactivate the water heater, pump, and air pump to maintain an effective operating condition. Hence, IoT-enabled monitoring systems can have a crucial impact on managing the biofloc throughout the year and enhancing the aquaculture industry in Bangladesh.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (383KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Supply chain digitalization improves transparency, speed, and cost-effectiveness, increasing tech adoptionâtransportation benefits from IoT-driven shipment tracking and web data storage. However, cyber threats target IoT data by exploiting cyber vulnerabilities. Although ML/DL approaches have showed potential in finding IoT vulnerabilities, the difficulty of selecting appropriate features remains. Existing research has produced surprising outcomes, and deep neural networks have been utilised to extract characteristics without taking sequence information into account. To address this, the paper presents a unique approach for accurate IoT vulnerability identification that combines deep learning and better feature selection. On the BoT-IoT dataset, the LSTM + CNN model achieved 95.73 % accuracy. This approach has the ability to successfully anticipate IoT based vulnerabilities by leveraging benchmark data, selecting relevant features, and enhancing overall system performance.",

To address these issues, this paper introduces the V-Track system, a decentralized architecture using blockchain technology for reliable vehicle location verification. By integrating GPS devices (SparkFun GPS NEO-M9), IoT-enabled sensors, and a Cosmos blockchain-based ledger (network of interconnected blockchains), V-Track aims to solve centralized LBS problems. Through rigorous simulation experiments, this paper evaluates the performance and security of the V-Track system and demonstrates its potential to provide reliable location verification while preserving user privacy. This paper makes significant contributions by presenting V-Track as a decentralized solution to centralized LBS privacy and security problems, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness through blockchain integration, improving tracking mechanisms with GPS devices and IoT sensors for improved accuracy, and providing a privacy-preserving alternative to centralized LBS through its decentralized design and use of blockchain technology.

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nNovel IoT-based system for real-time air quality monitoring in chrome plating industry.\nâ¢\nIoT sensors monitor pollutants like NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10.\nâ¢\nAI models (LSTM, Random Forest, Linear Regression) predict pollution levels accurately.\nâ¢\nSystem activates exhaust fans based on predicted pollution, preventing hazards.\nâ¢\nLSTM model achieved 99â¯% RÂ² and 0.33 MAE for temperature and humidity forecasting.\nAbstract\nAir pollution in industrial environments, particularly in the chrome plating process, poses significant health risks to workers due to high concentrations of hazardous pollutants. Exposure to substances like hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory problems and lung cancer. Continuous monitoring and timely intervention are crucial to mitigate these risks. Traditional air quality monitoring methods often lack real-time data analysis and predictive capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in addressing pollution hazards proactively. This paper introduces a real-time air pollution monitoring and forecasting system specifically designed for the chrome plating industry. The system, supported by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and AI approaches, detects a wide range of air pollutants, including NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10, and provides real-time data on pollutant concentration levels. Data collected by the sensors are processed using LSTM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models to predict pollution levels. The LSTM model achieved a coefficient of variation (RÂ²) of 99â¯% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAE) of 0.33 for temperature and humidity forecasting. For PM2.5, the Random Forest model outperformed others, achieving an RÂ² of 84â¯% and an MAE of 10.11. The system activates factory exhaust fans to circulate air when high pollution levels are predicted to occur in the next hours, allowing for proactive measures to improve air quality before issues arise. This innovative approach demonstrates significant advancements in industrial environmental monitoring, enabling dynamic responses to pollution and improving air quality in industrial settings.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning enables data owners in the Internet of Things (IoT) to collaborate in training models without sharing private data, creating new business opportunities for building a data market. However, in practical operation, there are still some problems with federated learning applications. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, distribution, and security. The blockchain-enabled federated learning further improve the security and performance of model training, while also expanding the application scope of federated learning. Blockchain has natural financial attributes that help establish a federated learning data market. However, the data of federated learning tasks may be distributed across a large number of resource-constrained IoT devices, which have different computing, communication, and storage resources, and the data quality of each device may also vary. Therefore, how to effectively select the clients with the data required for federated learning task is a research hotspot. In this paper, a two-stage client selection scheme for blockchain-enabled federated learning is proposed, which first selects clients that satisfy federated learning task through attribute-based encryption, protecting the attribute privacy of clients. Then blockchain nodes select some clients for local model aggregation by proximal policy optimization algorithm. Experiments show that the model performance of our two-stage client selection scheme is higher than that of other client selection algorithms when some clients are offline and the data quality is poor.",

As IoT botnets evolve, their dynamic and multifaceted nature hampers conventional detection methods. This paper proposes a risk assessment framework based on fuzzy logic and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the risks associated with IoT botnets. Fuzzy logic addresses IoT threat uncertainties and ambiguities methodically. Fuzzy component settings are optimized using PSO to improve accuracy. The methodology allows for more complex thinking by transitioning from binary to continuous assessment. Instead of expert inputs, PSO data-driven tunes rules and membership functions. This study presents a complete IoT botnet risk assessment system. The methodology helps security teams allocate resources by categorizing threats as high, medium, or low severity. This study shows how CICIoT2023 can assess cyber risks.

In the event that any health-related measure deviates from the normal range, this system, which is based on IoT technology, will send a notification to the user. The data collected by this system is sent to an analysis system based on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) through a mobile application, and then transferred to the cloud for storage. To display this raw data, a wearable IoT device can be utilized, and the system will process the data accordingly. The major innovation of this proposed project lies in the development of a fuzzy classifier that can accurately predict the pathological condition of an illness. By implementing a fuzzy classifier using FPGA, the execution time is greatly reduced i.e. 57.7Î¼s compared to other algorithms. Ans also the accuracy of the proposed model is 98.8 %, which higher then other machine learning model such as 97 %, 96.5 %, 93.2 % respectively for SVM, KNN and DT models.\nprevious models like KNN, DT, SVM, and NB (Naive Bayes).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe significance of koalas to Australia extends beyond their iconic status, with the industry surrounding them valued at $3.2 billion and providing employment for 30,000 individuals. Ever increasing pressures from urbanisation, land clearing, disease, bushfires and the spread of non-native vegetation and predators have resulted in the continual deterioration in natural koala populations. Effective monitoring and protection of koalas (and their habitat) is critical in reversing this decline. Of particular concern is how to manage koalas at the urban interface â especially with regard to koalas navigating structures such as roads and motorways. While there exist numerous types of infrastructure and strategies to theoretically allow safe passage of koalas between habitat that is divided by road networks, there is limited data on the known effectiveness of these approaches. Part of the problem lies in the ability to detect, monitor and report on the numbers of koalas in the area and their traversal behaviours. Unfortunately, strategies that rely on human observation are piecemeal, and using koala injury/fatalities statistics on roads is not an ideal approach. This paper presents a computer vision enhanced IoT koala monitoring and recognition system that can be used to detect koalas in their native surroundings non-intrusively. The cameras are deployed in places of interest near fauna road crossings. Motion sensing triggers the cameras to take several seconds of video footage that is relayed to the Cloud. Machine learning algorithms process the video footage to determine whether a koala has been spotted. Experimental results demonstrate that our best model on YOLO8 achieve 97.5 AP, 96.5 AR, 99.2 mAP@50, and 97.1 mAP@50-95 in our dataset which contains both daytime and night-time images. Relevant conservation groups and stakeholders can then use our outcomes to target their koala protection strategies accordingly. The system has now been used in multiple koala conservation initiatives. This paper outlines the system including hardware and the image processing approach, deployments for different koala management programs, challenges faced/overcome (technical, practical and logistical), and possibilities for future directions to enhance the technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nEdgeâcloud coordination offers the chance to mitigate the enormous storage and processing load brought on by a massive increase in traffic at the networkâs edge. Though this paradigm has benefits on a large scale, outsourcing the sensitive data from the smart devices deployed in an Internet of Things (IoT) application may lead to privacy leakage. With an attribute-based keyword search (ABKS), the search over ciphertext can be achieved; this reduces the risk of sensitive data explosion. However, ABKS has several issues, like huge computational overhead to perform multi-keyword searches and tracing malicious users. To address these issues and enhance the performance of ABKS, we propose a novel traceable and lightweight attribute-based keyword search technique in an Edgeâcloud-assisted IoT, named TL-ABKS, using edgeâcloud coordination. With TL-ABKS, it is possible to do effective multi-keyword searches and implement fine-grained access control. Further, TL-ABKS outsources the encryption and decryption computation to edge nodes to enable its usage to resource-limited IoT smart devices. In addition, TL-ABKS achieves tracing user identity who misuse their secret keys. TL-ABKS is secure against modified secret keys, chosen plaintext, and chosen keyword attacks. By comparing the proposed TL-ABKS with the current state-of-the-art schemes, and conducting a theoretical and experimental evaluation of its performance and credibility, TL-ABKS is efficient.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nInnovative IoT architectures for semantic interoperability using inverted- and federated-fog computing.\nâ¢\nEvaluated resource consumption and latency times on cloud, fog, inverted- and federated-fog computing\nâ¢\nFederated IoT architectures balance resource consumption and latency for real-time, semantic interoperability\nâ¢\nBalancing data distribution, these architectures maximise scalability, reliability,\nAbstract\nIn contemporary computing paradigms, the evolution from cloud computing to fog computing and the recent emergence of federated-fog computing have introduced new challenges pertaining to semantic interoperability, particularly in the context of real-time applications. Fog computing, by shifting computational processes closer to the network edge at the local area network level, aims to mitigate latency and enhance efficiency by minimising data transfers to the cloud. Building upon this, federated-fog computing extends the paradigm by distributing computing resources across diverse organisations and locations, while maintaining centralised management and control. This research article addresses the inherent problematics in achieving semantic interoperability within the evolving architectures of cloud computing, fog computing, and federated-fog computing. Experimental investigations are conducted on a diverse node-based testbed, simulating various end-user devices, to emphasise the critical role of semantic interoperability in facilitating seamless data exchange and integration. Furthermore, the efficacy of federated-fog computing is rigorously evaluated in comparison to traditional fog and cloud computing frameworks. Specifically, the assessment focuses on critical factors such as latency time and computational resource utilisation while processing real-time data streams generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The findings of this study underscore the advantages of federated-fog computing over conventional cloud and fog computing paradigms, particularly in the realm of real-time IoT applications demanding high performance (lowering CPU usage to 20%) and low latency (with picks up to 300ms). The research contributes valuable insights into the optimisation of processing architectures for contemporary computing paradigms, offering implications for the advancement of semantic interoperability in the context of emerging federated-fog computing for IoT applications.",

Aimed at scrutinizing the link-level performance and reliability of LoRa technology, extensive measurements have been conducted with prototype device integrating the SX1278 LoRa radio module at 433 MHz. The performance has been analysed in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and Packet Reception Rate (PRR) across various line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. The results reveal that network performance is highly sensitive to parameter configurations, such as spreading factor (SF) and coding rate (CR). In LoS environments, SF = 9 and CR = 4/5 provided an RSSI of â89.12 dBm and an SNR of 9.91 dB, while highly obstructive areas saw optimal performance with SF = 7 and CR = 4/7. The study also identified configurations ensuring 100 % packet delivery accuracy and maximum throughput. This work stands out due to its thorough examination of LoRa for indoor IoT applications, notably addressing duty cycle restrictions, a topic often overlooked in existing literature. The valuable insights presented are crucial for maximizing the potential of LoRa in indoor environments with high population density. The findings strongly advocate for the use of LoRa for real-time environmental monitoring and innovative IoT applications within university campuses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is widely deployed and brings great opportunities to change people's daily life. To realize more effective human-computer interaction in the IoT applications, the Question Answering (QA) systems implanted in the IoT services are supposed to improve the ability to understand natural language. Therefore, the distributed representation of words, which contains more semantic or syntactic information, has been playing a more and more important role in the QA systems. However, learning high-quality distributed word vectors requires lots of storage and computing resources, hence it cannot be deployed on the resource-constrained IoT devices. It is a good choice to outsource the data and computation to the cloud servers. Nevertheless, it could cause privacy risks to directly upload private data to the untrusted cloud. Therefore, realizing the word vector learning process over untrusted cloud servers without privacy leakage is an urgent and challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel efficient word vector learning scheme over encrypted data. We first design a series of arithmetic computation protocols. Then we use two non-colluding cloud servers to implement high-quality word vectors learning over encrypted data. The proposed scheme allows us to perform training word vectors on the remote cloud servers while protecting privacy. Security analysis and experiments over real data sets demonstrate that our scheme is more secure and efficient than existing privacy-preserving word vector learning schemes.",

Lithium-ion (Li-ion)-based Battery Energy storage (BES) is a prominent approach that is widely adopted for managing large-scale renewable energy generation. Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a critical role in optimizing battery performance of BES by monitoring parameters such as overcharging, the state of health (SoH), cell protection, real-time data, and fault detection to ensure reliability. Previous studies have concluded that the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) with LoRa ensures effective real-time monitoring of the BMS of Li-ion batteries. This study proposed and implemented a customized LoRa and IoT-based hardware system with a gateway to acquire parameters such as terminal voltage, current, charge voltage, charge current, cycle, temperature, state of charge (SoC), and SoH, and log them into the cloud server. An OMnet++-based Framework for LoRa (FLoRa) simulation was implemented to analyze the power consumption and residual energy of the customized LoRa nodes. The simulation was configured with a spread factor of 7, a carrier frequency of 433 MHz, a bandwidth of 125 KHz, and a transmission power of 2 dBm. The simulation results indicated that Node 3 had the highest mean power consumption (0.028233) and total energy consumption (0.146592), whereas Node 0 exhibited the lowest mean power consumption (0.023413) and total energy consumption (0.070204). Additionally, a comprehensive dataset encompassing voltage, current, and time was created and utilized for precise calculations of the battery's capacity and state of health, with potential use in future predictions.",

Four experimental setups in 2 x 6 meter greenhouses with 1.2-meter high planting shelves were tested, comprising 1) combined light and temperature control, 2) temperature control, 3) light control, and 4) natural conditions. A 45-day experiment was conducted under equal electrical conductivity (EC) and pH levels across all greenhouses. Light control utilized artificial light at a wavelength of 660 nm from 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM, while temperature control employed a misting system activated when temperatures exceeded 35Â°C. Data collected every 5-7 days were analyzed using the Friedman test. The fully controlled greenhouse yielded 13.91% more than natural conditions, 30.3 kg vs 26.6 kg, with significant weight differences (ÏÂ² = 8.850, p < 0.05) approximately 25 days after planting. Economic analysis revealed that the controlled greenhouse yielded the highest net profit of 750.18 USD per year with a 13-month payback period, whereas the natural conditions greenhouse demonstrated the highest return on investment (ROI) of 131.00% and the shortest payback period of 9 months, despite producing the lowest yield. The results demonstrate that IoT-controlled environments can significantly increase crop yields, though economic viability may vary.",

Despite advancements in stitch strain sensors, there is a significant research gap in developing high-performance, stable, and IoT-connected complete stitch strain wearable sensor systems. These advanced sensors are essential for enhancing wearable technology and meeting the growing demands for improved user experience and functionality. In this study by utilizing conductive sewing threads and innovative stitching techniques, we fabricated textile strain sensors that offer high sensitivity, flexibility, and durability. Extensive calibration tests revealed strong linear relationships between resistance and tensile strain, with highest sensor sensitivity (2.08 Î©/mm during loading and 2.72 Î©/mm during unloading). These sensors demonstrate reliable performance with minimal hysteresis, particularly in shorter lengths. The wearable sportswear device, tested in gym environments, demonstrated the sensor's capability to provide real-time feedback on knee flexing/bending and body movement during exercise. This functionality supports injury prevention and enhances workout efficiency. The sensor system is IoT-enabled, powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller, facilitating data transmission to the Thing Speak platform for advanced analysis and remote monitoring. This comprehensive approach not only advances wearable technology but also opens new avenues for remote health monitoring and smart e-textiles, contributing significantly to the fields of sports science and fitness technology.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (452KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Despite its potential, the adoption of IoT technology in agriculture remains generally low. Hence, this research aims to explore the motivating factors influencing IoT adoption, assess the impacts of adoption on agriculturists, and identify the challenges that need to be addressed to promote future IoT adoption in the agricultural sector. Semi-structured interviews with Norwegian agriculturists who have adopted IoT technologies were conducted using an exploratory qualitative approach. Our findings reveal several key factors that influence IoT adoption, including the availability of technical support, governmental policies, and the intentions of agriculturistsâ children to carry on farming traditions. The adoption of IoT has led to improved decision-making, operational efficiency, and control for agriculturists, although they may not be fully aware of all the consequences associated with adoption. Additionally, the study highlights a lack of support and knowledge among industry stakeholders, which could hinder the diffusion of IoT adoption in agriculture. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complexities surrounding IoT adoption in agriculture and provide insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and agriculturists seeking to maximize the benefits of IoT technology. Addressing the challenges identified, such as enhancing technical support systems, developing supportive policies, and increasing awareness among agriculturists, can foster a conducive environment for greater IoT adoption in agriculture in Norway.",

Regulations such as the Consumer Data Rights (CDR) highlight the need for the seamless sharing of sensitive data with authorized third parties while ensuring confidentiality and privacy. To enable such secure sharing, a data storage and sharing scheme should fulfill the following core requirements: (a) support multi-client data sharing settings, allowing IoT data owners to authorize multiple clients; (b) a dynamic storage environment permitting IoT owners to add or remove files with minimal privacy leak; (c) decentralized storage for distributing data across servers or Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for greater security; and (d) efficient privilege revocation mechanism which incurs less computation and communication overhead. To address these requirements, we have proposed a novel keyword search scheme using computationally lightweight cryptographic primitives. Our scheme empowers IoT data owners to securely share, store and manage encrypted data in the CSPs, providing better security and privacy. We have provided formal security proof for our scheme as well as validated its efficiency via extensive experiments on the Docker platform. On a database of 12 million keyword/document pairs (with\ndocuments and\nkeywords), our scheme took about 18 ms to return all matched documents.",

Low-loss Rogers RT-5880 substrate material has been utilized to achieve higher efficiency, gain, and diversity performance in a relatively compact size. The unit element planar monopole antenna has been designed within\nwith a partial ground. Four unit-element antennas were orthogonally arranged on alternating sides of the substrate plane with narrow inter-component spacing in the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The integration of the double negative (DNG) metamaterial array on the antenna led to a cumulative improvement in the overall performance of the antenna, which includes gain, efficiency, and isolation. The minimum isolation of the antenna increased by 11 dB with substrate-loaded metamaterial. The proposed MIMO antenna model with substrate-loaded metamaterial demonstrates 8 GHz instantaneous bandwidth (33.1 GHz - 41.1 GHz), 0.001 envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), diversity gain (DG) greater than 9.99 dB, channel capacity loss (CCL) less than\n, and a total active reflection coefficient (TARC) of 25 dB, which suggests that the diversity characteristics of the MIMO antenna system is impressive. Moreover, a densely packed 12-element antenna model has been introduced in this study with\npattern diversity, capable of receiving signals from any direction. Three 4-element MIMO systems have been arranged in an architecture to develop the 12-element MIMO system, and the size of the 12-element MIMO architecture is\n. Despite having this compact size and dense packing, the 12-element MIMO antenna model shows similar diversity performance as the 4-element antenna model.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAt present, Internet of Things devices are revolutionizing and impacting increasingly more areas of our daily lives. However, there remain doubts related to the lack of sufficient security in the IoT ecosystem. As such devices have limitations in terms of resources such as computational power and batteries, adding security mechanisms is often perceived as an unnecessary burden, slowing the further expansion of IoT-based solutions and applications.\nIn this study, an investigation is conducted to verify the possibility of applying security measures such as strong encryption without hindering the performance of IoT devices. This factor is especially important from the perspective of the European project SILVANUS, in which various IoT application scenarios are envisioned. Taking into account the above, in this work, an extensive experimental performance evaluation campaign is performed using the DTLS-based encryption of network traffic for two popular boards: Raspberry Pi 4 and STM32 Nucleo. The obtained results demonstrate that the utilization of strong encryption is feasible (with some limitations) on IoT devices, but the resulting performance or battery life is not a reasonable argument anymore to leave IoT ecosystems completely insecure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enriched modern life, but their increasing ubiquity raises concerns about environmental impact. To address this, comprehensive Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) of IoT products, which have historically been manual, costly, and time-consuming, are vital. Noting the recurring nature of core components in IoT devices, such as CPUs and sensors, we propose to use graphs and machine learning to simplify and scale LCA estimations for IoT products. This paper introduces a novel approach to representing IoT devices as graphs with specific component characteristics and interconnections. Applied to a preliminary dataset of smart home IoT devices, the methodology unveils insights into structural similarities using a composite kernel approach. This initial phase lays the groundwork for the machine learning component. The integration of machine learning planned as part of ongoing research, provides a pathway for efficient and timely ecological assessments, ensuring that the rapid growth of IoT aligns with sustainable practices.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nData quality, accuracy, and interoperability are challenges for IoT data sharing.\nâ¢\nAn interoperable framework to enable quality and accurate IoT data sharing.\nâ¢\nA new trust metric is proposed as intrinsic to the shared data.\nâ¢\nA framework that enables the privacy-aware sharing of data.\nâ¢\nEasy integration of multi-source and heterogeneous sensors data.\nAbstract\nSharing Internet of Things (IoT) data across different sectors, such as in smart cities, becomes complex due to heterogeneity. This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fogâedge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity.",

This paper presents the TransVAE-Music composition system to achieve efficient multimodal data perception and fusion. Through the introduction of the Internet of Things technology, the system can collect and process audio, video and other data in real time, and improve the diversity and artistry of music generation. At the same time, the Bayesian optimization mechanism is used to finely adjust the hyperparameters in the system to further improve the model performance. Experimental results show that TransVAE-Music has 1.10 and 1.12 reconstruction errors on the POP909 and FMA datasets, respectively, which significantly outperforms other mainstream automatic music generation models. In addition, the model reached 4.8 and 4.9 in perceived quality score (PQS), and 4.4 and 4.5 in user satisfaction score (USS), respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed system has significant advantages in terms of the accuracy of music generation and the user experience. This study not only provides an effective method for automatic music generation, but also provides important references for future studies on multimodal data fusion and high-quality music generation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe inclusion of IoT in digital platforms is very common nowadays due to the ease of deployment, low power consumption and low cost. It is also common to use heterogeneous IoT devices of ad-hoc or commercial development, using private or third-party network infrastructures. This scenario makes it difficult to detect invalid packets from malfunctioning devices, from sensors to application servers. These invalid packets generate low quality or erroneous data, which negatively influence the services that use them. For this reason, we need to create procedures and mechanisms to ensure the quality of the data obtained from IoT infrastructures, regardless of the type of infrastructure and the control we have over them, so that the systems that use this data can be reliable. In this work we propose the development of an Anomaly Detection System for IoT infrastructures based on Machine Learning using unsupervised learning. We validate the proposal by implementing it on the IoT infrastructure of the University of Alicante, which has a multiple sensing system and uses third-party services, over a campus of one million square meters. The contribution of this work has been the generation of an anomaly detection system capable of revealing incidents in IoT infrastructures, without knowing details about the infrastructures or devices, through the analysis of data in real time. This proposal allows to discard from the IoT data flow all those packets that are suspected to be anomalous to ensure a high quality of information to the tools that consume IoT data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the complex Internet of Things (IoT) environment, a plethora of IoT services with akin functions but varying qualities of service exist. To meet diverse customer needs and drive widespread application, service composition optimization becomes crucial. In the current era of rapid development in artificial intelligence, intelligent algorithms play a significant role in optimizing service composition. However, algorithms applied to IoT service composition optimization face common challenges of low search efficiency and insufficient optimization precision, including the Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Therefore, this study seeks to enhance the perception of service quality in IoT service composition. It proposes an improved SFLA (ISFLA) based on the original SFLA. The algorithm integrates chaos theory and reverse learning theory for the acquisition of the initial population. It utilizes Euclidean distance to partition the population into groups and employs Gaussian mutation to optimize the optimal individual of each group. Finally, the entire population undergoes evolution through a local update method based on two strategies. Simulated experiments were conducted to search for optimal IoT service composition solutions of different scales. The results indicate that, compared to the SFLA, GA, ISFLA*, IGSFLA and SFLAGA, ISFLA achieves superior fitness values, better composition solutions, and exhibits faster convergence, higher stability, and greater overall operational efficiency.",

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) applications benefit greatly from this paradigm, as they need to gather, preprocess, aggregate and analyze data at various scales. In such contexts, the increasing hardware/software resource availability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices provides the opportunity to exploit them not only as data sources in AI/ML infrastructures, but also as computational nodes for model training and inference; nevertheless, comprehensive frameworks are still mostly missing. This work introduces an innovative serverless computing architecture which expands the cloud-to-edge continuum toward IoT devices. The same functions can run on IoT, edge and cloud nodes with minimal to no code modification and they can be invoked through a uniform interface. A federated learning framework is defined based on the proposed architecture, exploiting an existing IoT-oriented ML algorithm in a novel way. Notably, IoT nodes are used for both federated training and local inference tasks. A full prototype implementation has been built with off-the-shelf technologies and devices. A case study on federated machine learning for activity recognition and experiments have been conducted to validate key elements of the proposal.",

The gross domestic output of India is about 15 % derived from its farmers. Crop failure is common among farmers, primarily because of inadequate irrigation techniques and irregular power and water supplies. To begin with, a survey of farmers from various parts of India was undertaken in this regard, and the results indicated that most of them lacked an effective irrigation system. An inventive solar-powered irrigation system devised and deployed to address this problem includes an automated Internet of Things (IoT) system. This IoT system, which functions based on the moisture content of the soil, plays a crucial role in ensuring that the crops receive the right amount of water at the right time. Furthermore, the PV pumping system addresses irrigation issues in various Indian climate conditions, including composite, warm and humid, cold, moderate, hot, and dry. The locations chosen for these climate conditions are Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, Bangalore in Karnataka, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh, Patna in Bihar, and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh. Performance ratios range from 0.514 to 0.739, system and pump efficiencies from 61 % to 88.80 %, and 57.10 %â58.60 %, respectively.",

This paper focuses on their use in dairy farming, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and health monitoring by providing real-time data for decision-making. The paper proposed an IoT-UAV system for cattle health monitoring. The proposed system is one in which IoT sensors on cattle gather health data, which is subsequently sent to UAVs for aerial surveillance and intervention. It evaluates two scenarios: one with 10 cattle and another with 50. Scenario 1 shows UAVs covering a large area with low overlap, while Scenario 2 focuses on close monitoring of cow clusters, with UAVs switching routes due to low energy. The cattle health status varies notably between the two scenarios. In Scenario 1, there's more diversity, with some cattle having higher health statuses around 0.9, while in Scenario 2, most fall into lower ranges, mainly between 0.2 and 0.6, indicating more uniformity. Additionally, UAV energy levels in Scenario 1 show considerable variation, from nearly full to around 20 %, suggesting energy depletion during observation. In Scenario 2, all UAVs maintain energy levels close to 100 %, indicating efficient and less frequent use compared to Scenario 1. Nearest Neighbor response plots show more uniform distances between cattle and UAVs in Scenario 2, where energy levels are considered, unlike in Scenario 1. This suggests a conservative approach to distance coverage, likely to conserve energy by avoiding long-distance travel.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe network of resource constraint devices, also known as the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), constitutes the edge tire of the Internet of Things applications like smart homes, smart cities, and connected vehicles. The IPv6 Routing Protocol over Low power and lossy networks (RPL) ensures efficient routing in the edge tire of the IoT environment. However, RPL has inherent vulnerabilities that allow malicious insider entities to instigate several security attacks in the IoT network. As a result, the IoT networks suffer from resource depletion, performance degradation, and traffic disruption. Recent literature discusses several machine learning algorithms to detect one or more routing attacks. However, IoT infrastructures are expanding, and so are the attack surfaces. Therefore, it is essential to have a solution that can adapt to this change. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to detect routing attacks within Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The proposed solution leverages deep learning by combining Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The framework is trained on 11 network parameters to understand and predict normal network behavior. Anomalies, identified as deviations from the forecast trends, serve as indicators of potential routing attacks and thus address vulnerabilities in the RPL.",

The product class of âsmart relaysâ, which are connected to the low-voltage grid and usually installed in sockets behind walls, has not yet received much attention in the context of smart home forensics. To close a category-specific gap in the device forensics literature, we conducted a multi-device analysis of 16 smart relays from 9 manufacturers, which support six different companion apps in total. Our examination shows that forensic artifacts can be found locally on the smart relays and in the companion app data, as well as remotely on cloud servers of the vendors. Based on our findings, we developed a Python framework to extract forensic artifacts automatically from obtained firmware dumps, from companion app data, and from captured network traffic.",

As a prerequisite for exploiting these benefits in the context of BPM, IoT aspects needs to be explicitly captured in business models. Modeling IoT-driven business processes with BPMN 2.0, however, might be hindered by the ambiguous use of the modeling elements. To tackle this challenge, we have proposed a BPMN 2.0 extension for IoT (BPMNE4IoT) that incorporates specific IoT modeling elements. BPMNE4IoT enables the modeling, execution, monitoring, and recording of IoT-driven business processes. In general, the effectiveness of any BPMN 2.0 extensions depend on its comprehensibility by BPM practitioners. Consequently, user studies are required, which investigate the effects of IoT-specific elements on process model readers. This paper presents the results of such a user study (N=249), which aims to determine whether IoT involvement becomes visually better apparent in our language extension BPMNE4IoT compared to standard BPMN 2.0. In particular, the user study confirms that the involvement of IoT aspects in BPMNE4IoT is more discernible for both experts and non-experts compared to the BPMN 2.0 standard.",

This integration is motivated by the need to solve the specific issues provided by the expansion of IoT and the potential benefits that quantum computing can offer in this scenario. The combination of IoT and quantum computing creates new privacy and security problems. This study examines the critical need to prevent potential security concerns from quantum computing in IoT applications. We investigate the incorporation of quantum computing approaches within IoT security frameworks, with a focus on developing effective security mechanisms. Our research, which uses quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols, provides a unique solution to protecting sensitive information and assuring the integrity of IoT systems. We rigorously analyze critical quantum computing security properties, building a hierarchical framework for systematic examination. We offer concrete solutions flexible to diverse as well as ambiguous opinions through using a unified computational model with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) as the technique for ordering preferences by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy environment. This study adds practical benefit by supporting practitioners in recognizing, choosing, and prioritizing essential security factors from the standpoint of quantum computing. Our approach is a critical step towards improving quantum-level security in IoT systems, strengthening their resilience against future threats, and preserving the IoT ecosystem's long-term prosperity.",

Increasing consumer willingness to return household e-waste is a practical solution for better e-waste management. In this paper, for the first time, a circular supply chain network is structured by applying internet of things (IoT) technology to increase consumer willingness to return household e-waste and to manage the network more effectively. For this purpose, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model whose objective is to minimize strategic costs (setup costs and IoT deployment costs) and operational costs (transportation costs, costs associated with IoT, and processing costs in centers), simultaneously. In addition, we developed a heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation to solve the proposed MILP model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results with GAMS results using eight small-sized simulated problems. Furthermore, eight large-size problems are simulated and solved by the proposed algorithm. Finally, the data of an Iranian knowledge-based company is employed to validate the presented mathematical model and algorithm, and the sensitivity analysis process is used to examine the accuracy of the obtained results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently, the Internet of Things (IoT) generates a huge amount of traffic data in communication and information technology. The diversification and integration of IoT applications and terminals make IoT vulnerable to intrusion attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and security of IoT systems. The detection of intrusion is considered a challenging task because of inappropriate features existing in the input data and the slow training process. In order to address these issues, an effective meta heuristic based feature selection and deep learning techniques are developed for enhancing the IDS. The Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) based feature selection is proposed for selecting the highly informative features from the input which leads to an effective differentiation among the normal and attack traffic of network. Moreover, the traditional sigmoid and tangent activation functions are replaced with the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function to propose the modified Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). The modified Bi-LSTM is used for classifying the types of intrusion attacks. The ELU activation function makes gradients extremely large during back-propagation and leads to faster learning. This research is analysed in three different datasets such as N-BaIoT, Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Dataset 2017 (CICIDS-2017), and ToN-IoT datasets. The empirical investigation states that the proposed framework obtains impressive detection accuracy of 99.98 %, 99.97 % and 99.88 % on the N-BaIoT, CICIDS-2017, and ToN-IoT datasets, respectively. Compared to peer frameworks, this framework obtains high detection accuracy with better interpretability and reduced processing time.",

Typically, thermal comfort is assessed either through surveys completed by building occupants or through sensor data that is analyzed using thermal comfort models. Automating comfort surveys and data collection processes reduce the risk of information loss, providing more accurate and personalized thermal comfort assessments over longer periods of time. To this end, this paper presents the design and implementation of a thermal comfort monitoring system consisting of low-cost hardware components and using IoT technologies. The system consists of intelligent wireless sensor nodes that collect and process environmental data, a portable main station that integrates and stores data, and a digital survey that provides feedback from building occupants. To ensure accuracy, the low-cost hardware components of the intelligent sensor nodes are calibrated in a climate chamber, using high-precision sensors for reference. After calibration, the system is deployed in a field test where several intelligent sensor nodes collect environmental data in an office, while occupants complete the digital thermal comfort survey. In addition, thermal comfort indexes are computed by the intelligent sensor nodes and compared with the feedback of each building occupant. The results indicate that the low-cost thermal comfort monitoring system successfully collects and integrates thermal comfort data from the intelligent sensor nodes and the digital survey, being able to create personalized thermal comfort profiles. In future work, the system can be used in large-scale thermal comfort surveys, to develop personalized thermal comfort models and to control personalized comfort systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the era of the IoT revolution, applications are becoming ever more sophisticated and accompanied by diverse functional and non-functional requirements, including those related to computing resources and performance levels. Such requirements make the development and implementation of these applications complex and challenging. Computing models, such as cloud computing, can provide applications with on-demand computation and storage resources to meet their needs. Although cloud computing is a great enabler for IoT and endpoint devices, its limitations make it unsuitable to fulfill all design goals of novel applications and use cases. Instead of only relying on cloud computing, leveraging and integrating resources at different layers (like IoT, edge, and cloud) is necessary to form and utilize a computing continuum. The layersâ integration in the computing continuum offers a wide range of innovative services, but it introduces new challenges (e.g., monitoring performance and ensuring security) that need to be investigated. A better grasp and more profound understanding of the computing continuum can guide researchers and developers in tackling and overcoming such challenges. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive and unified view of the computing continuum. The paper discusses computing models in general with a focus on cloud computing, the computing models that emerged beyond the cloud, and the communication technologies that enable computing in the continuum. In addition, two novel reference architectures are presented in this work: one for edgeâcloud computing models and the other for edgeâcloud communication technologies. We demonstrate real use cases from different application domains (like industry and science) to validate the proposed reference architectures, and we show how these use cases map onto the reference architectures. Finally, the paper highlights key points that express the authorsâ vision about efficiently enabling and utilizing the computing continuum in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe tractor serves as a crucial power source in agricultural operations. However, the tractor's power often remains underutilized due to a mismatch between the tractor and implement, considering specific field conditions. To enhance system output, it becomes vital to acquire data on performance-related parameters for the tractor-implement combination. In this study we develop a real-time Instrumented Tractor Performance Monitoring System (ITPMS) using the Internet-of-Things (IoT). This system consists of a Raspberry Pi, a GPS sensor, a proximity sensor, a rotary potentiometer, and a three-point hitch dynamometer. The rotary potentiometer measures tillage depth, while the three-point hitch dynamometer used to measure data on draft force. Proximity sensors are installed on a two-wheel drive (2WD) tractor to measure forward speed and drive-wheel slip. We establish a dedicated web server using a GoogleÂ® FirebaseÂ® project to store data from all sensors through Raspberry Pi. Additionally, we design a web interface and a mobile application to provide real-time data generated from the sensors. Field experiments were done to evaluate and monitor the performance parameters of the tractor-implement combination utilising the developed ITPMS. The results demonstrate that the system effectively monitors the performance parameters necessary for tractor-implement combination. Furthermore, the system's capability to update data to the IoT server in real-time is validated. Overall, the development and implementation of this Raspberry Pi based IoT system, provides a reliable and efficient solution for real-time performance monitoring of instrumented tractors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) threat surface refers to the overall susceptibility of smart devices to potential security risks. This vulnerability includes the combined impact of security weaknesses, gaps in protective measures, and potential vulnerabilities within the device OS, installed libraries, and applications, as well as the infrastructure involved. This comprises both identified and unforeseen risks that could potentially compromise the deviceâs integrity, data, logs, and hosted applications. By minimizing the extent to which the deviceâs components are exposed, it becomes possible to reduce the vulnerabilities inherent in the device, thereby decreasing its overall threat surface area. This research introduces an innovative framework for assessing Smart IoT cameras within the ecosystem. This framework involves the identification and categorization of webcam devices, followed by an analysis of potential threats based on various exposure indicators present within each layer. Subsequently, this information is used to determine the possible paths through which a device might be compromised, allowing for the evaluation of severity and both maturity levels. The authors present metrics that aid in reevaluating and recalibrating the security levels, considering the discovered threat surface elements. These refined metrics offer a fresh perspective on security, offering valuable insights for stakeholders who are engaged in the development, deployment, and evaluation of the security aspects of such devices.",

Due to its architecture, IoT-based devices suffer from various security challenges, most commonly, botnet attacks. This article aims to develop a hybrid feature selection method to find the most influential features based on three feature selection methods, correlation, generalized normal distribution optimization, and lasso, to detect botnet attacks in IoT devices. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used to assess the proposed system. Several classification models including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and bagging are utilized for the classification purpose. The proposed system was evaluated using several performance metrics. The results showed the correlation feature selection method had the most accurate botnet attack detection rate. RF also outperformed other models with a 95.11% detection rate in binary classification and 83.96% in multi-classification. On the other hand, results showed that the proposed hybrid method outperformed the feature selection methods with an increase of about 3% in both classifications. The AdaBoost model achieved an accuracy of 99.28% with binary classification by using 18 features, and the RF model achieved an accuracy of 86.62% with multi-classification by using 22 features. The robustness and efficacy of the proposed approach were demonstrated by comparing the study's results with several other studies that have used the same dataset. The results of the study can be implemented in real applications to detect network interference of a dynamic nature in real-time and assist intrusion detection systems (IDS) in addressing these attacks.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nRF and LSTM emerged as the most used ML models to analyze IoT data in the manufacturing operations.\nâ¢\nMost literature focused on Maintenance data, with few studies considering Production data.\nâ¢\nThe concept of Machine Learning Interpretability is an under-explored concept in this field.\nAbstract\nIndustry 4.0 has transformed manufacturing with real-time plant data collection across operations and effective analysis is crucial to unlock the full potential of Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor data, integrating IoT with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). They can provide powerful predictions but anticipating issues is not enough. Manufacturing companies must prioritize avoiding inefficiencies, thereby developing improvement strategies from an Operational Excellence perspective. Here, the interpretability dimension of AI-based models could support a complete understanding of the reasons behind the outcomes, making ML and DL models transparent, and allowing the identification of the causal linkages between the inputs and outputs of the system. Within this context, this study aims first to deliver a comprehensive overview of the existing applications of Advanced Analytics techniques leveraging IoT data in manufacturing environments to then analyze their interpretability implications, referring to the interpretability as the description of the link between the independent and dependent variables in a way that is understandable to humans. Different gaps in terms of lack of full data enhancement are highlighted, providing directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid development of wireless-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks, supported by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and full-duplex technologies, has opened new avenues for simultaneous data transmission and energy harvesting. In this context, optimizing energy efficiency (EE) is crucial for ensuring sustainable and efficient network operation. This paper proposes a novel approach to EE optimization in multi-UAV-aided wireless-powered IoT networks, focusing on balancing the uplink data transmission rates and total system energy consumption within an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) framework. This involves formulating the EE optimization problem as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP), consisting of the maximization of the uplink total rate and the minimization of the total system energy consumption, which is then transformed into a Single-Objective Optimization Problem (SOOP) using the Tchebycheff method. To address the non-convex nature of the resulting SOOP, characterized by combinatorial variables and coupled constraints, we developed an iterative algorithm that combines Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) with Successive Convex Approximation (SCA). This algorithm decouples the subcarrier assignment and power control subproblems, incorporates a penalty term to relax integer constraints, and alternates between solving each subproblem until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in key performance metrics, highlighting the practical applicability and robustness of our framework for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of real-world UAV-assisted wireless networks. Our findings provide insights for future research on extending the proposed framework to scenarios involving dynamic UAV mobility, multi-hop communication, and enhanced energy management, thereby supporting the development of next-generation sustainable communication systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) threat surface refers to the overall susceptibility of smart devices to potential security risks. This vulnerability includes the combined impact of security weaknesses, gaps in protective measures, and potential vulnerabilities within the device OS, installed libraries, and applications, as well as the infrastructure involved. This comprises both identified and unforeseen risks that could potentially compromise the deviceâs integrity, data, logs, and hosted applications. By minimizing the extent to which the deviceâs components are exposed, it becomes possible to reduce the vulnerabilities inherent in the device, thereby decreasing its overall threat surface area. This research introduces an innovative framework for assessing Smart IoT cameras within the ecosystem. This framework involves the identification and categorization of webcam devices, followed by an analysis of potential threats based on various exposure indicators present within each layer. Subsequently, this information is used to determine the possible paths through which a device might be compromised, allowing for the evaluation of severity and both maturity levels. The authors present metrics that aid in reevaluating and recalibrating the security levels, considering the discovered threat surface elements. These refined metrics offer a fresh perspective on security, offering valuable insights for stakeholders who are engaged in the development, deployment, and evaluation of the security aspects of such devices.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nNew integrated IoT cloud-AWS enhances wind measurement systems.\nâ¢\nUltrasonic wind sensor improvements to ensures efficiency under rain conditions.\nâ¢\nEngineering solution employs complete framework for seamless data flow.\nâ¢\nIntegrated system ready for ML-driven wind data analysis.\nAbstract\nAccurate and efficient wind measurement and monitoring are crucial for various applications, including renewable energy, meteorology, public safety, and environmental research. This paper presents an integrated approach for a cloud-computing Internet of Things-based Automated Weather Station, with edge devices, designed to provide real-time wind measurements in diverse environments. The presented system comprises a dedicated station frame, a self-sufficient solar power setup, an ultrasonic wind sensor, a data transmission node, cloud computing capabilities, and an end-user visualization application. Calibration procedures reduced the maximum mean error of the ultrasonic wind sensors from 0.7 m/s to 0.2 m/s, achieving a 71% improvement in measurement accuracy. Using this method, all station data are processed every 3 seconds and stored ready for Artificial Intelligence usage with an approximate latency of 150â300 milliseconds, representing up to an 85% reduction in processing delay compared to similar solutions with over 1-second latencies. The lightweight and resistant frame design facilitates easy deployment, while the power setup with sub-watt efficiency ensures a reliable energy source. The ultrasonic wind sensor was subjected to calibration procedures and design improvements to increase its performance under specific rain conditions. Internet of Things communication via Hypertext Transfer Protocol enables efficient data transmission between the Automated Weather Station and the cloud server, which processes and stores the data for future analysis. The responsive and auto-adaptive web application allows user-friendly data visualization, making the wind data easily accessible and interpretable. The proposed cloud-computing Internet of Things-based Automated Weather Station framework demonstrates significant potential for accurate and efficient wind measurement and monitoring, paving the way for future advancements in high temporal resolution wind monitoring systems capable of producing big data prepared for subsequent machine learning model approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a cross-perception and cognitive research field in video understanding, motion training feature recognition is a very challenging task to establish a good spatio-temporal modeling of human motion due to the uncertainty of human motion speed, start and end time, appearance and posture, as well as the interference of physical factors such as lighting, perspective and occlusion. The purpose of this study is to use artificial intelligence data mining technology to study the feature recognition application of iot voice devices in sports training. Install the sensor in the appropriate position according to the position and posture to be measured. Ensure that the sensor can accurately measure the relevant features and maintain a stable connection. Using iot voice devices for data acquisition, sensors collect data on relevant features in real time to transmit the data to a cloud platform or local processing device via a wireless connection. By analyzing and mining the data collected by iot voice devices, we hope to effectively identify the characteristics of sports training and provide accurate feedback and guidance for athletes and coaches. The experimental results show that the iot voice device based on artificial intelligence data mining has achieved good results in the feature recognition application of sports training. Through the analysis of sports training data, we can successfully identify the characteristic patterns of different movements, and accurately predict the athletic state and posture of athletes.",

IoT devices, however, are susceptible to various security risks. Cyber-attacks on IoT systems can halt the entire system, resulting in data loss. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can quickly identify malicious activity that could have compromised the network's performance. Effective IDS and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) are necessary to protect IoT systems. Blockchain technology presents another innovative method to strengthen security systems against the latest attacks. This paper focuses on conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Blockchain-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems in IoT Networks. We reviewed several relevant blockchain-based IDS and IPS proposed for IoT networks and their mechanisms. The most recent research articles, published between 2017 and 2022, were selected from several databases. Consequently, a comprehensive review of these selected papers sheds light on their techniques, advantages, and drawbacks.",

They can provide powerful predictions but anticipating issues is not enough. Manufacturing companies must prioritize avoiding inefficiencies, thereby developing improvement strategies from an Operational Excellence perspective. Here, the interpretability dimension of AI-based models could support a complete understanding of the reasons behind the outcomes, making ML and DL models transparent, and allowing the identification of the causal linkages between the inputs and outputs of the system. Within this context, this study aims first to deliver a comprehensive overview of the existing applications of Advanced Analytics techniques leveraging IoT data in manufacturing environments to then analyze their interpretability implications, referring to the interpretability as the description of the link between the independent and dependent variables in a way that is understandable to humans. Different gaps in terms of lack of full data enhancement are highlighted, providing directions for future research.",

Currently, the mobile satellite systems are envisioned as a significant solution for providing mobile services in different settings and for various vital objectives. These satellite systems have special qualities in each of these situations, including extensive coverage area, robustness, and ability to broadcast/multicast. The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) systems are the best promising technology that will offer internet services among the different types of satellite systems. However, the LEO systems are still experiencing certain restrictions with respect to connectivity, stability, and mobility support; because of which communication becomes unreliable. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to broadly explain the LEO systems and services in a comprehensive manner using a variety of perspectives. The paper focus is on key aspects of mobile internet based on satellite systems. This paper illustrates the integration of LEO systems with fifth and sixth generations of mobile cellular networks as well as with the IoT networks. It discusses the problems being faced as a result of the integration between cellular with IoT and satellite systems by comprehending which future research plans are outlined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction The widespread uptake of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought forth numerous security concerns as IoT environments become more heterogeneous, larger, and complex.Because of the evolving threats and large-scale management needed for IoT, traditional security models are often ill-equipped to keep up. In this context, researchers have started exploring the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software-Defined Networking as an alternative solution for adapting and scaling IoT security management. In this article, we take a look at how both technologies are used together and contribute to increasing security for IoT. It starts by describing the major challenges and issues that are seen in securing IoT systems, like device heterogeneity, mass scale updating software security patches etc., visibility and control. It next explores the benefits of AI and SDN separately, describing how security rule settings can be automated using an AI-based method to enhance threat detection (through better performance prediction) and provide intelligent resource orchestration with respect to IoT networks as well as centralized programming by employing a single control plane that seamlessly scales for data processing. The article also went on to explain the promise of AI-SDN hybrid solutions in which data from both technologies is correlated creating a comprehensive IoT security environment that can power automated decision making and quick application of security policies. Apart from that, it documents some relevant case studies and also provides several practical insights into enforcing AI/SDN-driven IoT security solutions with the help of existing infrastructure in tandem with discussing future trends hitting cybersecurity perimeter. The presented work reveals that integration of AI and SDN has the vast capability to combat security issues in IoT environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of devices are connected using a variety of communication technologies to ensure that they can communicate both physically and over the network. However, devices face the challenge of a single point of failure, a malicious user may forge device identity to gain access and jeopardize system security. In addition, devices collect and transmit sensitive data, and the data can be accessed or stolen by unauthorized user, leading to privacy breaches, which posed a significant risk to both the confidentiality of user information and the protection of device integrity. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems and realize the secure transmission of data, this paper proposed EBIAS, a secure and efficient blockchain-based identity authentication scheme designed for IoT devices. First, EBIAS combined the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm and the SHA-256 algorithm to achieve encrypted communication of the sensitive data. Second, EBIAS integrated blockchain to tackle the single point of failure and ensure the integrity of the sensitive data. Finally, we performed security analysis and conducted sufficient experiment. The analysis and experimental results demonstrate that EBIAS has certain improvements on security and performance compared with the previous schemes, which further proves the feasibility and effectiveness of EBIAS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) sensor networks are connected systems of physical devices set with actuators, sensors, and communication abilities, allowing them to gather, spread, and exchange information with centralized methods. These networks are essential in numerous businesses, such as healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and smart cities, as they deliver real-time observation, data-driven insights, and automation. Threat recognition in IoT sensor networks is a vital feature of safeguarding the protection and consistency of interconnected systems in the IoT. As IoT sensor networks endure to increase across various industries, the vulnerability to malicious actions and cyber-attacks increases. Threat recognition utilizing deep learning (DL) leverages neural networks to examine complex patterns and anomalies in data, permitting the identification of potential safety threats. DL techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel at learning complex representations of data and feature extraction, making them suitable for identifying sophisticated attacks in different fields, including cybersecurity. This research develops a Hybrid Sine-Cosine Chimp Optimization Feature Selection with a Deep Learning (HSCCOFS-DL) approach for Threat Recognition in IoT Sensor Networks. The foremost aim of the HSCCOFS-DL system lies in the automated detection of threats using DL models. To accomplish this, the HSCCOFS-DL approach undergoes a data normalization process. Besides, the selection of features can be performed using the HSCCO algorithm. Meanwhile, the symmetrical autoencoder (SAE) technique effectively classifies threats. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) can be applied to the selection of the hyperparameter of the SAE system. The experimental assessment of the HSCCOFS-DL technique takes place on a benchmark dataset. The simulation results indicated that the HSCCOFS-DL approach attains enhanced performance over other methods.",

This research presents a comprehensive study on DDoS attack detection using the NSL-KDD dataset. The dataset contains a diverse set of network traffic data. This paper proposes two approaches, one utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and another without PCA, to compare their performance. Robust scaling and encoding techniques are applied as preprocessing steps. The experiment outcomes demonstrate a noteworthy improvement in the accuracy of DDoS attack detection in IoT devices by integrating PCA and Robust Scaler. Notably, the Random Forest and KNN classifiers demonstrate exceptional performance with an accuracy of 99.87 % and 99.14 %, respectively, while NaÃ¯ve Bayes shows a lower accuracy of 87.14 %. The findings from this experiment contribute valuable insights into enhancing the security of IoT devices against DDoS attacks. The proposed approach showcases the importance of appropriate preprocessing techniques in achieving robust intrusion detection systems for IoT environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe construction of IoT cloud platform brings great convenience to the storage of massive IoT node data. To ensure security of data collected by the IoT nodes, the data must be encrypted when the nodes upload it. However, it arises some challenge problems, such as efficient retrieval on encrypted data, secure de-duplication and massive data recovery. Proxy Re-Encryption with Equality Test (PREET) can be used to solve these problems. But, existing PREET schemes are based on bilinear pairings, which have low operational efficiency. In order to improve the overall operational efficiency, this paper constructs a Pairing-Free PREET scheme (PF-PREET). Security of this scheme is guaranteed by the Gap Computational DiffieâHellman assumption in random oracle model. It is demonstrated that the PF-PREET scheme can achieve ciphertext indistinguishability for malicious users and one-wayness for malicious servers. It still has the same security level compared to existing PREET schemes by expanding the scope of the equality test. We discussed the efficiency of the proposed PF-PREET scheme in terms of overall running time, average running time of each phase and time overhead of tag test. The simulated experiment shows a certain improvement compared to PREET schemes using bilinear pairing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSmart home technologies (the Internet of Things [IoT]) are increasingly being implemented in human life, and a growing body of evidence demonstrates their usefulness for people with disabilities and elderly people. To fully benefit from their use, these individuals must know the different existing tools and their potential and be trained and motivated to use them. The current study aims to evaluate the factors that promote the use of smart home technologies (IoT) in people's lives. Data were gathered from 130 Saudi individuals via a survey questionnaire. Mean, standard deviation, and MANOVA were calculated. According to the results, the participants showed a moderate perception toward IoT technologies, with a mean score of (M = 2.06 and SD = 0.328). Moreover, no statistically significant differences were found in the perceived usefulness of the IoT and its dimensions (usage, skills, obstacles, and inclusion) among participants, based on gender, education level, category, experience, and devices used. While elder participants demonstrated higher perceived usefulness and perceived obstacles than the younger participants, as evidenced by the statistically significant differences in the results (MS = 0.432, F = 4.197, Sig0.017 < 0.05; MS = 0.545, F = 4.615, Sig0.012 < 0.05), the usage, skills, and inclusion dimensions showed no significant differences by participants' ages (MS = 1.080, F = 3.035, Sig0.052 > 0.05; MS = 0.584, F = 2.882, Sig0.060 > 0.05; MS = 0.255, F = 1.939, Sig0.148 > 0.05, respectively). The results support the relevance of providing knowledge and enhancing skills, thereby fostering a positive perception of IoT technologies. This study is one of the few addressing IoT technologies in special needs settings in the Middle East region. It has the potential to support evidence that IoT technologies are especially significant for people with special needs and elderly individuals.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) is set to revolutionize the pace of interaction among entities, ushering in a proliferation of applications characterized by heightened quality and diversity. Among the pivotal applications within the realm of IoT, as a significant example, the Smart Grid (SG) evolves into intricate networks of energy deployment marked by data integration. This evolution concurrently entails data interchange with other IoT entities. However, there are also several challenges including data-sharing overheads and the intricate establishment of trusted centers in the IoT ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical secure data-sharing platform empowered by cloud-fog integration. Furthermore, we propose a novel non-interactive zero-knowledge proof-based group authentication and key agreement protocol that supports one-to-many sharing sets of IoT data, especially SG data. The security formal verification tool shows that the proposed scheme can achieve mutual authentication and secure data sharing while protecting the privacy of data providers. Compared with previous IoT data sharing schemes, the proposed scheme has advantages in both computational and transmission efficiency, and has more superiority with the increasing volume of shared data or increasing number of participants.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nEmerging as a paradigmatic shift in urban development, smart cities harness the potential of advanced information and communication technologies to seamlessly integrate urban functions, optimize resource allocation, and improve the effectiveness of city management. Within the domain of smart education, the imperative application of Visual Question Answering (VQA) technology encounters significant limitations at the prevailing stage, particularly the absence of a robust Internet of Things (IoT) framework and the inadequate incorporation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) within contemporary smart education paradigms, especially in addressing zero-shot VQA scenarios, which pose considerable challenges. In response to these constraints, this paper introduces an IoT-based smart city framework that is designed to refine the functionality and efficacy of educational systems. This framework is delineated into four cardinal layers: the data collection layer, data transmission layer, data management layer, and application layer. Furthermore, we introduce the innovative TeachVQA methodology at the application layer, synergizing VQA technology with extensive pre-trained language models, thereby considerably enhancing the dissemination and assimilation of educational content. Evaluative metrics in the VQAv2 and OKVQA datasets substantiate that the TeachVQA methodology not only outperforms existing VQA approaches, but also underscores its profound potential and practical relevance in the educational sector.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nHigh investment cost for IoT animal sensors is a major barrier to adoption.\nâ¢\nNon-users evaluate the acceptance barriers more critically than IoT sensor users.\nâ¢\nDairy farmers' acceptance is influenced by desire and cognitive behavioral factors.\nâ¢\nPositive emotions are a key determinant of dairy farmers' desire to adopt IoT-based animal sensors.\nAbstract\nThe digitalization of agriculture is on the rise, and while the dairy industry is not considered a leader in digitalization, more and more technologies have been developed in recent years. In particular, monitoring the health of dairy cows is becoming increasingly digital with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. IoT-based sensors can potentially support efficient dairy production while enabling better animal welfare. Against this background, the question of technology acceptance among dairy farmers is becoming increasingly important. It is evident that acceptance, especially in the area of IoT-based dairy sensors, has only been sporadically researched, with behavioral factors rarely considered. Acceptance research has predominantly focused on a technological perspective or has been limited to operational and socio-demographic factors, thus failing to capture the entire acceptance process. Based on this, the aim of the paper is to identify prevailing acceptance barriers and examine whether cognitive and affective influencing factors, combined into a single behavioral model, can explain the acceptance, and therewith precondition for adoption, of IoT-based animal sensors. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted among 212 German dairy farmers. The analysis included a partial least squares estimation of the behavioral model. The results show that acceptance barriers differ between users and non-users of IoT-based sensors. However, both groups consider high investment costs as the most important barrier. Furthermore, the results indicate that both cognitive factors and positive anticipated emotions influence acceptance decisions. Additionally, the main determinants of the theory of planned behavior, namely attitude and behavioral control, have a positive influence on the desire to use IoT-based animal sensors. Ultimately, this has a positive impact on the acceptance. The results emphasise that, in addition to the technical requirements and cognitive attitudes, emotional factors are relevant for the acceptance of IoT-based animal sensors among dairy farmers. These findings are important for manufacturers, policy and agricultural and digital associations.",

By leveraging the power of IoT and blockchain, we can create a highly secure, transparent, and efficient system that can transform the way we move people and goods. India, one of the worldâs most populous countries, has a highly congested and inefficient transportation system that often leads to delays, accidents, and waste of time and resources. The integration of IoT and blockchain can help address these issues by enabling real-time monitoring, tracking, and optimization of traffic flows, thereby reducing congestion, improving safety, and increasing the overall efficiency of the transportation system. This paper explores the potential of blockchain technology in the context of integrated IoT networks for constructing scalable ITS systems in India. The methodology followed is to develop a proof-of-concept blockchain-based application for ITS, implement the blockchain solution into the existing ITS infrastructure, and ensure proper integration and compatibility with other systems. Conduct thorough research and maintenance to ensure the reliability and sustainability of such blockchain-based systems. This research discusses the various benefits and challenges of this approach and the various applications of this technology in the transportation sector, including the green sustainability concept. The results find various ways in which such implementations of blockchain and IoT-Machine Learning (IoT-ML) can revolutionize transportation systems.",

It represents the interconnection of everyday objects, devices and machines to the internet, allowing them to collect, exchange and analyze data. As the number of connected objects grows exponentially, energy consumption and data security become essential challenges to ensure a sustainable development of green IoT. Data compression theory can be used as an enticing key to downsize the large amount of circulated information, since wireless communication is the prime energy consuming component in IoT devices. In addition, data encryption algorithms are crucial to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of IoT systems. Therefore, combining compression and encryption can lead to improved overall IoT system performance in terms of both power cost and data privacy. In this paper, a lightweight and secure compression approach is introduced to efficiently manage the energy expenditure and provide end-to-end security for energy constrained devices. This proposed algorithm combines the performance of LTC compression and AES encryption to securely encode collected data in IoT devices. The energy model analysis has shown that the suggested method is effective in terms of processing energy, reduces the volume of transmitted data and guarantees end-to-end information privacy.",

Threats and attacks mounted against IoT deployments have only increased in recent times. There have been several proposals to secure home automation environments, but there is no full protection against Cybersecurity threats for our home IoT platforms. This research investigates attack attempts on smart home environments, focusing on firmware, brute force, and DoS attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) network which were successful in bringing down the device in less than a minute. Weak passwords were cracked using Brute Force techniques related to HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and FTP protocols, and an unknown service port to reveal backdoor access. Cross-site scripting vulnerability was detected on IoT devices that could allow running malicious scripts on the devices. The authors also exploited the unknown services to reveal backdoors and access sensitive device details and potentially exploited them to add new ports or rules to turn the IoT devices into a router to attack other devices. To detect and mitigate such attacks, the authors present an IoT-based intrusion detection and prevention system to secure smart home network devices. The authors compared the proposed framework with other similar research based on Precision, Accuracy, F-measure, and Recall. The proposed model outperforms all the other known models reporting a high of 95% for identifying malicious attack packets, while others reported 58% and 71% detection percentage.",

        "abstract": "In many commercial and public sectors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is deeply embedded. Cyber security threats aimed at compromising the security, reliability, or accessibility of data are a serious concern for the IoT. Due to the collection of data from several IoT devices, the IoT presents unique challenges for detecting anomalous behavior. It is the responsibility of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to ensure the security of a network by reporting any suspicious activity. By identifying failed and successful attacks, IDS provides a more comprehensive security capability. A reliable and efficient anomaly detection system is essential for IoT-driven decision-making. Using deep learning-based anomaly detection, this study proposes an IoT anomaly detection system capable of identifying relevant characteristics in a controlled environment. These factors are used by the classifier to improve its ability to identify fraudulent IoT data. For efficient outlier detection, the author proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Attention Mechanism (ACNN-LSTM). As part of the ACNN-LSTM model, CNN units are deployed with an attention mechanism to avoid memory loss and gradient dispersion. Using the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the model is verified. According to the N-BaIoT dataset, the overall accuracy is 99%, and precision, recall, and F1-score are also 0.99. In addition, the IoT-23 dataset shows a commendable accuracy of 99%. In terms of accuracy and recall, it scored 0.99, while the F1-score was 0.98. The LSTM model with attention achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88%. According to the loss graph, attention-based models had lower loss values, indicating that they were more effective at detecting anomalies. In both the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (ROC-AUC) graphs demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 99% to 100% for the Attention-based CNN and LSTM models. This indicates that these models are capable of making precise predictions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditionally concrete strength determination has been a costly and time-consuming process, relying on periodic laboratory testing using compression tests on concrete-filled cylinders. To address these challenges, an innovative framework has been developed using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology-based low-cost wireless sensors. These sensors have been programmed to integrate with a real-time data monitoring platform using the Firebase cloud computing application. This framework allows remote real-time concrete compressive strength monitoring while reducing the need for on-site laboratory testing. This aspect can ultimately add digital competencies to the construction industry. The IoT-based data is further integrated with the Building Information Modeling (BIM) model of the structure, developing its Digital Twin (DT), which enables the concerned authorities to remotely access the concrete compressive strength parameters, particularly in the early stages. The proposed system presents notable advantages compared to traditional methods by enabling remote real-time monitoring of concrete strength parameters in the BIM environment and facilitating informed decision-making to optimize the construction schedule utilizing the Active BIM system. It serves as a pioneering advancement in internet/remote applications designed to monitor early-age compressive strength. By assisting project managers in timely actions such as formwork removal, post-tensioning, curing termination, and reshores removal, it generates significant cost savings in terms of labor and expedites the completion of construction activities.",

Though accurate devices for measuring hydrological processes are available, the on-site deployment and operation of effective monitoring networks face many relevant issues caused by the peculiar characteristics of hydrological systems. In this manuscript, we present a self-developed system for monitoring events-based hydrological processes comprising a dense network with both soil moisture and water level gauges connected by NB-IoT technology integrated into a cloud system for near real-time gathering of information. We designed, built and calibrated the sensors and integrated them into a cloud system. We deployed them in two monitoring networks and gathered the data from several experimental runs (battery lifecycles). Results showed the suitability of the sensors and the network to properly monitor the processes solving the initial relevant issues mainly derived from connectivity issues and battery duration.",

However, grid-connected DFIGs are vulnerable to voltage dips, which can cause power quality concerns and possible turbine damage. An Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring technique for field-oriented control (FOC)-based DFIG with grid-side converter (GSC) control is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach uses real-time WT voltage and current data to dynamically alter the GSC control settings, allowing for steady operation and minimizing power quality problems during voltage dips. A 2 MW variable-speed pitch-controlled DFIG with a speed limit of 900â2000 rpm is used for performance investigation under voltage dips with crowbar protection. An IoT based monitoring system sends real-time information to a cloud server for additional analysis after detecting anomalies. The ThingSpeak cloud platform sends email notifications of defects, and an MIT App Inventor application is constructed for data visualization. The proposed strategy's effectiveness is confirmed through the simulation results.",

Yet, they affect user privacy and render personal data more vulnerable. To foster a digital future fully aware of user privacy requirements, a line of design research emerges that focuses on balancing product innovation with user data protection. This matter relates to sociocultural, economic, and technological aspects, and its core is a human-centered design strategy. Still, there is a gap in academic research oriented towards guiding product developers on how to consider personal data privacy concerns when designing honest IoT devices. To define this gap and delve deeper into this relevant topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review of recent academic research using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. This review focuses on prevalent research topics such as data privacy, personal data, data surveillance, and user behaviour in IoT. The result is a state-of-the-art compilation of 45 scientific studies mapping the most relevant concepts and approaches for product development in the last ten years of research, aligned with some central research questions. The Discussion and Conclusion sections provide a deep understanding of the complexity of the fast-changing landscape of privacy and personal data management using IoT products. Finally, this study proposes future academic research directions devoted to providing product designer specific, specialised help from different (yet interconnected) scientific approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have rapidly spread in recent decades, leading to remarkable innovation and integrated possibilities. The switch from IPv4 to IPv6, made possible by advancements in networking technology and the use of nanodevices, has further improved connectivity. This move allows for connecting a wider range of devices to servers. Nevertheless, the increasing interconnectivity has brought about difficulties in efficiently overseeing and analysing the enormous amount of data produced throughout all levels of the IoT. The requirement of comprehensive security management is particularly concerning for IoT devices due to their large quantity and small size. Within the layered architecture of IoT, the network layer assumes pivotal importance in ensuring security, bearing responsibility for storing routing information and executing corresponding decisions. The Black Hole attack is a frequently encountered and significant concern among the security attacks addressed. This paper thoroughly examines the consequences of the Black Hole attack on IoT networks, carefully analyzing its impact. Furthermore, it presents a novel mitigation algorithm designed to counter such threats efficiently. The research employs NS2 and Simulink to run extensive simulations, enabling the evaluation of network throughput and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Applying the proposed mitigation strategy to a network affected by the Black Hole attack results in a significant improvement in throughput, which closely resembles that of an unaffected network. The observed Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) is measured at 98.21%. This highlights the algorithmâs effectiveness in mitigating the detrimental effects of the Black Hole attack on IoT networks.",

        "abstract": "While emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) have many benefits, they also pose considerable security challenges that require innovative solutions, including those based on artificial intelligence (AI), given that these techniques are increasingly being used by malicious actors to compromise IoT systems. Although an ample body of research focusing on conventional AI methods exists, there is a paucity of studies related to advanced statistical and optimization approaches aimed at enhancing security measures. To contribute to this nascent research stream, a novel AI-driven security system denoted as âAI2AIâ is presented in this work. AI2AI employs AI techniques to enhance the performance and optimize security mechanisms within the IoT framework. We also introduce the Genetic Algorithm Anomaly Detection and Prevention Deep Neural Networks (GAADPSDNN) system that can be implemented to effectively identify, detect, and prevent cyberattacks targeting IoT devices. Notably, this system demonstrates adaptability to both federated and centralized learning environments, accommodating a wide array of IoT devices. Our evaluation of the GAADPSDNN system using the recently complied WUSTL-IIoT and Edge-IIoT datasets underscores its efficacy. Achieving an impressive overall accuracy of 98.18% on the Edge-IIoT dataset, the GAADPSDNN outperforms the standard deep neural network (DNN) classifier with 94.11% accuracy. Furthermore, with the proposed enhancements, the accuracy of the unoptimized random forest classifier (80.89%) is improved to 93.51%, while the overall accuracy (98.18%) surpasses the results (93.91%, 94.67%, 94.94%, and 94.96%) achieved when alternative systems based on diverse optimization techniques and the same dataset are employed. The proposed optimization techniques increase the effectiveness of the anomaly detection system by efficiently achieving high accuracy and reducing the computational load on IoT devices through the adaptive selection of active features.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs wireless communication grows, so does the need for smart, simple, affordable solutions. The need prompted academics to develop appropriate network solutions ranging from wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to the Internet of Things (IoT). With the innovations of researchers, the necessity for enhancements in existing researchers has increased. Initially, network protocols were the focus of study and development. Regardless, IoT devices are already being employed in different industries and collecting massive amounts of data through complicated applications. This necessitates IoT load-balancing research. Several studies tried to address the communication overheads produced by significant IoT network traffic. These studies intended to control network loads by evenly spreading them across IoT nodes. Eventually, the practitioners decided to migrate the IoT node data and the apps processing it to the cloud. So, the difficulty is to design a cloud-based load balancer algorithm that meets the criteria of IoT network protocols. Defined as a unique method for controlling loads on cloud-integrated IoT networks. The suggested method analyses actual and virtual host machine needs in cloud computing environments. The purpose of the proposed model is to design a load balancer that improves network response time while reducing energy consumption. The proposed load balancer algorithm may be easily integrated with peer-existing IoT frameworks. Handling the load for cloud-based IoT architectures with the above-described methods. Significantly boosts response time for the IoT network by 60 %. The proposed scheme has less energy consumption (31 %), less execution time (24\\%), decreased node shutdown time (45 %), and less infrastructure cost (48\\%) in comparison to existing frameworks. Based on the simulation results, it is concluded that the proposed framework offers an improved solution for IoT-based cloud load-balancing issues.",

To tackle these challenges, recent decentralized algorithms in Fog-IoT use Distributed Ledger Technologies to orchestrate resources and payments between peers. However, while distributed ledgers provide many desirable properties, their consensus mechanism introduces a performance bottleneck. This paper introduces Light-HIDRA, a consensus-less and decentralized resource orchestration system for Fog-IoT environments. At its core, Light-HIDRA uses Byzantine Reliable Broadcast (BRB) to coordinate actions without centralized control, therefore drastically reducing communication overhead and latency compared to consensus-based solutions. Light-HIDRA coordinates the scheduling and execution of workloads, and securely manages the payments that peers receive for dedicating resources to workloads. Light-HIDRA further increases performance and reduces overhead by grouping peers into distinct domains. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the protocolâs security properties, investigating its efficiency and robustness in diverse situations. We evaluate the performance of Light-HIDRA, highlighting its performance over HIDRA, a state-of-the-art baseline that uses smart contracts. Our experiments demonstrate that Light-HIDRA reduces the bandwidth usage by up to 57x, the latency of workload offloading by up to 142x, and shows superior throughput compared to HIDRA.",

Despite their ubiquity, these devices are notably resource-constrained and frequently lack robust security defenses, presenting a substantial risk of intrusion and cyber threats. To address these concerns, we propose a novel anomaly-based host intrusion detection system specifically designed for IoT devices, titled MARS (Memory Anomaly Recognition System). MARS is designed to function as a crucial component in the incident response framework, acting as an early detection system for potential security breaches within an organizationâs network or systems. The fundamental architecture of MARS leverages the deviceâs memory as a key indicator for monitoring system-level events. To enhance its security and integrity, MARS is embedded within a Trusted Execution Environmentâa secure, hardware-isolated region of a microcontroller protected from untrusted software. This design choice not only makes MARS tamper-proof but also ensures reliable monitoring of the deviceâs memory. Deviations from established memory baselines, indicative of a security compromise, are detected through an anomaly detection algorithm hosted on a remote server. Our evaluation of the MARS prototype on STM32L562QEI6QU showed our proposed architecture can achieve decent scalability while maintaining trust, accuracy, and robustness of memory changes.",

This optimization is exclusively achieved through DT approach. NB-IoT is a Low-Powered Wide Area Network (LPWAN) standardized by 3GPP and leverages Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology. The Amplify-and-Forward (AF) optimization technique is used to improve the performance of some notably poor-performing terminals in the scenario. Bit-Error-Rate (BER) tests show the terminalsâ overall performance before and after optimization. An improvement of 17% is achieved in BER. The signal quality of the channels is analyzed as well as the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is used to showcase the effective throughput performance of the NB-IoT terminals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLegacy routing with conventional distributed networking in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks needs to work on efficiently handling service requests, leading to compromised Quality of Service (QoS) for user demands. In this research, we introduce Reliable routing based on Reinforcement learning in SD-IoT Networks (RRSN), an intelligent routing technique leveraging Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in IoT networks. RRSN utilizes a hybrid mechanism that combines Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) within SDNâs centralized control to optimize QoS-aware reliable routing. In addition, network telemetry is utilized for intelligent network monitoring in the data plane to get the underlying networkâs status efficiently. The proposed approach consists of three main modules: a Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning algorithm to predict link reliability, a traffic classifier for QoS-based traffic classification, and a reliability-aware reinforcement learning algorithm to compute optimal routing paths for IoT sensors. SVR algorithm has a high prediction accuracy, is lightweight, less susceptible to noisy data, and its computational complexity is independent of the dimensions of the input space. RRSN leverages intelligent network monitoring with RL, global view, and centralized SDN control to compute and implement optimal routes in data plane switches efficiently. We conduct extensive Proof-Of-Concept (POC) experimental evaluations, comparing RRSN with state-of-the-art models, including POC experiments in real Internet topologies. The results demonstrate that RRSN outperforms existing schemes in network performance metrics such as throughput, jitter, packet loss ratio, and delay, showcasing its effectiveness in improved QoS for IoT networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAlthough Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become the backbone technology of several Internet of Things (IoT) applications, their execution in resource-constrained devices remains challenging. To cater for these challenges, collaborative deep inference conducted by IoT devices was introduced. However, the prevalence of DNN computation suffers from severe privacy problems, e.g. data-reverse and model leakage. Particularly, malicious participants can accurately recover the received data to access sensitive information. Furthermore, the system is composed of heterogeneous data-sources represented by different DNN models that wish to execute classifications without exposing their data and models. Though, relaying the trained models to a centralized unit managing the collaboration leads to major risks because some features can be revealed through these models, in addition to dependency and scalability problems. In this paper, we present an approach that targets the privacy of collaborative inference via controlling the amount of data assigned to different participants, to prevent them from reversing attempts. Moreover, each independent data-source requesting inference will be responsible to manage the distribution of its DNN locally. In this context, different sources are required to compete over the pervasive resources while cooperating to maintain privacy welfare. We formulate this methodology, as an integer programming problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference and the privacy required by heterogeneous entities. A distributed solution scheme is also developed based on the Lagrangian dual problem. Next, to relax the optimization, we shape our approach as a cooperative and competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that supports heterogeneous/independent agents. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrated that our method yields results on par with those of a single RL agent in terms of action performance, while maintaining the privacy of individual agentsâ information. Additionally, it surpasses the Independent Q-Learning (IQL) approach, where agents operate autonomously, in safeguarding inference privacy.",

The resource-constrained fog devices restrict the number of application deployments due to a lack of efficient resource estimation and discovery mechanisms for various emergent heterogeneous IoT applications. An efficient resource allocation strategy is one of the best choices to meet these applicationâs Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and improve system performance. However, finding the best allocation strategy for IoT applications with more than one QoS parameter is a challenge, and it has been proved as a non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem. This article formulates a classical weighted multi-objective IoT service placement to optimize three parameters, i.e., makespan, cost, and energy. The non-convexity nature of the solution space motivates us to focus on the population-based meta-heuristic algorithm, i.e. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), along with their combination GA-SA, and GA-PSO. It implements the algorithm and compares it with the greedy-based random placement approach, varying the number of IoT applications with different parameters. The final results reveal that the hybrid method GA-SA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) gives the ability to people and machines to interact and learn from billions of items, including sensors, actuators, services, and other things that are connected to the Internet. The services provided by IoT are becoming an indispensable part of human life, further, the growth in the number of IoT devices is predicted to increase exponentially in the next few years. However, the IoT network consists of a variety of different types of devices being placed in heterogeneous environments. The data these devices generate contains noise in significant proportion. Also, these devices are vulnerable to various different kinds of attacks, identification of which is a challenging task in itself as they are in large numbers. The detection of faults is necessary for the early stages. Generic methods of authentication and authorization are not sufficient for these devices. Further, we need methods that can detect the attack at an early stage based on previous patterns and alert the system at the right time. In recent years machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms have advanced considerably from being an experimental project in the research community to being applied in industry-standard applications. These algorithms have the potential to be better than simple security methods in providing intelligence to the system. In this article, we have reviewed various ML/DL algorithms with their advantages, and disadvantages, and how they can be applied in securing IoTs. Initially, a detailed overview of IoT, components, and applications are presented. After that, we present an overview of various threats, and attack methods are discussed with the probable ML/DL solutions.",

The wireless network, B bluetooth network, infrared network, and other networks are the key components of the Internet of Things (IoT). The major emphasis of this work was on the impact of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative on worm propagation in heterogeneous susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered wireless IoT devices. We first determined the equilibrium points and fundamental reproduction number for the Caputo-Fabrizio HSEIR system, and then we discussed the stability of the system at the worm propagation equilibrium point. Using the Picard-Lindeof method, we determine the existence and unique solution for the fractional CF system of the heterogeneous SEIR model. Next, we use fixed point theory to judge the stability of the iterative method. We investigate the impact of the derivative order on the behaviour of the resultant functions and acquired numerical values by computing the model's findings for various fractional orders. In addition, we compute the integer-order model's results and contrast them with the results of the fractional-order model. We develop a periodically intermittent controller driven by white noise with the amazing benefits of reduced cost and more adaptable control technique to restrict the spread of worms in wireless IoT networks. To clearly define the conditions for stability in probability one, we employ the stochastic analysis technique. Our results show that the nonlinear worm propagation system may be stabilised by intermittent stochastic perturbation under the parameters of intermittent time linked to stochastic perturbation strength. Our theoretical conclusions may be used to analyse the observable processes of the worm, design countermeasures to prevent its spread, and evaluate the consequences of various system parameters.",

However, developing fabric-based TENGs with outstanding triboelectric performanceâfeaturing high power density, stability, comfort, washability, reliability, and sensing capabilities âis still challenging. The mechanics of fabric, particularly its compressive properties, play a crucial role in influencing the energy output of TENGs. Understanding this relationship is key to enhancing energy generation capabilities. In this study, we explored the impact of fabric compressive mechanics on a novel Core Spun Yarn (CSY) based dual-effect fabric TENGs energy and sensing. We designed five distinct knitted fabric structures; single bed, double bed, half cardigan, full cardigan, and ripple structures, and tried to explain their mechanical behavior in relation to TENG performance, focusing on parameters such as Work Done in Compression (WC), Compressive Resilience (RC), and Compressive Linearity (LC). We observed a strong positive correlation between the compressive energy (0.03 gf. cm/cmÂ²), resilience (40â¯%), linearity (0.5), and density (28â¯cmÂ²) of the full cardigan knitted structure and the electrical output of the TENGs in a contact-separation configuration. These findings reveal the influence of fabric mechanics to TENG output and explain why the full cardigan fabric is the most optimal choice for fabric-based TENGs, achieving a maximum peak power of 120â¯mW and a peak power density of 588â¯mW/mÂ² at an external impedance of 1 GÎ©, a frequency of 8â¯Hz, and a normal pressure of 50â¯N. Based on this fabric, we have developed a complete IoT-enabled intelligent carpet system for the precise detection of movement. This research provides a method for creating dual-effect fabric TENG devices, paving the way for the development of TENG fabrics that can simultaneously perform real-time sensing and energy generation.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (209KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA content delivery network (CDN) aims to reduce the content delivery latency to end-users by using distributed cache servers. Nevertheless, deploying and maintaining cache servers on a large scale is very expensive. To solve this problem, CDN providers have developed a new content delivery strategy: allowing end-usersâs IoT edge devices to share their storage/bandwidth resources. This new edge CDN platform must address two core questions: (1) how can we incentivize end users to share IoT devices? (2) how can we facilitate a safe and transparent content transaction environment for end users? This paper introduces SmartSharing, a new content delivery network solution to address these questions. In smartSharing, the over-the-top (OTT) IoT devices belonging to end-users are used as mini-cache servers. To motivate end users to share the idle devices and storage/bandwidth resources, SmartSharing designs the content delivery schedule and the pricing scheme based on game theory and machine learning algorithms (specifically, a tailored expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm). To facilitate content trading among end users, SmartSharing creates a secure and transparent transaction platform based on smart contracts in Ethereum. In addition, SmartSharingâs performance evaluation is through trace-driven simulations in the real world and a prototype using content metadata and the achieved pricing schemes. The evaluation results show that CDN providers, end users and content providers can all benefit from our SmartSharing framework.",

Most studies use learning models to detect or classify malware. Therefore, ensuring high-quality labels for malware samples is crucial to maintaining research accuracy. Researchers typically submit malware samples to Anti-Virus (AV) engines to obtain labels, but different engines have varying rules for detecting maliciousness and variants. This study aims to improve future IoT malware research accuracy by investigating label quality. We address three label-related issues, including Anti-Virus detection technology, naming rules, and label expiration. Additionally, we examine multiple sources of malware labels, including 63 studies on IoT, Windows, and Android malware, as well as commonly used tools such as AVClass and Anti-Virus engines. To evaluate and recommend label sources, we construct classification models using an IoT malware dataset obtained from VirusShare, which is labeled with common tools and Anti-Virus engines and classified based on ELF features. For family classification, we investigate four methods and tools, and for variant hierarchy classification, we compare label overlaps with sample clustering from 12 Anti-Virus engines. Based on our findings, we recommend AVClass for obtaining labels for IoT family classification. For small-scale malware families at the variant level, we recommend using the labels from Ad-Aware, BitDefender, and Emsisoft engines. For large-scale malware families, we advise employing labels from Jiangmin, NANO-Antivirus, and Avira engines, serving as a valuable guide for future IoT malware research.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (284KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn many real-world contexts, the Internet of Things (IoT) is valued for its capacity to facilitate the smooth operation of interoperable applications and services. It is critical to ensure the accessibility and replication of IoT resources to improve the agility of these applications. As a solution, the Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm is embedded into the IoT design to leverage information from various endpoint applications better and maximize resource utilization. In this study, the Shared Replication Augmenting Method (SRAM) is proposed to increase resource usage in underutilized NFVs and maintain service availability simultaneously. The regressive decision-making learning used by SRAM enables the detection of NFV needs for data and application portability across various real-time use cases. This regression method can uncover data needs and their causes, allowing for prompt answers and more efficient use of available resources. The suggested SRAM technique dynamically modifies the procedure while considering computation-less function allocations, making it suitable for various interoperable applications. It distributes root-to-service virtualization and availability based on historical use and data replication. Therefore, SRAM improves resource usage by 7.09 % with no increase in latency or delays. It also increases service availability by 10.4 %, reduces latency by 11.89 %, eliminates backlogs by 11.1 %, and reduces data repetition by 8.97 %. This study enhances resource consumption and productivity in IoT settings by offering SRAM as a viable solution. The study's results prove its potential to reduce the occurrence of replication, delay, and queues while raising the availability of services.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAncient murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, have profound historical and cultural significance. However, these murals often face degradation phenomena such as peeling, fading, and cracking, which compromises their preservation. Conventional methodologies for protection and restoration exhibit limitations and do not adequately address multifaceted damage conditions, thus necessitating the integration of advanced technological interventions to enhance restoration effectiveness.This paper delineates a framework for the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage buildings that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using real-time environmental and structural health surveillance, in conjunction with security mechanisms, this framework markedly improves precision and efficiency in forecasting and identifying potential risks.Furthermore, in the context of mural restoration, this paper introduces the ArtDiff model. This model amalgamates a modified U-Net for initial crack detection with an edge-guided restoration technique, employing a diffusion model for meticulous restoration. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of the ArtDiff model in crack detection and mural restoration, delivering a greater precision and efficacy relative to existing approaches. Through the implementation of multilevel supervision strategies and an avant-garde model architecture, this study offers a sophisticated mural restoration solution, furnishing novel technological support for the preservation of cultural heritage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHealthcare monitoring frameworks emerged as one of the most essential frameworks and innovations established over the last decade. As a result of failing to provide adequate clinical attention to patients at the appropriate time, many people are facing the possibility of an untimely death. Ultimately, the goal was to develop an IoT-based integrated healthcare monitoring framework that could be relied upon by healthcare professionals to screen their patients, whether they were in the hospital or at home, to ensure that they were being well-cared for. Sensors, an information acquisition unit, a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino), and a product modification were used to construct a mobile phone-based remote healthcare monitoring framework that may provide continuous web-based data about a patient's physiological states (i.e., JAVA). The framework checks, displays, and stores the patient's temperature, heart rate, and EEG data before sending it out on the specialist's portable device with the application. In this way, an IoT-based patient monitoring framework may effectively monitor a patient's health state and save their life on time.",

        "abstract": "The primary concern of modern technology is cyber attacks targeting the Internet of Things. As it is one of the most widely used networks today and vulnerable to attacks. Real-time threats pose with modern cyber attacks that pose a great danger to the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, as devices can be monitored or service isolated from them and affect users in one way or another. Securing Internet of Things networks is an important matter, as it requires the use of modern technologies and methods, and real and up-to-date data to design and train systems to keep pace with the modernity that attackers use to confront these attacks. One of the most common types of attacks against IoT devices is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Our paper makes a unique contribution that differs from existing studies, in that we use recent data that contains real traffic and real attacks on IoT networks. And a hybrid method for selecting relevant features, And also how to choose highly efficient algorithms. What gives the model a high ability to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. the model proposed is based on a two-stage process: selecting essential features and constructing a detection model using the K-neighbors algorithm with two classifier algorithms (logistic regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier (SGD), combining these classifiers through ensemble machine learning (stacking), and optimizing parameters through Grid Search-CV to enhance system accuracy. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model using the CIC-IoT2023 and CIC-DDoS2019 datasets. Performance evaluation demonstrated the potential of our model in robust intrusion detection in IoT networks, achieving an accuracy of 99.965% and a detection time of 0.20 s for the CIC-IoT2023 dataset, and 99.968% accuracy with a detection time of 0.23 s for the CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with recent related works highlighted the superiority of our methodology in intrusion detection, showing improvements in accuracy, recall, and detection time.",

In this system, UAV can work as a carrier emitter and data collector to/from a group of passive sensor nodes, whose operation is based on the principle of backscattering technology. Exact and asymptotic mathematical equations are obtained to describe the system performance, such as outage probability, effective capacity, and average BER over a correlated Nakagami-m fading channel, assuming that forward and backscatter links are correlated. In addition, an optimal data collection location for the UAV is also explored by decreasing the euclidean distance between the UAV and the sensor nodes. The numerically simulated results show that the impact of channel correlation degrades the system performance significantly, which can be improved when the fading parameter m increases. Besides, by carefully selecting the position of the UAV, we can further enhance the overall system performance.",

        "abstract": "Many Internet of Things (IoT) systems are based on the intercommunication among different devices and centralized systems. Nowadays, there are several commercial and research platforms available to simplify the creation of such IoT systems. However, developing these systems can often be a tedious task. To address this challenge, a proposed solution involves the implementation of a unified program or script that encompasses the entire system, including IoT devices functionality. This approach is based on an abstraction, integrating the control of the devices in a single program through a programmable object. Subsequently, the proposal processes the unified script to generate the centralized system code and a controller for each device. By adopting this approach, developers will be able to create IoT systems with significantly reduced implementation costs, surpassing current platforms by more than 10%. The results demonstrate that the single program approach can significantly accelerate the development of IoT systems relying on device communication.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the wide application of the Internet of Things (IoT), storing large amounts of IoT data and protecting data privacy has become a meaningful issue. In general, the access control mechanism is used to prevent illegal users from accessing private data. However, traditional data access control schemes face some non-ignorable problems, such as only supporting coarse-grained access control, the risk of centralization, and high trust issues. In this paper, an attribute-based data access control scheme using blockchain technology is proposed. To address these problems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has become a promising solution for encrypted data access control. Firstly, we utilize blockchain technology to construct a decentralized access control scheme, which can grant data access with transparency and traceability. Furthermore, our scheme also guarantees the privacy of policies and attributes on the blockchain network. Secondly, we optimize an ABE scheme, which makes the size of system parameters smaller and improves the efficiency of algorithms. These optimizations enable our proposed scheme supports large attribute universe requirements in IoT environments. Thirdly, to prohibit attribute impersonation and attribute replay attacks, we design a challenge-response mechanism to verify the ownership of attributes. Finally, we evaluate the security and performance of the scheme. And comparisons with other related schemes show the advantages of our proposed scheme. Compared to existing schemes, our scheme has more comprehensive advantages, such as supporting a large universe, full security, expressive policy, and policy hiding.",

To address this issue, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm allows the implementation of hyperlocal monitoring systems, typically using traditional cloud architectures, which can be enhanced using edge computing architectures. For this reason, we propose an IoT-Edge-Cloud architecture for a platform which promotes the early detection of unsafe environments through machine learning, composed of a sensing layer that collects all the data, an edge layer that performs the artificial intelligence tasks and a cloud layer orchestrating. This architecture is based on the FogFlow framework and the FIWARE components. Our solution proposes an embedded model that can predict the occurrence of PM values higher than the recommended onesâaccording to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) indicatorsâwith an 87 % of accuracy and a reduction of latency of 26 %. Our platform is innovative because it is based on the FogFlow framework for edge computing and supported by the Smart Spot device validated in a field test. This step is missing from similar state-of-the-art platforms. Thus, we believe that this work contributes to demonstrating the usefulness of AIoT to monitor workplace safety and make trustable predictions, avoiding risky environments.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (87KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has characteristics such as node mobility, node heterogeneity, link heterogeneity, and topology heterogeneity. In the face of the IoT characteristics and the explosive growth of IoT nodes, which brings about large-scale data processing requirements, edge computing architecture has become an emerging network architecture to support IoT applications due to its ability to provide powerful computing capabilities and good service functions. However, the defense mechanism of Edge Computing-enabled IoT Nodes (ECIoTNs) is still weak due to their limited resources, so that they are susceptible to malicious software spread, which can compromise data confidentiality and network service availability. Facing this situation, we put forward an epidemiology-based susceptible-curb-infectious-removed-dead (SCIRD) model. Then, we analyze the dynamics of ECIoTNs with different infection levels under different initial conditions to obtain the dynamic differential equations. Additionally, we establish the presence of equilibrium states in the SCIRD model. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis of the modelâs stability and examine the conditions under which malicious software will either spread or disappear within Edge Computing-enabled IoT (ECIoT) networks. Lastly, we validate the efficacy and superiority of the SCIRD model through MATLAB simulations. These research findings offer a theoretical foundation for suppressing the propagation of malicious software in ECIoT networks. The experimental results indicate that the theoretical SCIRD model has instructive significance, deeply revealing the principles of malicious software propagation in ECIoT networks. This study solves a challenging security problem of ECIoT networks by determining the malicious software propagation threshold, which lays the foundation for building more secure and reliable ECIoT networks.",

This is especially important when it comes to controlling long-term illnesses like high blood pressure, which raises the risk of heart disease considerably, especially in older people. This methodology achieves greater accuracy by combining regular medical monitoring and Electronic Clinical Data (ECD) from complete medical records with physical data from patients' routine medical monitoring. This innovative technique enhances the area of cardiac disease prediction. A technique that uses cutting-edge machine learning models and IoT technology to meet this demand. In particular, we use the powerful Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to effectively examine big datasets and extract important characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. The deep learning model Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used to further enhance prediction skills to extract complex temporal patterns from patient data. It outperformed naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests with our approach, achieving a greater prediction accuracy of 99.4â¯%. With the combination of Internet of Things technologies and sophisticated machine learning models, this paper offers a novel approach to remote healthcare monitoring.",

However, handling the massive data generated by IIoT poses challenges. To address this, we propose a software and hardware architecture that combines edge computing with IIoT to enable computer vision applications on manufacturing floors. This research contributes to integrating edge computing and IIoT with Computer Vision technologies in manufacturing facilities, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for machine vision applications. This approach benefits Small and Medium Manufacturers (SMMs) by utilizing low-cost hardware and open-source technologies, enabling them to harness Industry 4.0 advantages. Our approach involves IoT devices using Raspberry Pi microcomputers and USB webcams as clients and a Python-based edge node server software as the central component. Our test case study results show that a centralized edge-computing solution can offer several useability benefits and a significant performance increase over using a non-edge-enabled IIoT approach. The proposed architecture is tested, validated, and verified through a case study focused on the digitization of the readings of analog gauges. Our experimentation results can offer valuable insights and guidance for the broader adoption of edge-enabled IIoT solutions in manufacturing contexts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nProviding security to the Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most challenging and demanding tasks in improving the security of the network by detecting trust nodes in the path. High energy consumption, loss of data packets, and routing overheads are unsolvable issues in the existing security-aware routing methodologies. Energy Efficient Routing Establishment (EERE) scheme invokes hybrid whale positions integrated with the Flower Pollination Algorithm (WP-FPA) for optimal path allocation by calculating the energy level of nodes in the network. In addition, to ensure the security of the network, a trust evaluation factor has been performed to estimate the trust value for each participating node on the network by Aggregated Packet Control Trust Protocol (APCTP) . Security is improved by mitigating nodes in the path that are identified and it is eliminated by the trust evaluation factor and the node's neighboring information. The performance of the proposed security-based routing mechanisms is compared with metrics such as average residual energy, packet delivery ratio (PDR), packet delay, and network lifetime. The proposed EERE-APCTP mechanisms improve residual energy to 80% in stipulated node mobility. The packet delivery ratio is improved to 99% and network lifetime is increased to 265 milliseconds. Routing overhead is reduced to 0.6%.\nIndex Termsâ Whale Positions Integrated Flower Pollination Algorithm (WP-FPA), Mobile Ad-hoc security, Energy Efficient Routing Establishment (EERE), Trust Evaluation, MANET security, pollination optimization, Neighbor node feedback behavior.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCombining the metaverse and the Internet of Things (IoT) will lead to the development of diverse, virtual, and more advanced networks in the future. The integration of IoT networks with the metaverse will enable more meaningful connections between the 'real' and 'virtual' worlds, allowing for real-time data analysis, access, and processing. However, these metaverse-IoT networks will face numerous security and privacy threats. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) offer an effective means of early detection for such attacks. Nevertheless, the metaverse generates substantial volumes of data due to its interactive nature and the multitude of user interactions within virtual environments, posing a computational challenge for building an intrusion detection system. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection system model based on deep learning. This model aims to detect most attacks targeting metaverse-IoT communications and combines two techniques: KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis which was used for attack feature extraction and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for attack recognition and classification. The efficiency of this proposed IDS model is assessed using two widely recognized benchmark datasets, BoT-IoT and ToN-IoT, which contain various IoT attacks potentially targeting IoT communications. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed IDS model in identifying 12 classes of attacks relevant to metaverse-IoT, achieving a remarkable accuracy of\n99.8\n%\nand a False Negative Rate FNR less than\n0.2\n. Furthermore, when compared with other models in the literature, our IDS model demonstrates superior performance in attack detection accuracy.",

In this regard, developments in the field of effective and reliable means of defence against this type of threat, in particular, reliable methods for detecting, identifying, and countering botnet attacks, are becoming increasingly important and relevant. This paper presents a comprehensive study that applies machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest and XGBoost, to identify botnet attacks on IoT effectively. These algorithms are analyzed, compared, and shown to be highly effective in detecting complex patterns indicative of botnet activity, thus achieving a significant improvement in IoT security. The conducted research aims to make a useful contribution to the problem of securing WSNs and IoT in general. The results of the study demonstrated high accuracy in detecting attacks with an accuracy of 99.18% for XGBoost and Random Forest showed an accuracy of 99.21%. Thus, it was shown that the significance of applying machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost can be one of the key approaches in combating botnet attacks and securing the IoT.

This shift promises to boost the performance of IoT-based services, providing swift response times while conserving bandwidth. Despite their potential, the current Edge/Fog computing platforms must provide the required flexibility for dynamic service orchestration within a data-oriented context. Addressing this gap, the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model emerges as an exceptional strategy for Edge/Fog deployments. Its ability to manage an ever-expanding ecosystem of devices with remarkable flexibility and efficiency holds considerable promise. This paper articulates a novel approach to enhancing the adaptability of IoT Edge/Fog deployments. We propose an innovative extension to OpenStack, an open-source Cloud management system, which pushes its functionality towards the network Edge. Our approach empowers OpenStack to facilitate FaaS services within a distributed IoT infrastructure, thus infusing unprecedented adaptability and efficiency into the Edge/Fog computing paradigms.",

DTs are able to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to their behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a specific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different scenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how to deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios characterized by the usage of multiple data formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we propose the Relativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically generate general-purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models over time by constantly observing their real counterparts. The framework relies on the object representation via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a standardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs. To this purpose, we extended the W3C WoT standard in order to encompass the concept of behavioral model and define it in the Thing Description (TD) through a new vocabulary. Finally, we evaluated the RDT framework over two disjoint use cases to assess its correctness and learning performance, i.e., the DT of a simulated smart home scenario with the capability of forecasting the indoor temperature, and the DT of a real-world drone with the capability of forecasting its trajectory in an outdoor scenario. Experiments show that the generated DT can estimate the behavior of its real counterpart after an observation stage, regardless of the considered scenario.",

However, the intricate nature of IoT connections and device vulnerabilities exposes the devices to security threats. To address the security challenges, we propose a proactive defense framework that leverages a model-based approach for security analysis and facilitates the defense strategies. Our proposed approach incorporates proactive defense mechanisms that combine Moving Target Defense techniques with cyber deception. The proposed approach involves the use of a decoy nodes as a deception technique and operating system based diversity as a moving target defense strategy to change the attack surface area of IoT networks. Additionally, we introduce a technique known as Important Measure-based Operating System Diversity to reduce defense cost. The effectiveness of the defense mechanisms was evaluated by using a graphical security model in a Software Defined Networking-based IoT network. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating the impact of attacks while maintaining high performance levels in IoT networks.",

This has raised consumers awareness towards monitoring the resources of their food consumption. Nevertheless, greenwashing and deceptive food labels are prevalent leading to sales of items with misaligned labels, underpinning the need to authenticate, trace, and track the agricultural supply chain from the farm to shop. Consumers should be able to select fresh produce and verify its origin through a transparent, trustworthy, accountable, and reliable process. This paper introduces a blockchain-based solution that leverages intrinsic features of this innovative and disruptive technology to harness transparency, reliability, authenticity, and accountability within an agricultural supply chain. Additionally, our solution eliminates misleading food labels on fresh produce by enabling consumers to reliably trace and verify the origin and authenticity of the food source in a transparent manner. Through the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), the well-being of the soil, air, and crops is consistently monitored. The sustainable solutions employed are transparent, aligning with the standards set by various sustainable food certifications and agencies, including organic, non-Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). The paper presents detailed algorithms that represent the smart contract code, sequence diagrams along with testing results and security analysis. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.",

Mobile or multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been proposed for providing the computing resources close to the end devices that need them. However, in real network environments, MEC servers also have limited computing resources that need to be shared among many devices and efficient resource allocation is critical to ensure that the limited resources are optimally used. In view of this, we propose the Balanced Offload for Multi-type Tasks (BOMT) algorithm. The tasks to be offloaded are first prioritized according to their type, size and maximum tolerable delay; then different offloading algorithms are executed for different priority tasks according to the level of the priority and the current load on the MEC server. Following which, the optimal offloading policy is determined iteratively. Simulation results show that BOMT can effectively reduce system delay, increase user coverage and offload task completion rates.",

With the widespread use of this technology, an unprecedented number of IoT endpoints, including devices in our homes, are now connected to external networks. Firmware of this type is typically heterogeneous and closed source. At the firmware level, it is harder to detect and evaluate security vulnerabilities since their effects are faster and larger. In recent years, several similarity-based firmware security detection techniques and tools have become research hotspots. Security concerns and attacks have risen to the top of the list for IoT security equipment, particularly IoT cameras.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs technological communication progresses, diverse datasets are exchanged across distributed environments using the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the IoT environment is vulnerable to attacking and breaching data privacy or making a robust system worse by providing attack data. To address potential risks of attacks, researchers have been conducting experiments on network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) to mitigate threats effectively. The issue of data imbalance and associated data collection costs persists, hindering the ability of machine learning (ML) models to learn malicious behaviour effectively and consequently impacting the accuracy of network threat detection. Addressing these issues, our study explores the potential of using 100% synthetic data generated via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for training ML models in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). This approach reduces the dependency on real-world data significantly, paving the way for a more flexible and ethically convenient model-building process. For the UNSW-NB15 dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 90%, a precision of 91%, a recall of 90%, and an F1 score of 89%. For the NSL-KDD dataset, our results showed an accuracy of 84%, a precision of 85%, a recall of 84%, and an F1 score of 84%. For the BoT-IoT dataset, we attained perfect scores of 100% across all metrics. These outcomes indicate that the values obtained from our analysis demonstrate high performance, yielding comparative or superior results to previous studies. Therefore, our study successfully replicates real-world network intrusion detection data, showing new opportunities for the use of generative data in cyber security.",

        "abstract": "The rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) across industries has revolutionized daily life by providing essential services and leisure activities. However, the inadequate software protection in IoT devices exposes them to cyberattacks with severe consequences. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are vital in mitigating these risks by detecting abnormal network behavior and monitoring safe network traffic. The security research community has shown particular interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) approaches to develop practical IDS applications for general cyber networks and IoT environments. However, most available datasets related to Industrial IoT suffer from imbalanced class distributions. This study proposes a methodology that involves dataset preprocessing, including data cleaning, encoding, and normalization. The class imbalance is addressed by employing the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and performing feature reduction using correlation analysis. Multiple ML classifiers, including Logistic Regression, multi-layer perceptron, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are employed to model IoT attacks. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method evaluate using the IoTID20 dataset, which represents current imbalanced IoT scenarios. The results highlight that the XGBoost model, integrated with SMOTE, achieves outstanding attack detection accuracy of 0.99 in binary classification, 0.99 in multi-class classification, and 0.81 in multiple sub-classifications. These findings demonstrate our approachâs significant improvements to attack detection in imbalanced IoT datasets, establishing its superiority over existing IDS frameworks.",

It has turned out to be a crucial development for harnessing the incredible power of wireless media in the real world. The nature of IoT-Fog networks requires the use of defense techniques who are light and mobile-aware. The edge resources in such a distributed environment are open to various safety hazards. DDoS UDP flooding attacks are the most frequent threats to edge resources in IoT-Fog networks. It is crucial for sabotaging fog gateways and can overcome traditional data filtering techniques. This paper introduces M-RL, a lightweight intrusion detection system with mobility awareness that can detect DDoS UDP flooding attacks while taking into account adversarial IoT devices that engage in IP spoofing. To this end, this paper analyzes the malicious behaviors that result in anonymity against Rate Limiting and Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches, combines their advantages, and addresses their vulnerabilities. We test our method in different contexts to achieve that goal, and we find that it may decrease the accuracy of the RL, RSS, and RSS-RL methods to 70%, 48.9%, and 64.3%, respectively. The outcomes demonstrate the proposed approach's resistance to software-based source address forgery, impersonation, and signal modification. It offers more than 99% accuracy and supports node mobility. In this case, the best possible accuracy of the previous methods is 77%.",

Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.",

With the increasing global concern for waste management and sustainable practices, the integration of IoT and smart bins brings forth a multitude of benefits. These include heightened efficiencies, reduced costs, and improved accuracy in waste collection. By integrating IoT sensors into traditional waste bins, these smart bins can gather data regarding the fill levels of waste. This enables waste collectors to optimize their routes and collection schedules, resulting in a more streamlined process. The collected data is securely transmitted to the relevant stakeholders and it is recorded on a blockchain-based platform to enhance transparency and accountability. The incorporation of security measures ensures the privacy and integrity of the collected data throughout the entire data transmission process. This paper emphasizes the immense potential of utilizing IoT and smart bin technologies to revolutionize waste collection practices, thereby contributing to a more efficient and sustainable recycling ecosystem.",

Attackers and defenders are normally the same entity; a detailed knowledge of defensive strategies optimises an attack whereas a good defence, based on a layered structure also includes attacks. In addition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new techniques and tools to both attackers and defenders such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on Generators and Discriminators for impersonation or Deep Learning (DL) for exhaustive scanning. To address this dilemma, this article presents CyberAIBot: Artificial Intelligence in an Intrusion Detection System for CyberSecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT) aimed at Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) network traffic. CyberAIBot is based on a Deep Learning management structure in a private or local edge cloud computing approach where AI makes decisions as close as possible to the source of data. CyberAIBot gradually detects, learns, and adapts to different cyber attacks. In detail, CyberAIBot uses Deep Learning (DL) technical clusters trained in specific attacks and a Deep Learning (DL) management cluster specialises in taking management decisions rather than technical evaluations. This management cluster supervises conflicting classifications from the deep learning technical clusters. CyberAIbot is trained against several datasets and its performance is evaluated between two classification algorithms, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVM DL clusters learn faster (average 15x) although the LSTM DL clusters perform better (average 30%). The LSTM DL management cluster performs better than the SVM DL management cluster although it recognises fewer traffic types. The total number of data points analysed by CyberAIBot is 5.52E+08, equivalent to the distance between the planet Earth to the Moon in meters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article examines the needs of future solar photovoltaic modules in relation to monitoring and optimizing their performance, and it presents the design of a new IoT module that aims to meet these needs. The proposed IoT Module provides a hardware and software platform applied to individual PV panels within PV strings. It introduces innovative capabilities such as real-time and precise monitoring at high rate for individual PV panels, local processing of collected information within the module, and active control actions at PV panel level. These actions include connection/disconnection and active bypass within the PV string, both during daylight generation and dark EL testing conditions. The IoT module allows each panel to acquire electrical and environmental data, trace IâV curves, reconfigure its connections within a PV string, and conduct individual EL testing. It also incorporates Wi-Fi and BLE communication protocols, enabling communication with other panels and IoT devices. Thus, it can coordinate certain reconfiguration actions and locally apply distributed algorithms for edge computing. As an example, a distributed algorithm for marginal partial-shading anomaly detection is included to demonstrate the abilities of the IoT Modules to self-diagnose and perform edge-computing processing. The functionality and performance of the IoT Module are verified through simulations and experimental tests. The results confirm that the designed IoT module provides a novel monitoring and management solution for PV panels, enabling them to enhance their performance and progress towards PV digitization.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHistorically Pandemic and Epidemic Prone (PEP) diseases rapidly inflame the respiratory tract and influence heart rate very badly, like how corona virus 2019 was transmitted by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article proposes a conceptual design that considers heart rate change, and respiration rate variations measured are indicated through IoT with a mobile application. Here the app-based method solves the connectivity gap through technology infusion, which was needed during pandemic. Since wearable devices to measure heart rate/ respiratory rate are commonly available, here the proposal suggests one such best-suited wearable strain sensor to focus on respiration rate and volume of a human respiratory system with high fidelity for servicing PEP patients. The proposed concept can help in monitoring and tracking multiple patients simultaneously, online through Internet of Things (IoT). This IoT enabled app not only updates doctors on already discharged patients, but also can be used by anyone to prevent last minute uncertainties. Since respiratory issues being one of the main symptoms of patients recovered from PEP disease, tracking the breathing patterns is essential. This issue requires an effective sensorics system and associated software applications, thus connecting hospital administration to the public. The aim is to help the public use a single software application to access the ambulance, hospital, and doctors, reducing time via data transfer leveraging IoT. This has been simulated using Cisco packet tracer for fast processing of data and the results are observed. As a pre-requisite of the application respiratory rate data set has been converted and the required alert indications have been shown after comparing with reference data set.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides superior results in effectively addressing complex transportation challenges. Predicting vehicle traffic, crashes, demand, location, communication, and travel safety are all critical issues in todayâs transportation systems. The proposed paper optimizes vehicle traffic by incorporating reroute recommendations, increasing the use of public transportation, and providing onboard vehicle drivers with intelligent health assistance using Federated Learning (FL). This research also focuses on resolving complex transportation issues such as a vehicleâs current location, exact vehicle count information on each route, and onboard vehicle vacant seat information. Furthermore, vehicle communication contributes to the proposed systemâs efficiency by avoiding communication delays or information loss to registered users and the cloud server. An intelligent FL-based scheme for vehicle route optimization has been proposed as part of this research to prevent vehicle traffic in a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) connected IoV transportation system. The vehicle detection approach determines the number of vehicles traveling on each route to recommend the best route to registered users. The effective implementation of cluster-based vehicle communication and location estimation models enhances the efficiency of the proposed system.",

The antenna is built on a Rogers RT-5880 substrate with dimensions of 32 Ã 32 Ã 1.6 mmÂ³. This integration increased the isolation from 18 dB to 27 dB in the MW band and 28 dBâ40 dB in the MMW band. The effective bandwidths for the MW and MMW bands were initially 3.3â3.7 GHz, 5.45â9.2 GHz, and 24â28 GHz, respectively. The MTM increased these bandwidths to 2.6â4.1 GHz, 5.3â11.3 GHz for the MW band, and 22.5â29.3 GHz for the MMW band. In addition, the realized gain increased significantly, from 1.5 dBi, 3.5 dBi, and 6.5 dBi to 4.5 dBi, 6.1 dBi, and 11 dBi at 3.5 GHz, 6.9 GHz, and 28 GHz. The antenna's overall efficiency increased by 10â12 % across all operational bandwidths. The suggested antenna has excellent diversity performance, with an envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.0002, a diversity gain greater than 9.998, and a channel capacity loss of less than 0.12 bits/s/Hz. The proposed antenna addresses the increasing demand for IoT devices by efficiently supporting both MW and MMW frequency bands, offering high performance in wireless communication and modern infrastructures. The proposed design not only improves connectivity and efficiency in IoT devices but also supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by contributing to the development of smart city infrastructure (SDG 11) and fostering innovation and sustainable industrial practices (SDG 9), thereby promoting sustainable development and industrial innovation.",

The associative nonlinear effects of a variety of undesirable power quality concerns were resolved by using harmonic mitigation in nonlinear loads and high-performance converters were built on power electronics in conventional systems. Among other performance objectives, total harmonic (THD) distortion analysis and higher order harmonics mitigation is given main concern in smart electronics equipment. This paper proposes an approach to minimize higher-order harmonics due to nonlinear load disturbances in smart IoT devices using the TakagiâSugeno (TS) Neuro Fuzzy (TS-ANFIS) supervised shunt APF. The proposed work elicits the novel adaptive harmonic mitigation technique in hybrid IoT embedded systems to protect from malfunctioning and to deal with the uncertainty of harmonic signal stimuli in sensitive sensors-based IoT systems. Hysteresis current control is used for the ignition of reference signal under uncertainty of harmonic stimuli. The single phase shunt APF is used to mitigate higher-order harmonics from supply mains, while the implementation of TS-ANFIS supervises the controller action to generate a trigger signal for adequate single phase APF gate excitation. The higher order harmonic current data set is used for error deviation for training neural networks and adaptive control. The estimated adoption of the neuron's empirical weight reduces the total THD to a significant reduction rate of 72.8 % to 0.78 %. The control mechanism is feasible for a range of smart IoT systems to adhere to the standard of 519 (IEEE).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) has been rapidly growing to make a stronger influence on huge industrial systems. Since cybercriminals have made IoT a target for harmful operations such as botnets, an attack on the end nodes is now a possibility. Protecting IoT infrastructure with a typical intrusion detection system is difficult because of its vastness, variety, and minimal resource availability. Harmful \"bot sourcesâ (servers) control a botnet, which is made up of hacked devices that are employed for several illicit purposes like sending spam, initiating DoS attacks, and stealing personal data. Because bot sources generate network traffic while conversing with their bots, Intrusion Detection Systems could benefit from analyzing traffic on the network to detect Botnet traffic. DDoS attacks and spam distribution are common uses for botnets.\nAs machine learning (ML) approaches are employed in various niches of security, it appears practical and workable to use ML to detect botnets. ML has been used in various researches to detect botnets. However, the results are either unreliable or limited to certain types of botnets or devices. Current approaches attempt to solve these issues by presenting models that are trained on botnet features, but the large dimensionality of feature values and the reliance on botnet features alone are serious drawbacks. In order to address these constraints, a novel botnet and its impact detection by a typical ensemble classification approach has been proposed by the current work. The framework uses the correlated traffic-flow and botnet features to train the classifier, which is titled as \"Ensemble Classification to Predict Botnet and its Impact (EC-PBI) on IoT Networks\". The experimental study is a cross validation approach that is performed using a multi-label, fourfold strategy. Performance analysis of the proposed approach was done by comparing it with contemporary models. Results prove its efficiency in detecting botnet and its impact.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) is being widely developed in various fields, and its penetration rate in daily life is continuously increasing. The nature of the social function of objects and giving them an identity has made it possible to successfully integrate this technology into many traditional systems and improve their performance by automation. Libraries are one of the most obvious examples of smartening by IoT architecture. So far, various architectures have been presented for smartening libraries through IoT technology. However, a low-cost and ideal architecture that can cover all the requirements in a wide range of smart library applications has not been provided. This article attempts to fill some of the existing research gaps in this field by presenting a new architecture for smartening libraries. In the proposed method, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is used to reduce implementation costs and improve the management process of network components. In this architecture, the communication platform of network active objects is formed based on a cluster-based topology. Also, passive Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags are utilized to manage books and library property. Two stages of evaluation have been conducted for the suggested method's performance: actual deployment and computer simulations. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that this study has succeeded in creating an effective and affordable design for smart libraries, which is a major advancement over conventional libraries.",

While prior research has examined the adoption of IoT for healthcare, there is a notable absence of exploration regarding the influence of COVID-19-related factors, such as fear and desire for self-care, on user engagement with IoT devices and their determining factors. A quantitative study using the partial least squares algorithm was conducted to analyze this gap. The mediating role of the desire for self-care between fear and social influences, on the one hand, and engagement in using this technology, on the other, was confirmed by adopting the Macro Process on SPSS.1 The study results make it possible to put forward several interesting recommendations that facilitate the long-term adoption of the Internet of Things for health. The mediating role of the desire for self-care in the relationship between fear and user engagement explains that IoT users who are afraid of catching COVID-19 will be more concerned about health monitoring, leading them to adopt this technology of IoT devices.",

The main problem is the high cost of managing X.509 certificates throughout their lifecycle, from installation to regular updates and revocation. The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralized option that reduces the need for human intervention, and therefore has the potential to significantly reduce the complexity and cost associated to identity management in large-scale IoT systems. However, to leverage the full potential of SSI, the authentication of IoT nodes needs to be moved from the application to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) level. This paper contributes to the adoption of SSI in large-scale IoT systems by addressing, for the first time, the extension of the original TLS 1.3 handshake to support two new SSI authentication modes while maintaining the interoperability with nodes implementing the original handshake protocol. The open source implementation of the new TLS 1.3 handshake protocol in OpenSSL is used to experimentally prove the feasibility of the approach.",

As a consequence, the prompt detection of attacks in IoT environments through the use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has become essential. This article proposes a novel approach to intrusion detection in IoT based on a stacking ensemble of deep learning (DL) models. This approach is named Deep Integrated Stacking for the IoT (DIS-IoT) and it combines four different DL models into a fully connected DL layer, creating a standalone ensemble model. DIS-IoT is evaluated on three open-source datasets, namely ToN_IoT, CICIDS2017 and SWaT, in binary and multi-class classification and compared results with other standard DL methods. Experiments demonstrate that DIS-IoT is capable of a high-level accuracy with a very low False Positive rate (FPR) in all datasets. Results were also compared against other state-of-the-art works available in the literature, which used similar methods on the same ToN_IoT dataset. DIS-IoT achieves comparable performance with others in binary classification and outperforms them in multi-class classification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccording to previous studies, one of the major causes of 20 % to 25 % of neonatal deaths is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Early identification, progressive monitoring, and treatment and/or management of neonatal RDS can substantially increase the rate of survival in neonates. However, global research indicates frequent shortages and burnout among nursing staff, especially in postpartum units, contributing to the difficulty in early identification of RDS in neonates. Clinicians currently use breathing sounds and frequency as key criteria in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) for identifying and treating RDS. In practice, the monitoring of respiratory signal abnormalities relies on sensor patches, which frequently detach from the neonatesâ slippery skin, leading to potential skin injuries and unstable signal reception. This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based contactless neonatal respiratory monitoring system that integrates computer vision (CV), beamforming microphone array (BFMA), and millimeter Wave (mmWave) radar, all connected to a cloud platform. Clinical trials revealed that CV-based neonatal feature identification achieved over 96 % accuracy within 40 cm to 120 cm. The neonatal breathing sound strengthening, utilized CV and BFMA, achieved an average sound-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5.07 dB, and CV with mmWave radar reduced chest displacement signal error from 0.66 to 0.26 BPM. Additionally, survey results showed that doctors and clinical personnel were satisfied with the system's functionality and usability. This demonstrates the system's ability to assist in monitoring respiratory signals of swaddled neonates and in the early identification of neonatal RDS, with further applications in neonatal care at postpartum centers.",

Moreover, these applications act as the building blocks of IoT-enabled smart cities. The high volume and high velocity of data generated by various smart city applications are sent to flexible and efficient cloud computing resources for processing. However, there is a high computation latency due to the presence of a remote cloud server. Edge computing, which brings the computation close to the data source is introduced to overcome this problem. In an IoT-enabled smart city environment, one of the main concerns is to consume the least amount of energy while executing tasks that satisfy the delay constraint. An efficient resource allocation at the edge is helpful to address this issue. In this paper, an energy and delay minimization problem in a smart city environment is formulated as a bi-objective edge resource allocation problem. First, we presented a three-layer network architecture for IoT-enabled smart cities. Then, we designed a learning automata-based edge resource allocation approach considering the three-layer network architecture to solve the said bi-objective minimization problem. Learning Automata (LA) is a reinforcement-based adaptive decision-maker that helps to find the best task and edge resource mapping. An extensive set of simulations is performed to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the LA-based approach in the IoT-enabled smart city environment.",

        "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have always been a major concern in the security field. With the release of malware source codes such as BASHLITE and Mirai, Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become the new source of DDoS attacks against many Internet applications. Although there are many datasets in the field of IoT intrusion detection, such as Bot-IoT, Constrained Application ProtocolâDenial of Service (CoAP-DoS), and LATAM-DDoS-IoT (some of the names of DDoS datasets), which mainly focus on DDoS attacks, the datasets describing new IoT DDoS attack scenarios are extremely rare, and only N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets used IoT devices as DDoS attackers in the construction process, while they did not use Internet applications as victims either. To supplement the description of the new trend of DDoS attacks in the dataset, we built an IoT environment with mainstream DDoS attack tools such as Mirai and BASHLITE being used to infect IoT devices and implement DDoS attacks against WEB servers. Then, data aggregated into a dataset named MBB-IoT were captured at WEB servers and IoT nodes. After the MBB-IoT dataset was split into a training set and a test set, it was applied to the training and testing of the Random Forests classification algorithm. The multi-class classification metrics were good and all above 90%. Secondly, in a cross-evaluation experiment based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) classification algorithms, the training set and test set were derived from different datasets (MBB-IoT or IoT-23), and the test performance is better when MBB-IoT is used as the training set.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe contemporary era is experiencing an unprecedented dependence on data generated by individuals via an array of interconnected devices constituting the Internet of Things (IoT). The information amassed through IoT devices serves many objectives, including prescriptive analytics and predictive maintenance, preemptive healthcare measures, disaster mitigation, operational efficiency, and increased yield. In contrast, most applications or systems that rely on user-generated data to fulfill their business objectives face challenges in adhering to privacy protocols. Consequently, users are exposed to many privacy risks. Such infringements upon privacy provisions give rise to apprehensions regarding the authenticity of the processed data. Hence, this paper presents the weaknesses and challenges in current practices and proposes âPrivySeCâ, a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based framework for privacy preserving and secure sharing of personally and non-personally identifiable information. The security analysis indicates that the proposed solution ensures data privacy by design and complies with most of the requirements mandated by various privacy regulations. Similarly, PrivySeC promises low transaction latency and provides high throughput. Although we have created a privacy-preserving solution for sharing smart farm data, it can be customized to meet the specific privacy requirements of individual applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a key enabler for critical systems, but IoT devices are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks due to their diffusion and hardware and software limitations. This calls for designing and evaluating new effective approaches for protecting IoT systems at the network level. While recent proposals based on machine- and deep-learning provide effective solutions to the problem of attack-traffic classification, their adoption is severely challenged by the amount of labeled traffic they require to train the classification models. In fact, this results in the need for collecting and labeling large amounts of malicious traffic, which may be hindered by the nature of the malware possibly generating little and hard-to-capture network activity. To tackle this challenge, we adopt few-shot learning approaches for attack-traffic classification, with the objective to improve detection performance for attack classes with few labeled samples. We leverage advanced deep-learning architectures to perform feature extraction and provide an extensive empirical studyâusing recent and publicly available datasetsâcomparing the performance of an ample variety of solutions based on different learning paradigms, and exploring a number of design choices in depth (impact of embedding function, number of classes of attacks, or number of attack samples). In comparison to non-few-shot baselines, we achieve a relative improvement in the F\n-score ranging from 8% to 27%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditional approaches to monitoring water quality in aquaculture tanks present numerous limitations, including the inability to provide real-time data, which can lead to improper feeding practices, reduced productivity, and potential environmental risks. To address these challenges, this study aimed to create an accurate water quality monitoring system for Asian seabass fish farming in aquaculture tanks. This was achieved by enhancing the accuracy of low-cost sensors using simple linear regression and validating the IoT system data with YSI Professional Pro. The system's development and validation were conducted over three months, employing professional devices for accuracy assessment. The accuracy of low-cost sensors was significantly improved through simple linear regression. The results demonstrated impressive accuracy levels ranging from 76% to 97%. The relative error values which range from 0.27% to 4% demonstrate a smaller range compared to the values obtained from the YSI probe during the validation process, signifying the enhanced accuracy and reliability of the IoT sensor by using simple linear regression. The system's enhanced accuracy facilitates convenient and reliable real-time water quality monitoring for aquafarmers. Real-time data visualization was achieved through a microcontroller, Thingspeak, Virtuino application, and ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, providing comprehensive insights into water quality conditions. Overall, this adaptable tool holds promise for accurate water quality management in diverse aquatic farming practices, ultimately leading to improved yields and sustainability.",

In this model, an event (e.g., an input from a sensor, or a device state update) can trigger an ECA rule, whose execution can cause the state update of (possibly) many remote devices at once; the latter are selected âon the flyâ by means of predicates over their state, without the need of a central coordinating entity.\nHowever, the combination of different systems may yield unexpected interactions, e.g., when a new device is added to an existing secure system, potentially hindering the security of the whole ensemble of devices. This can be critical in the IoT, where smart devices are more and more pervasive in our daily life.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of ensuring security and safety requirements for systems (and, in turn, for IoT devices). The first are a form of noninterference, as they correspond to avoid forbidden information flows (e.g., information flows violating confidentiality); while the second are a form of non-interaction, as they correspond to avoid unintended executions (e.g., leading to erroneous/unsafe states).\nIn order to formally model these requirements, we introduce suitable behavioral equivalences for . These equivalences are generalizations of hiding bisimilarity, i.e., a kind of weak bisimilarity where we can compare systems up to actions at different levels of security. Leveraging these behavioral equivalences, we propose (syntactic) sufficient conditions guaranteeing the requirements and, then, effective algorithms for statically verifying such conditions.",

In this paper, we compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms for building IDS, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Ada Boost, and support vector machine (SVM), using the IoTID20 dataset. This dataset has three target classes, including a binary class for normal or abnormal behavior and classes for categories and sub-categories of the binary class. We select the most relevant features to minimize execution time and improve accuracy. Our results show that the decision tree algorithm generally achieved the highest accuracy at 99.80% with the lowest error rate compared to the other algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe port of Tanger Med stands as the first port in Africa and the Mediterranean, with a throughput capacity of up to 9 million TEUs annually, accommodating the globe's largest vessels, such as ULCVs and MGX-24 classes, which boast capacities nearing 24,000 TEUs. To advance the safety and efficiency of handling deep-drafted vessels, the Tanger Med Port Authority, in cooperation with other terminals partners, try to deploy a sophisticated IoT-based system. This system integrates a high-precision non-linear 3D sea-keeping engine with detailed metocean forecasts, encompassing data on waves, winds, and other hydrodynamic factors. This IoT solution has been instrumental as a decision-support tool, facilitating the Harbormaster and Pilot teams in safely managing vessel transits. It has enabled an increase in the maximum allowable draft to 17.4 meters without requiring dredging. This paper delves into a model validation study assessing the effectiveness of the IoT solution in enhancing dynamic under-keel clearance management at Port Tanger Med, underlining its crucial role in improving operational efficiencies and ensuring navigational safety.",

Edge computing involves the proximity of computational resources to the devices and sensors responsible for data generation, reducing delay and improving real time data processing capabilities. EdgeX is an openly available framework designed for edge computing. that provides a platform for building IoT services and applications. In this paper, we evaluate the EdgeX open edge server for use in IoT services. We first deploy a web service application into the edge using a specific port, and then test the EdgeX server to see whether it can be used as a reliable and effective open-source edge server. Our results show that the EdgeX server is capable of supporting IoT services and can be used as an open-source edge server for a variety of applications. We conclude that EdgeX is a valuable resource for developing edge computing solutions, and that the open edge server can significantly contribute to the advancement of forthcoming IoT service innovations.",

Since 2017, the use of Digital Twins has been increasing. However, in the road transport and logistics realm, the adoption rate remains low, primarily due to the costs of processing and validating data in centralised scenarios, among other factors. On the other hand, Blockchain technologies were created to provide immutable and decentralised data storage in diverse scenarios, adding a layer of isolation and reliability in heterogeneous solutions. This paper presents a case study proposing a Digital Twin based on open-source Blockchain technologies, such as FIWARE Canis Major. The primary goal is to design and implement a robust and efficient open-source architecture that allows for the control and optimisation of vehicle fleet allocations in logistics/transport companies within supply chain management. This case study aims to showcase the practical application of the proposed solution in a real-world context, providing insights into its eco-friendly and low-cost attributes while opening the door to a large number of additional applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAttacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become increasingly sophisticated. However, there exist few comprehensive security investigations of IoT devices. We conducted a large-scale systematic investigation by assessing IoT firmware and follow-up survey with professionals involved in IoT-device manufacturing to understand the factors that prevent software security of IoT devices. Consequently, we discovered that many IoT devices continue to use old processor architecture and operating systems that are unable to efficiently use existing attack-mitigation features. Furthermore, we demonstrated that software patches are sometimes implicitly applied without changing the software version number (implicit patching); this may generate false positives in existing vulnerability assessments relying on software versions. On the basis of a follow-up survey, we determined technical and contractual constraints to IoT security emanating from the supply chain in the IoT device manufacturing industry. Based on the results, we discuss challenges associated with secure IoT manufacturing in the IoT-device supply chain.",

However, the application domains of IoT-enabled models often face resource limitations, requiring rapid responses, low latency, and large bandwidth, surpassing their inherent capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a fishnet approach-based packet scheduling and resource allocation system, termed Fishnet-6G, to optimize network resource allocation in the proposed 6G networks. Initially, we constructed a Sierpinski Triangle-based network in a 6G-IoT environment, enhancing device connectivity. We utilize the Quantum Density Peak Clustering (QDPC) algorithm to perform clustering for IoT devices, establishing Cluster Head (CH) and Substitute CH (SUB CH) based on actual metrics. Furthermore, traffic prediction is achieved through two processes, grouping, and fair queue status, using the Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMPDDPG) algorithm with a variable sampling rate, resulting in well-organized packet scheduling. Subsequently, we perform optimal packet scheduling by employing the Willow Catkin Optimization (WCO) algorithm, and the scheduled packets are managed within a Fishing Net Topology to reduce energy consumption and system complexity. Finally, we allocate the scheduled packets to the desired resource blocks using the Bayesian Game-Theoretic Approach (BGTA). The proposed approach is implemented using Network Simulator-3.26, and the performance of the Fishnet-6G model is evaluated based on time, transmission rate, energy efficiency, average throughput, latency, and Packet loss rate. Numerical analysis demonstrates that Fishnet-6G outperforms existing approaches across these metrics, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of 6G-IoT networks.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (456KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the rapid growth of the types and number of connected devices and has generated large amounts of complex and diverse traffic data. Traffic identification on edge servers solves the real-time and privacy requirements of IoT management and has attracted much attention, but still faces several problems: (1) traditional machine learning (ML) models rely on artificially constructed features, and the existing deep learning (DL) traffic identification models have reached their performance limit; and (2) insufficient computing resources of edge servers limit the possible improvement in the performance of deep learning models by increasing the number of parameters and structural complexity. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight fusion model. First, the Network-in-Network (NiN) model and Random Forest (RF) model are used on the cloud server to construct a traffic identification fusion model. The excellent representation extraction capability of the NiN compensates for the RFâs dependence on manual feature extraction, and its modular structure is suitable for the subsequent model compression operations. Then, the NiN was distilled. We propose Growth-Adaptive Distillation to lightweight the NiN model, which can reduce the operation of manually adjusting the structure of the student model and ensure the efficiency and low power consumption of the fusion model deployment. In addition, both the RF in the cloud and the distilled NiN are deployed on the edge server. Comparisons with multiple algorithms on two network traffic datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance while ensuring the use of minimal computational resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid advancement in sensors and communications has led to the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) services, where many devices need access to the transport network using fixed or wireless access technologies and mobile Radio Access Networks (RAN). However, supporting IoT in RAN is challenging as IoT services may produce many short and variable sessions, impacting the performance of mobile users sharing the same RAN. To address this issue, network slicing is a promising solution to support heterogeneous service segments sharing the same RAN, which is a crucial requirement of the upcoming fifth-generation (5G) mobile network. This paper proposes a two-level network slicing mechanism for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency communications (URLLC) in order to provide end-to-end slicing at the core and edge of the network with the aim of reducing latency for IoT services and mobile users sharing the same core and RAN using the O-RAN architecture. The problem is modeled at both levels as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved using hierarchical reinforcement learning. At a high level, an SDN controller using an agent that has been trained by a Double Deep Q-network (DDQN) allocates radio resources to gNodeBs (next-generation NodeB, a 5G base station) based on the requirements of eMBB and URLLC services. At a low level, each gNodeB using an agent that has been trained by a DDQN allocates its pre-allocated resources to its end-users. The proposed approach has been demonstrated and validated through a real testbed. Notably, it surpasses the prevalent approaches in terms of end-to-end latency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of low-power, cost-efficient internet-connected devices has led to a need for lightweight cryptography. The lightweight block cipher PRIDE, designed by Martin R. Albrecht, is one of the most efficient ciphers designed for IoT-constrained environments. It is useful for connected devices, requires fewer resources to implement, and has high performance. PRIDE is a software-oriented lightweight cipher optimized for microcontrollers. This paper focuses on the FPGA implementation of the PRIDE cipher by keeping throughput, energy, and power consumption metrics focused. The paper also presents a novel and simpler diagrammatical view of a Matrix Layer implementation of the PRIDE cipher. We also implemented the PRESENT cipher using the same metrics. We analyzed different design metrics on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and compared the metrics of the PRIDE implementation with the well-known cipher PRESENT. This gives us an insight into the efficiency and reliability of PRIDE in IoT-constrained environments. We also proposed different architectures of the PRIDE cipher for 16-bit and 32-bit datapaths.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe core missions of IoT are to sense data, transmit data and give feedback to the real world based on the calculation of the sensed data. The trust of sensing source data and transmission network is extremely important to IoT security. 5G-IoT with its low latency, wide connectivity and high-speed transmission extends the business scenarios of IoT, yet it also brings new challenges to trust proof solutions of IoT. Currently, there is a lack of efficient and reliable trust proof solutions for massive dynamically connected nodes, while the existing solutions have high computational complexity and can't adapt to time-sensitive services in 5G-IoT scenarios. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an adaptive multi-dimensional trust proof solution. Firstly, the static and dynamic attributes of sensing nodes are metricized, and the historical interaction as well as the recommendation information are combined with the comprehensive metric of sensing nodes, and a multi-dimensional fine-grained trusted metric model is established in this paper. Then, based on the comprehensive metrics, the sensing nodes are logically grouped and assigned with service levels to achieve the screening and isolation of malicious nodes. At the same time, the proposed solution reduces the energy consumption of the metric process and optimizes the impact of real-time metrics on the interaction latency. Simulation experiments show that the solution can accurately and efficiently identify malicious nodes and effectively guarantee the safe and trustworthy operation of 5G-IoT nodes, while having a small impact on the latency of the 5G network.",

Since 2017, the use of Digital Twins has been increasing. However, in the road transport and logistics realm, the adoption rate remains low, primarily due to the costs of processing and validating data in centralised scenarios, among other factors. On the other hand, Blockchain technologies were created to provide immutable and decentralised data storage in diverse scenarios, adding a layer of isolation and reliability in heterogeneous solutions. This paper presents a case study proposing a Digital Twin based on open-source Blockchain technologies, such as FIWARE Canis Major. The primary goal is to design and implement a robust and efficient open-source architecture that allows for the control and optimisation of vehicle fleet allocations in logistics/transport companies within supply chain management. This case study aims to showcase the practical application of the proposed solution in a real-world context, providing insights into its eco-friendly and low-cost attributes while opening the door to a large number of additional applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditional partial synchronous Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols are confronted with new challenges when applied to large-scale networks like IoT systems, which bring about rigorous demand for the liveness and consensus efficiency of BFT protocols in asynchronous network environments. HoneyBadgerBFT is the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which employs a reliable broadcast protocol (RBC) to broadcast transactions and an asynchronous binary agreement protocol (ABA) to determine whether transactions should be committed. DumboBFT is a follow-up proposal that requires fewer instances of ABA and achieves higher throughput than HoneyBadgerBFT, but it does not optimize the communication overhead of HoneyBadgerBFT.\nIn this paper, we propose TortoiseBFT, a high-performance asynchronous BFT protocol with three stages. We can significantly reduce communication overhead by determining the order of transactions first and requesting missing transactions after. Our two-phase transaction recovery mechanism enables nodes to recover missing transactions by seeking help from\nnodes. To improve the overall throughput of the system, we lower the verification overhead of threshold signatures in HoneyBadgerBFT, DumboBFT, and DispersedLedger from\nto\n. We develop a node reputation model that selects producers with stable network conditions, which helps to reduce the number of random lotteries. Experimental results show that TortoiseBFT improves system throughput, reduces transaction delays, and minimizes communication overhead compared to HoneyBadgerBFT, DumboBFT, and DispersedLedger.",

However, the application domains of IoT-enabled models often face resource limitations, requiring rapid responses, low latency, and large bandwidth, surpassing their inherent capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a fishnet approach-based packet scheduling and resource allocation system, termed Fishnet-6G, to optimize network resource allocation in the proposed 6G networks. Initially, we constructed a Sierpinski Triangle-based network in a 6G-IoT environment, enhancing device connectivity. We utilize the Quantum Density Peak Clustering (QDPC) algorithm to perform clustering for IoT devices, establishing Cluster Head (CH) and Substitute CH (SUB CH) based on actual metrics. Furthermore, traffic prediction is achieved through two processes, grouping, and fair queue status, using the Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMPDDPG) algorithm with a variable sampling rate, resulting in well-organized packet scheduling. Subsequently, we perform optimal packet scheduling by employing the Willow Catkin Optimization (WCO) algorithm, and the scheduled packets are managed within a Fishing Net Topology to reduce energy consumption and system complexity. Finally, we allocate the scheduled packets to the desired resource blocks using the Bayesian Game-Theoretic Approach (BGTA). The proposed approach is implemented using Network Simulator-3.26, and the performance of the Fishnet-6G model is evaluated based on time, transmission rate, energy efficiency, average throughput, latency, and Packet loss rate. Numerical analysis demonstrates that Fishnet-6G outperforms existing approaches across these metrics, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of 6G-IoT networks.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (456KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, this paradigm shift also entails novel challenges and prospects for streamlining processes, augmenting efficiency, and ultimately driving success across production workflows and logistical operations. Dynamic supply chains necessitate unimpeded access to high-quality, dependable data to facilitate real-time, data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, owing to their inherently intricate nature, these supply chains are subject to a heightened vulnerability to disruptions and delays, surpassing those encountered in traditional supply chains. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a framework that synthesises the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and blockchain technology (BCT) into a cohesive and integrated system, thereby optimising the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management operations. The proposed framework takes cognisance of the challenges inherent in ensuring information traceability, mitigating fragmented information, enhancing interoperability, and fortifying reliability throughout the design, production, and implementation phases of assets within dynamic supply chains operating in the offsite manufacturing domain. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposition, we present a framework that exemplifies the seamless integration of a permissioned, open-source distributed ledger, which forms the bedrock of our support infrastructure for IoT and BIM integration.\nThrough rigorous analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of the developed framework in the form of a designed Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM-PDO), which harmonises the physical, digital, and operational layers within a robust system architecture (BCT.IoT-BIM). The integration of these technologies provides a decentralised solution, reinforcing supply chains with improved security, reliability, and quality control mechanisms, thus enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain network. It is anticipated that this transformative integration will yield substantial improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operational efficiency, cost reduction, and the cultivation of trust and accountability across supply chain activities.\nThe research proposes an IoT and BIM conceptual framework that simulates the dynamic supply chain operations, facilitating real-time analysis and prediction of supply chain participants' behaviours from resources, processes, and assets. Furthermore, the integration of IoT-BIM (digital twinning) with a blockchain-based system, such as Hyperledger Fabric, engenders a secure and transparent framework for the diligent tracking of assets and information throughout the supply chain. The findings of this study offer an all-encompassing conceptual framework for the secure and transparent tracking of asset information by integrating Blockchain-based technologies with IoT and BIM. This research endeavour thus expands the existing body of knowledge, establishing a foundation for future investigations within this proliferating field.",

The protocol's effectiveness depends on its Objective Function (OF), which orchestrates route selection based on predefined criteria. However, traditional OFs often struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of IoT environments. This paper presents the Adaptive Objective Function (AOF), an innovative algorithm designed to dynamically adjust the OF in real-time, responding to fluctuating network conditions and application requirements. AOF comprises: a Network Monitor, an OF Selector, an OF Switcher, and an Event Handler, all working in concert to enhance network performance, reliability, and energy efficiency. Through simulations, AOF has demonstrated superior performance over legacy OFs, achieving a 10 %â20 % reduction in End-to-End Delay (EED), a 1 %â2 % increase in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), a 10 %â20 % improvement in Network Lifetime (NLT), and a substantial 50 %â80 % decrease in Control Overhead (COH). The paper also presents a smart agriculture case study that illustrates AOF's practical application in optimizing sensor network data routingâa testament to its versatility and practicality. Future endeavours will concentrate on further refining AOF and broadening its application across various IoT domains.",

However, the sensitive data exchanged through IoMT is vulnerable to security attacks, raising serious privacy concerns. Traditional key sharing mechanisms are susceptible to compromise, posing risks to data integrity. This paper proposes a Timestamp-based Secret Key Generation (T-SKG) scheme for resource-constrained devices, generating a secret key at the patient's device and regenerating it at the doctor's device, thus eliminating direct key sharing and minimizing key compromise risks. Simulation results using MATLAB and Java demonstrate the T-SKG scheme's resilience against guessing, birthday, and brute force attacks. Specifically, there is only a 9 % chance of key compromise in a guessing attack if the attacker knows the key sequence pattern, while the scheme remains secure against brute force and birthday attacks within a specified timeframe. The T-SKG scheme is integrated into a healthcare framework to securely transmit health vitals collected using the MySignals sensor kit. For confidentiality, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) with various Cipher Block modes (ECB, CBC, CTR) is employed.",

The broker (Orion, Scorpio and Stellio) and additional components, named Generic Enablers (GE), provide means for collecting IoT data and feeding a data layer. The NGSI standard has a structural role in terms of interoperability, thus promoting the development of new GEs. However, this standard is not being adopted in analytic tools. In general, these tools connect to the IoT backend databases, which poses problems regarding data access control management and requires specialised IT support. Thus, it is not well suited for enterprise scenarios like, for instance, smart agriculture or smart industry, in which self-service tools, such as Power BI, Tableau and Qlik, are frequently used.\nWe propose a lightweight connector for data analytic tools and IoT ecosystems based on NGSI-v2/NGSI-LD/NGSI-TSDB. The proposed system provides web services based on JSON and CSV formats that those tools use without applying complex transformations in the data. Thus, non-technical business users can consume IoT data on demand and use all the analytical capabilities of these tools. We tested the system in an educational scenario where dashboards and analytics processes were developed with minimal effort. The system has implemented a mechanism for access control management at the service/tenant level and several querying features. The system is now being implemented in a real public service scenario. In future versions, we intend to improve the system in terms of performance, security and add more query features.",

The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is crucial for efficient data transmission in IoT networks, but its performance can be significantly degraded by attacks such as Rank, Sinkhole and Wormhole attacks. These threats disrupt network integrity by manipulating routing information, attracting traffic through malicious nodes and tunneling data to malicious endpoints. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework to enhance RPL's security and QoS. Our approach integrates a random forest model for precise traffic classification, a reinforcement learning module for dynamic and adaptive routing, and a modified RPL objective function that incorporates classification outcomes into routing decisions. Simulations demonstrate that our framework significantly improves network throughput, reduces latency, and enhances packet delivery ratios while maintaining low jitter. Furthermore, it achieves a high detection rate, minimal false positives, and swift response to security incidents, thereby robustly securing the RPL protocol and enhancing QoS in IoT-enabled wireless sensor networks. The findings of this research offer substantial contributions to the field, providing a comprehensive solution to strengthen RPL against prevalent security threats.",

The purpose of our work is to propose and evaluate lightweight security measures to safeguard critical infrastructure resources. The scope of our effort involves simulating a secure SCADA/IoT-based hardware test bench for ICSs, utilizing Modbus and MQTT communication protocols. Through case studies in remote servo motor control, water distribution systems, and power system voltage level indicators, vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service (DoS) and Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks are identified, and security recommendations are provided. To execute our work, we deploy lightweight ciphers such as Prime Counter & Hash Chaining (PCHC) and Ascon algorithm with Compression Rate (ACR) for secure information exchange between the plant floor and the control center. Evaluation of these ciphers on Raspberry Pi focuses on execution speed and memory utilization. Additionally, a comparison with the AGA-12 protocol standard for SCADA networks is conducted to underscore the efficacy of the proposed security measures. Our findings include the identification of SCADA network vulnerabilities and the proposal of lightweight security measures to mitigate risks. Performance evaluation of the proposed ciphers on Raspberry Pi demonstrates their effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of deploying such measures to ensure resilience against cyber threats in SCADA environments.",

This system utilizes forecast data from the WRF model, local observations from an custom IoT sensor, and a customized fishpond temperature model.\nâ¢\nThe RMSE of the predicted water temperature difference did not exceed 2 Â°C for up to 72 h of lead time when compared with the observations.\nâ¢\nThe accuracy of predictions was significantly improved by using observed water temperature and water depth from local sensors as system inputs.\nâ¢\nTo account for forecasting uncertainty, an ensemble concept of temperature modeling was adopted.\nAbstract\nThe cold weather-related economic losses in the aquaculture and fisheries industries are enormous and will only increase due to future climate change. Advancements in weather forecasting have increased the accuracy of predicting environmental factors like air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. However, the water temperature of fishponds, which affects the lives of fish, cannot be accurately predicted. As a result, fishermen are unable to implement early disaster mitigation and avoidance measures effectively. In this study, we developed an early warning system for extreme temperature events in fishponds by using a weather forecasting model in combination with local observations from a customized sensor placed in a pond. This system could provide water temperature forecasts with up to 120 h of lead time. A fishpond and multiple events were selected to assess the performance. Compared to the actual observations, the predicted water temperature difference had a root mean square error of <2 Â°C for up to 72 h of lead time. Furthermore, due to limited computational resources for weather forecasting models, the water temperature and depth data collected by the sensor improved the accuracy of temperature prediction specific to each pond. The results have confirmed that the integrated method can effectively predict the water temperature of farmed fishponds and assist fishermen in implementing precautionary measures in time.",

Proactive edge caching is a potential solution for meeting latency constraints in C2T environments, enabling efficient data processing and storage while reducing redundant computation and cost. However, while 5G/6G infrastructural aspects and caching strategies are extensively studied, no frameworks facilitate the design and deployment of caching strategies or address IoTâs unique requirements. This paper proposes CACHE-IT, a proactive edge caching framework that decouples the caching strategy algorithm from the underlying architecture, enabling customization based on application-specific requirements. Through extensive simulations, we analyzed the impact of different configurations on system metrics and verified that the CACHE-IT positively impacts the system latency and hit rate. By implementing a scenario-specific caching strategy, we illustrate the CACHE-IT deployment in a real-world Structure Health Monitoring (SHM) system. The evaluation demonstrates that CACHE-IT impacts positively in terms of latency, hit rate, and the number of requests sent to data providers.",

The majority of farmers in developing countries still rely on the traditional approach to mushroom cultivation. So, modern technology needs to be adopted to enhance productivity to meet local demand. In addition, farmers face complex supply chain problems, a lack of direct communication with agronomists, and frequent outbreaks of diseases. This paper presents a low-cost centralized IoT ecosystem for addressing the aforementioned issues. The ecosystem provides real-time monitoring and automation of mushroom farmhouses, agro-eCommerce for convenient trade, agronomist advisory support, and disease detection with recommendations for early disease diagnosis and remedy. A small farmhouse with two rooms was built to validate the system's performance. The favorable climatic condition was maintained for oyster mushroom cultivation in the controlled room, whereas the traditional method was followed in the ordinary room. The mushroom was cultivated for three consecutive seasons throughout the year in both rooms. We found that the total production in the controlled room exceeded the yield in the ordinary room by around 49%, provided the same batch of seeds was used in both cases. The disease detection model achieved an accuracy of 98.33%, where farmers can upload the suspected image to the IoT ecosystem and get the predicted disease with relevant suggestions. By utilizing this IoT ecosystem can assist farmers in maintaining the required climatic conditions, streamline the problem of intermediaries while facilitating information exchange with agronomists, and aid in early disease detection and remedy recommendations.\nGraphical abstract\nOverall conceptual architecture.\nDownload: Download high-res image (351KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the growing popularity of fitness, the demand for real-time action recognition and feedback is increasing. Current research faces challenges in handling complex actions, real-time processing, and system integration. To address these issues, we propose a novel fitness action recognition model that integrates ResNet, Transformer, and transfer learning techniques. Specifically, ResNet is used for image feature extraction, Transformer handles time-series data processing, and transfer learning accelerates the modelâs adaptation to new data. We evaluated our model on the NTU RGB+D action recognition dataset, achieving 48.5 ms latency, 29.1 fps throughput, and 93.7% accuracy, significantly outperforming other models. Our model achieved an accuracy improvement of 5% over existing methods, demonstrating significant potential for real-time fitness monitoring. By incorporating IoT technology, our system enables real-time data processing and action recognition, making it ideal for smart fitness monitoring. Although the model has high complexity and memory usage, its efficiency and accuracy demonstrate its potential for widespread adoption. Future work will focus on optimizing the model structure and training methods to enhance applicability in resource-constrained environments, ensuring broader usability and efficiency in various real-world applications.",

Concurrently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the Fourth Industrial Revolution by enabling interconnected devices to offer innovative services, ultimately enhancing human lives. This paper presents a new approach utilizing lightweight blockchain technology, effectively reducing the computational burden typically associated with conventional blockchain systems. By integrating this lightweight blockchain with IoT systems, substantial reductions in implementation time and computational complexity can be achieved. Moreover, the paper proposes the utilization of the Okamoto Uchiyama encryption algorithm, renowned for its homomorphic characteristics, to reinforce the privacy and security of IoT-generated data. The integration of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology establishes a secure and decentralized platform for storing and analyzing sensitive data of the supply chain data. This platform facilitates the development of some business models and empowers decentralized applications to perform computations on encrypted data while maintaining data privacy. The results validate the robust security of the proposed system, comparable to standard blockchain implementations, leveraging the distinctive homomorphic attributes of the Okamoto Uchiyama algorithm and the lightweight blockchain paradigm.",

The findings demonstrate that the integration of GP with designed fitness function enables the dynamic learning and adaptation of control strategies, optimizing system behavior based on historical data. The experimental model showcases an ability to efficiently use historical datasets to derive optimal control strategies, with the fitness metric indicating consistent improvement throughout the learning phase.

This paper proposes a smart home system based on ensemble learning of random forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for programmed decision-making tasks, such as categorizing gadgets as âOFFâ or âONâ based on their normal routine in homes. We have integrated emerging blockchain technology to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy authentication and recognition of IoT devices. Our system consists of a 5V relay circuit, various sensors, and a Raspberry Pi server and database for managing devices. We have also developed an Android app that communicates with the server interface through an HTTP web interface and an Apache server. The feasibility and efficacy of the proposed smart home automation system have been evaluated in both laboratory and real-time settings. It is essential to use inexpensive, scalable, and readily available components and technologies in smart home automation systems. Additionally, we must incorporate a comprehensive security and privacy-centric design that emphasizes risk assessments, such as cyberattacks, hardware security, and other cyber threats. The trial results support the proposed system and demonstrate its potential for use in everyday life.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nEvaluation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) integration in urban environments.\nâ¢\nInvestigating the efficiency of real-time monitoring in waste management.\nâ¢\nDevelopment of a predictive model aimed at optimizing waste collection routes.\nâ¢\nIntroduction of a multiagent simulation framework to analyze IoT benefits.\nâ¢\nComparison of IoT sensor-based versus traditional waste collection approaches.\nAbstract\nEffective waste management arises as a crucial challenge for smart city development in the current era of rapid urbanization, shifting towards sustainability and public health. Harnessing modern technologies, especially the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with intelligent waste bins, can revolutionize urban waste collection, optimizing efficiency and reducing costs. This paper delves into a multiagent simulation-based framework for understanding and assessing the dynamics of an IoT-enabled smart waste management system. Initiating with the intricate process of garbage generation, we shift our focus to the real-time monitoring capabilities of IoT-connected waste bins. The study further explores protocols to regulate bin status, along with timing mechanisms to trigger garbage collection rounds. Subsequently, a predictive routing system is introduced to determine the most efficient garbage collection routes. For the binsâ filled level tracking, the ultrasonic sensors are commonly used that send out sound waves and track their echo return time, whereas weight sensors measure the garbage load in the bin, providing insights into waste production trends. For data transmission from bins to the central system, various communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and long-distance networks are considered. Through a simulation, we contrast the innovative IoT-enabled sensor-based collection mechanism against the conventional periodic review strategy. Field experiments at the Al Rayyan locale, proximate to Doha, Qatar, facilitate the model demonstration. By leveraging region-specific data, we simulated various aspects including economic factors, environmental impact, public satisfaction, and operational efficiencies. The findings indicate that with an average daily garbage generation of 1.3 kg per individual, the sensor-driven mechanism remarkably outperforms the periodic review approach by covering fewer distances with fewer trucks, while concurrently achieving the key objectives of cost-efficiency, environmental preservation, public satisfaction, and reduced employee workload. This research contributes to the developing field of smart city technology by providing critical insights for urban planners, policymakers, and technologists attempting to build more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (234KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Addressing the challenges of passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) indoor localization technology in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) and multipath environments, this paper presents an innovative approach by introducing a combined technology integrating an improved Kalman Filter with Space Domain Phase Difference of Arrival (SD-PDOA) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This methodology utilizes the distinct channel characteristics in multipath and NLoS contexts to effectively filter out interference and accurately extract localization information, thereby facilitating high precision and stability in passive RFID localization. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through detailed simulations and empirical tests conducted on a custom-built experimental platform consisting of passive RFID tags and an R420 reader. The findings are significant: in NLoS conditions, the four-antenna localization system achieved a notable localization accuracy of 0.25 m at a distance of 5 m. In complex multipath environments, this system achieved a localization accuracy of approximately 0.5 m at a distance of 5 m. When compared to conventional passive localization methods, our proposed solution exhibits a substantial improvement in indoor localization accuracy under NLoS and multipath conditions. This research provides a robust and effective technical solution for high-precision passive indoor localization in the Internet of Things (IoT) system, marking a significant advancement in the field.",

The intention of this work is to design wireless monitoring wearables, based on widely available textiles and low environmental impact production technologies. Herein we have developed a polymeric ink which is able to functionalize different types of textile fibers (including silver conducting fibers, cotton, and commercial textile) with polypyrrole. These fibers were weaved together with a thinner silver conducting fiber and carbon fiber to form a touch-sensitive energy harvesting system that would generate an electric output when mechanical pressure is applied to it. Different prototypes were manufactured with loom weaving accessories to simulate real textile cloths. By simple touch, the prototypes produced a maximum voltage of 244 V and a maximum power density of 2.29 W mâ2. The current generated is then transformed into a digital signal, which is further utilized for human motion or gesture monitorization. The system comprises a wireless block for the Internet of Things (IoT) applicability that will be eventually extended to future remote health and sports monitoring systems.\nGraphical abstract\nTextile fibers were functionalized with PPy, for the manufacturing of conformable cloth wearables, using conventional textile manufacturing systems.

However this reliance often leads to the inadvertent exposure of private data from smart edge devices. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that protects user privacy by performing collaborative training without uploading private data. Nevertheless, applying classical FL to cognitive IoT systems to preserve privacy preservation faces significant challenges, such as central server failure and communication burden. Furthermore, when edge devices with heterogeneous data and systems participate in federated training, the learning process becomes slow and the performance of edge devices is compromised. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralised FL framework for cognitive IoT, termed DFLâMKF. In DFLâ MKF, the centralised server is eliminated and each edge device is dynamically connected. We initialised models for edge devices based on computational and storage capabilities to accommodate system heterogeneity. Edge devices learned from the knowledge of multiple neighbours via knowledge transfer, and knowledge fusion was employed to aggregate the knowledge of multiple neighbours, thereby improving the performance of local models, and addressing data heterogeneity. Comprehensive experiments were performed on three image classification tasks. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieved superior performance compared to various baselines and improved communication efficiency.",

This research presents a novel Internet of Things (IoT)-driven crop management system, NeuroRF FarmSense, specifically designed for precision agriculture. By utilizing soil sensors and a robust IoT framework, this system enables effective data collection across vast and remote agricultural areas. The study utilizes an extensive Crop Recommendation Dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes 2,200 entries and seven critical attributes essential for crop selection: phosphorus, humidity, potassium, temperature, nitrogen, pH, and rainfall. This dataset provides a detailed methodology for crop recommendations, revealing more than 22 alternative crops based on varying characteristics. For agricultural forecasting, the NeuroRF FarmSense system employs the NeuroRF Classifier, which integrates neural networks (NN) with the Random Forest Classifier, achieving an unprecedented accuracy of 99.82%, exceeding prior records. This integrative approach harnesses the advantages of NNâs ReLU activation and dropout regularization alongside the robustness of RF. By utilizing NN predictions as input features for RF training and refining RF through grid search with cross-validation, the ensemble model produces highly precise predictions, facilitating strategic crop cultivation for optimal yields across diverse environmental conditions. This innovative methodology signifies a strong solution for classification challenges in precision agriculture. By merging IoT technology with machine learning algorithms, smart farming is poised to enter a transformative phase, providing a scalable response to the pressing issues of global food security. This research aspires to advance precision agriculture in harmony with global sustainability objectives.",

        "abstract": "Indonesia is a producer in the fisheries sector, with production reaching 14.8 million tons in 2022. The production potential of the fisheries sector can be optimally optimized through aquaculture management. One of the most important issues in aquaculture management is how to efficiently control the fish pond water conditions. IoT technology can be applied to support a fish pond aquaculture monitoring system, especially for catfish species (Siluriformes), in real-time and remotely. One of the technologies that can provide this convenience is the IoT. The problem of this study is how to integrate IoT devices with Firebaseâs cloud data system to provide reliable and precise data, which makes it easy for fish cultivators to monitor fishpond conditions in real time and remotely. The IoT aquaculture fishpond monitoring use 3 parameters: (1) water temperature; (2) pH water level; and (3) turbidity level of pond water. IoT devices use temperature sensors, pH sensors, and turbidity sensors, which are integrated with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi module. Data from sensor readings are sent to the Firebase cloud via the Wi-Fi module so that it can be accessed in real time by end users with an Android-based mobile app. The findings are (1) the IoT-based aquaculture monitoring system device has a low error rate in measuring temprature, pH, and turbidity with a percentage of 1.75%, 1.94% and 9.78%, respectively. Overall, the total average error of the three components is 4.49%; (2) in cost analysis, IoT-based has a cost-effectiveness of 94.21% compared to labor costs. An IoT-based aquaculture monitoring system using Firebase can be effectively used as a technology for monitoring fish pond conditions in real-time and remotely for fish cultivators that contribute to providing an IoT-based aquaculture monitoring system that produces valid data, is precise, is easy to implement, and is a low-cost system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced significant growth in recent years and has emerged as a very dynamic sector in the worldwide market. Being an open-source platform with a substantial user base, Android has not only been a driving force in the swift advancement of the IoT but has also garnered attention from malicious actors, leading to malware attacks. Given the rapid proliferation of Android malware in recent times, there is an urgent requirement to introduce practical techniques for the detection of such malware. While current machine learning-based Android malware detection approaches have shown promising results, the majority of these methods demand extensive time and effort from malware analysts to construct dynamic or static features. Consequently, the practical application of these methods becomes challenging. Therefore, this paper presents an Android malware detection system characterized by its lightweight design and reliance on explainable machine-learning techniques. The system uses features extracted from mobile applications (apps) to distinguish between malicious and benign apps. Through extensive testing, it has exhibited exceptional accuracy and an F1-score surpassing 0.99 while utilizing minimal device resources and presenting negligible false positive and false negative rates. Furthermore, the classifier model's transparency and comprehensibility are significantly augmented through the application of Shapley's additive explanation scores, enhancing the overall interpretability of the system.\nGraphical abstract\nThe rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the need for practical techniques to detect malware.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe growth of IoT (Internet of Things) devices has revolutionized several industries and brought about novel security threats. Recognizing network anomalies that may point to malicious activity or system flaws is a major issue. Traditional anomalous identification methods frequently need to catch up when dealing with the special traits of IoT environments, including resource limitations and changing network behavior. This paper introduces an innovative approach, the Bat-optimized CNN-BiLSTM model, to enhance the security and efficiency of IoT environments. This model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial analysis and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for capturing temporal patterns, thus effectively representing time and space trends in IoT data. To optimize its performance further, researchers have leveraged the Bat algorithm, inspired by natural behaviors, to fine-tune the model. This program effectively searches for the best network anomaly detection parameters by imitating the echo activity of bats. Researchers want to increase detection accuracy by lowering false positives and false negatives using the Bat algorithm to enhance the CNN-BiLSTM model. The experimental findings show that the Bat-optimised CNN-BiLSTM model beats the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods with 99.43% accuracy and efficiency.",

This study explored the impact of the number of fog devices (NFDs) on the performance of IoT-fog-cloud systems. Through comparative analysis, two scheduling algorithmsâFirst Come First Serve (FCFS) and Priorityâwere evaluated across different scales of system deployment. The results indicated that the FCFS algorithm was optimal for systems with fewer NFDs, whereas the Priority algorithm proved advantageous in larger settings. These findings not only establish guidelines for selecting appropriate scheduling strategies based on the scale of fog device deployment but also provide strategic insights for businesses on the optimal distribution of computational resources. This research aids companies in deciding whether to centralize resources in fewer branches with more employees or to decentralize into more branches with fewer employees, thereby optimizing operational efficiency and responsiveness.",

Therefore, a cloud-edge collaborative federated GAN-based communication and computing resource scheduling algorithm with long-term constraint violation sensitiveness is proposed to address these challenges. The proposed algorithm facilitates real-time, energy-efficient data processing by optimizing transmission power control, data migration, and computing resource allocation. It employs federated learning for global parameter aggregation to enhance GAN parameter updating and dynamically adjusts GAN learning rates and global aggregation weights based on energy consumption constraint violations.

However, these devices have storage limitations when dealing with extensive data streams. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage solution, addresses these constraints. However, IPFS's significant time requirement for data recording introduces a new challenge. Furthermore, its Content IDentifiers (CIDs) do not inherently convey the source device's identity or associated metadata, adding complexity to specific condition-based data retrieval. These factors hinder the discernment of the current data state, preventing IoT devices from clearing storage space by deleting unnecessary data. Consequently, this results in inadequate storage capacity for IoT devices, posing an obstacle to collecting and transmitting large data. Our study proposes a hybrid architecture to address these challenges, integrating the decentralized storage capabilities of IPFS with a centralized CID management system. This architecture employs Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for efficient CID transfer and a database for archiving CID values and associated metadata. Using the archived metadata, IoT devices determine the status of the data and perform tasks accordingly. This enables effective storage management for IoT devices by removing data that has already been uploaded and is safe for deletion. Our architecture demonstrates versatility, accommodating data of varying sizes, formats, and frequencies. We validated our approach through an extensive 100-hour experiment, successfully collecting 356 GB of data from diverse sensors. These results underscore the robustness and adaptability of our architecture, emphasizing its potential for a range of IoT applications.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (384KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This paper examines the inherent vulnerabilities of IoT devices, including weak authentication, rare software updates, and susceptibility to malware. These vulnerabilities can expose smart homes to unauthorized access, leading to unauthorized money transfers and identity theft. Additionally, as the IoT ecosystem is interconnected, the risk increases, as a compromised device becomes an entry point for a broader network breach. The lack of standardized security protocols and regulatory frameworks further exacerbates this challenge. Therefore, addressing these risks requires collaboration among manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and users to establish robust security standards. In this way, the security of financial transactions using smart homes can be enhanced, and potential threats can be mitigated.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, quantum computers offer the promise of addressing complex computational issues that traditional cryptographic methods find challenging. The unparalleled computational power of quantum computers makes existing cryptographic schemes, tailored to mitigate computational complexity, ineffective. This research introduces a robust encryption scheme designed specifically for digital data exchanged between IoT devices such as smartphones, smart sensors, and smart health monitoring devices. The proposed encryption framework is based on bit-plane extraction-based encryption, the chaotic sine model, the hyperchaotic map, the quantum baker map, and quantum operations such as quantum selective scrambling. The proposed methodology involves three key phases: the first and last phase related to permutation, which is performed at the bit level based on discrete bit-plane scrambling, bit-plane extraction, and hyperchaotic mapping. However, the second phase is based on diffusion, which depends on the chaotic sine model. During the initial stage, creating correlations among image pixels, along with a couple of chaotic sequences using a quantum baker map, is accomplished through a superposition of quantum-states. Before applying diffusion, the pixels of the grayscale image are encoded using a single qubit, and quantum operations are based on a quantum circuit featuring swap gates. To introduce pixel-level permutation, a hyperchaotic map generates random sequences within the range of 0 to 255. A circular shift further shuffles the pixel rows and pixel columns of the permuted image pixels. To enhance the digital image security further, bit-planes are extracted from the permuted bit-planes. Then, the bits within each bit plane are scrambled using a random sequence generated by the hyperchaotic map. Finally, the encoded bit planes are merged to produce a final encrypted image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, with security parameters such as correlation, entropy, and key space measuring at 0.0001, 7.999, and\n, respectively. Furthermore, to assess performance in relation to computational complexity, a detailed analysis of computational time is conducted. The results reveal that the proposed encryption scheme can execute all encryption steps presented in the proposed method in less than one second. These findings demonstrate the secure transmission of digital data between IoT devices and show the suitability of the proposed encryption scheme for real-time applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nProtecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize synchronizing technology and routine life for sustainability. Food and water shortage, and exponentially increasing environmental pollution are the biggest challenges for sustainability. Livestock plays a vital role in developing countriesâ economies; the most profitable businesses are breeding dairy and non-dairy products. The productivity of cattle farms is dependent on the health conditions of cattle. Identifying unhealthy cattle and providing suitable treatment is critical. Hence, deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) along with AI systems is one of the potential solutions. This cattle health monitoring system provides monitoring of cattle health to ensure the minimum human intervention. A system has been designed and developed to aid the intelligent cattle health monitoring system by using machine learning techniques. The system includes multiple sensor nodes, each having a body area sensor that is connected to the IoT platform through a controller. As a novelty, the prototype has been trained and evaluated using a federated learning technique. The system warns the owner about specific diseases such as fever, mastitis, foot and mouth disease, and ketosis. The presented results validate the proposal as it diagnoses the prescribed viral diseases precisely. We have implemented the Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier for this multiclass problem. Considering the federated learning model, three different datasets are considered as three different clients with 70% train and 30% test data. Client 1, Client 2, and Client 3 represent the cattle farm, veterinary hospital, and veterinary respectively. The sensor nodes are placed on key points of the cattle body while each node collects physiological parameters that are further used to train the prediction system. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly Android application for the owner to control cattle well-being.

Life has changed dramatically for the Internet of Things over the past few years as a result of the development of artificial intelligence and data mining technologies, which offer methods for analyzing both current and past data. In this study, we present an IoT-based medical diagnosis system that can successfully discriminate malignant individuals from positive individuals in an IoT environment to address the challenge of early breast cancer detection. An innovative optimization technique built on the Advanced Al-Biruni Earth Radius (ABER) optimization algorithm improved the classification of breast cancer cases. We suggest semantic picture segmentation of breast cancer histology in this article. The enhanced U-Net architecture for map partitioning is partitioned concurrently. Then, regions of interest are extracted using segmentation, and morphological and texture features are computed. A Convolutional Squared Deviation Neural Network Classifier (CSDNN) classifies tumors into six groups based on specific criteria. Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis (WDBC) dataset, we evaluated the suggested methodology. A series of simulations was run to show the ABER-CSDNN method's superior performance, and the results reveal promising performance when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Accuracy of proposed method achieves 99.12%.",

Additionally, traditional fire detection methods are inadequate and poorly integrated with advanced technologies. It is crucial to develop a more efficient and reliable fire detection system. Also, the lack of real-time and accurate monitoring in current systems compromises the resilience and sustainability of farming operations. This article details developing and implementing a real-time fire detection system tailored for smart agriculture. It integrates cutting-edge technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, and a Flask-based web application, fortified by cybersecurity measures such as login authentication and secure HTTP protocols. The system's primary aim is to monitor environmental conditions continuously in agricultural fields to detect signs of smoke or flame swiftly, facilitating preventive actions to safeguard crops and infrastructure. The architecture employs sensors distributed across fields to monitor conditions, a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the central processing unit for data acquisition and transmission, and a web interface developed using Flask, HTML, and CSS for secure and real-time visualization of detection data. Critical components like the MCP3208 analog-to-digital converter ensure the system's reliability and accuracy. Experimental results confirm the system's efficacy in early fire detection and real-time data visualization via the web browser. Enhanced security features, such as login authentication, protect sensitive information, while regular updates maintain data relevance. This study advances fire prevention and farm preservation efforts, offering a high-performance technological solution for proactive monitoring and quick response to fire risks, thereby supporting food security and sustainable agricultural practices.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (348KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, challenges persist when applying IoT to road infrastructure monitoring, including insufficient durability of front-end sensors, pavement damage due to sensor embedding, and the redundancy of a vast amount of real-time data, hindering the long-term real-time monitoring of pavements. To address these challenges, this study developed a self-powered distributed intelligent pavement monitoring system based on IoT, encompassing a sensor network, cloud platform, communication network, and power supply system. Considering the specific characteristics of slipform paving for cement concrete pavements, an integrated paving process was proposed, merging embedded sensors with pavement material structures. Through on-site engineering monitoring, the system actively collects and analyzes various data types such as system energy consumption, temperature and humidity, environmental noise, wind speed and direction, and pavement structural vibrations, providing data support for pavement design, maintenance, and vehicle-road synergy applications. Future efforts will continue to promote the application of IoT technology in digital road maintenance, traffic safety, and optimized pavement material structure design.",

We address the optimization problem of VNF migration in an NFV-enabled IoT system (NIoT), considering the dynamics of traffic volume processed by an individual IoT function. We develop an optimization model based on integer linear programming and a function traffic-aware heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. The evaluation results show that our proposed heuristic algorithm offers an approximation solution very close to the optimal VNF migration in significantly reduced time. It outperforms a benchmark solution based on Simulated Annealing in both the service restoration cost and computation time. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into an investment strategy for an IoT service provider seeking to enhance the system performance in the presence of a failure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study outlines the development and the implementation phases of an assessment tool designed to evaluate the socioenvironmental effectiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT) in manufacturing companies and their supply chains, considering sustainability (Triple Bottom Line â TBL) and circularity (Circular Economy) principles. The assessment tool covers expectations, engagement, barriers, challenges, IoT characteristics, Performance Measurement and Management (PMM) of the company (meta-evaluation), and IoT practices. The tool is grounded in fundamental premises, including an assessment-driven management approach, integration of organizational theories, integration of sustainability into organizational strategy, incorporation of sustainability into PMM, macro-congruence, micro-congruence, alignment between organizational strategy and PMM, and alignment between technology and PMM. The tool can be used as a comprehensive survey instrument for extensive exploration within the manufacturing sector. However, for in-depth exploration, it is recommended to employ the case study methodology, following the proposed âfour-stage assessment process'. The research methodology adheres to the PRISMA statement and Jabareen's framework. To the best of our knowledge, a dedicated assessment tool for IoT with a specific focus on sustainable manufacturing is currently unavailable. It's important to mention that the assessment tool was developed primarily through a comprehensive literature review without empirical validation. Consequently, there is a pressing need for refinement and validation, providing an avenue for future investigations to seek expert contributions and insights using the Delphi process. Moreover, subsequent studies may also include rigorous statistical tests, such as assessments of validity and reliability, to enhance the tool's robustness and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Traditional farming procedures are time-consuming and expensive as based on manual labor. Farmers have no proper knowledge to select which crop is suitable to grow according to the environmental factors and soil characteristics. This is the main reason for the low yield of crops and the economic crisis in the agricultural sector of the different countries. The use of modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and ensemble learning can facilitate farmers to observe different factors such as soil electrical conductivity (EC), and environmental factors like temperature to improve crop yield. These parameters play a vital role in suggesting a suitable crop to cope the food scarcity. This paper proposes a system comprised of two modules, first module uses static data and the second module takes hybrid data collection (IoT-based real-time data and manual data) with machine learning and ensemble learning algorithms to suggest the suitable crop in the farm to maximize the yield. Python is used to train the model that predicts the crop. This system proposed an intelligent and low-cost solution for the farmers to process the data and predict the suitable crop. We implemented the proposed system in the field. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system are confirmed by the generated results to predict the crop.",

In this paper, we quantify such improvements for a specific logistics chain case. To support the inventory of cost and emission data, we utilize system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (AB) to define the structure of the two logistical systems, simulating and estimating differences in e.g., required storage levels, efficiency of transport, etc. In particular, we assess the difference in carbon emissions, cost, and market performance of a battery delivery chain in the delivery process between a two-tier IoT-supported supply chain (users are served by an IoT retailer directly connected to the producer) and a conventional three-tier supply chain (include an additional wholesaler to connect retailer and producer). The results demonstrate that IoT supply chains have significant advantages in minimizing average product storage and shipment fluctuations. IoT suppliers can estimate market demand to adjust production and transportation strategies for new orders. Consequently, the overall profitability of the IoT supply chain increases by more than 30%. Heating and lighting emissions in the storage process and direct emissions in transportation per functional unit (one unit of a Li-ion cell module) are reduced by 60%â70% under middle- and low-demand scenarios, and by at least 50% under high-demand scenario. However, the increasing use and higher loading rates of heavy trucks will weaken the advantages of IoT. Moreover, IoT products occupies a 10% lower market share compared to conventional ones under the same pricing strategy but achieves similar market share under the same value-added strategy.",

Additionally, CKD is associated with various dietary factors, including liver failure, diabetes, anemia, nerve damage, inflammation, peroxidation, obesity, and other related conditions. Therefore, early prediction of CKD is important to progress the functionality of the kidney. In recent times, IoT has been widely used in a diversity of healthcare sectors through the incorporation of monitoring devices such as digital sensors and medical devices for patient monitoring from remote places. To overcome the problem, this research proposed a conceptual architecture for CKD detection. The sensor layer of the architecture includes IoT devices to collect data and the proposed classifier, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), utilizes the Anova-F feature selection technique to effectively detect CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease). In addition to MLP, four other classifiers including ANN (Artificial Neural Network), Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and SVM (Support Vector Machine), are employed for comparative analysis of accuracy. Furthermore, three additional feature selection techniques, namely Chi-squared, SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection), and SBFS (Sequential Backward Floating Selection), are utilized to evaluate their impact on the accuracy of CKD detection. Our proposed method outperforms all other approaches with a remarkable accuracy of 99 % while maintaining efficient computational time. This advancement is crucial in developing a highly accurate machine capable of predicting CKD in remote areas with ease.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nDemand of electric vehicle charging infrastructure could create range anxiety among users.\nâ¢\nA proposed charging infrastructure â A transformative solution.\nâ¢\nAn integration of renewable energy, scheduling, monitoring, and security.\nâ¢\nInternet-of-things based monitoring of charging slots of a charging station.\nâ¢\nReduced load to grid through optimal power sharing.\nAbstract\nThe widespread adoption of electrical vehicles (EVs) has led to an increased demand for charging stations which required an adequate charging infrastructure. However, this challenge brings substantial financial and ecological implications for the power grid and other major stakeholders such as EV users, system operators and policymakers. To resolve this issue, this work proposes a smart EV charging infrastructure that provides 1) effective load management of EVs, 2) real-time monitoring of charging slots at a charging station, 3) smart security system, and 4) integration of renewable energy resources (RERs) into charging stations. This is achieved by setting out how to incorporate photovoltaic (PV) system into charging station infrastructure while suggesting effective EV load management with optimal energy utilization and minimal energy costs. Also, the annual power production of PV systems and power sharing between different power resources has been investigated to enable effective decisions about EV scheduling. The proposed infrastructure also offers an internet-of-things (IoT)-based monitoring of fast/slow charging units with real-time slot tracking to the users and charging station operators. The security aspect of the charging station is covered by a sensor-driven radio frequency identification (RFID) system. Experimental results that the proposed system generates 1,055,326 kWh/year, reducing grid reliance by 50% (to 335,775 kWh) and lowering CO2 emissions from 425,326 kg to 212,210 kg. Moreover, energy costs drop from $0.30 to $0.13 per kWh and 270,567 kWh/year energy is sold back to the grid. The proposed system yields a net present revenue of $1,020,000 which demonstrates significant economic and environmental benefits.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nEnergy dissipation is the most important design limitation for Internet of Things (IoT) enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In order to prolong the life of WSNs, the energy of nodes must be used in an effective way. Clustering is a strategy that may effectively use the energy of the sensors, extending the life and scalability by managing the network load balance. The energy usage for network operation is reduced by using an evolutionary algorithm called Genetic Algorithm (GA). The Stochastic Cluster Head Selection Model (SCHSM) is described in the proposed protocol by taking the factors such as distance, node energy, density and capacity of nodes for developing the fitness function. The proposed protocol is designed for multiple movable sink nodes and this greatly improves the energy balancing factor in the network. For minimizing the communication gap among sensors and sinks, movable sinks can be placed carefully. Simulation results are analyzed for the system effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper proposes a Distributed Software Architecture (DSA) for Smart Building (SB) based on the Reactive Manifesto (RM) principles. To follow the RM principles, we analyze the usage of different deployment approaches, particularly the impact of using a container orchestrator on the application layer. After running performance tests on the different configurations, the container orchestrator usage led to enhanced distributed processing, lowering the latency, increasing flexibility, enhancing security, and providing cost-effectiveness and scalability. We introduce the implementation of a modern DSA, developed following state-of-the-art cloud patterns and compliant with the RM for the SB context. Furthermore, we have ensured the reproducibility of this implementation by making the initial tests and overall architecture code available in public repositories. The research follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology for elaborating each phase until we get the artifact (DSA) and, with this, contribute to the Knowledge Base. The architecture was properly tested, considering the performance as the principal test layer. This solution is tailored for application in domains of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on the SB and a case study involving the Laboratory of Distributed Systems and Concurrent Programming (LaSDPC) at SÃ£o Paulo University. Moreover, its applicability extends to IoT domains like smart home, smart campus, smart city, and health-related applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper delves into the crucial challenge of safeguarding data sensitivity and preventing security breaches, which can result in substantial losses, including significant financial costs and potential loss of lives. Notably, the United States faces the highest financial burden, with data breaches costing approximately USD 5.09 million. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enormous volumes of data are collected from diverse sources. However, the inherent limitations in computational power and memory of IoT devices render them susceptible targets for malicious attacks. This study focuses on fortifying the security of multimedia data, encompassing audio, video, and images, obtained from IoT devices. Cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and quantum cryptography are explored as promising avenues to bolster multimedia security and preserve privacy. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) emerges as an alternative to classical encryption and key distribution methods, offering heightened data security. Simultaneously, blockchain leverages hash functions to augment the overall security posture. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD facilitates secure key exchange between involved parties for data encryption and decryption. Additionally, the paper introduces innovative methodologies to enhance the security, privacy, and anonymity of IoT devices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a global network that connects a large number of smart devices. MQTT is a de facto standard, lightweight, and reliable protocol for machine-to-machine communication, widely adopted in IoT networks. Various smart devices within these networks are employed to handle sensitive information. However, the scale and openness of IoT networks make them highly vulnerable to security breaches and attacks, such as eavesdropping, weak authentication, and malicious payloads. Hence, there is a need for advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing ML-based IoT-IDSs face several limitations in effectively detecting malicious activities, mainly due to imbalanced training data. To address this, this study introduces a transformer neural network-based intrusion detection system (TNN-IDS) specifically designed for MQTT-enabled IoT networks. The proposed approach aims to enhance the detection of malicious activities within these networks. The TNN-IDS leverages the parallel processing capability of the Transformer Neural Network, which accelerates the learning process and results in improved detection of malicious attacks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, it was compared with various IDSs based on ML and DL approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TNN-IDS outperforms other systems in terms of detecting malicious activity. The TNN-IDS achieved optimum accuracies reaching 99.9% in detecting malicious activities.",

In comparison to the conventional grid, the smart grid (SG) uses many cutting-edge technologies. This research introduces a fog computing encryption-based model for privacy preservation in the smart grid model. By using different advanced technologies, our model addresses the balance between privacy, security, effectiveness and functionality. The model facilitates efficient communication and function inquiry while mitigating challenges posed by massive Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the smart grid environment. Specifically, it tackles the secure data consolidation challenge by employing encryption-based techniques for transmitting private data from smart meters to fog devices. These devices consolidate the data before updating to cloud. Conventional data consolidation approaches for SGs have high computation and communication costs and suffer from high storage requirement. The proposed model resolves these issues; algorithms for data consolidation and extraction of data at fog device and cloud respectively to obtain the secure communication has also been included. The performance of the developed mechanism has been computed against existing data consolidation mechanisms GCEDA (Grouping of Clusters for Efficient Data Aggregation), SPPDA (Secure Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation) and LPDA (Lightweight Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation) for numerous performance parameters. And the results proves that the performance of developed mechanism with respect to bytes of storage, communication cost and ratio of transmission is better than the existing ones.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (246KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

As a result, businesses have become more aware of the impact of their activities on the environment, including the production of digital technologies. Sustainability has become a significant concern for businesses worldwide, pushing them to explore ways to integrate sustainable practices into their operations and address this issue. Digitization has emerged as an essential tool, with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology leading the way. Organizations can improve decision-making and enhance operational efficiency with IoT, but aligning its implementation with the United Nationsâ Sustainable Development Goals is essential. Concepts like Industry 4.0 and Circular Economy principles have emerged to create sustainable business models, but their implementation faces various challenges. Businesses must adopt analytical methods and tools to support strategic planning. This study applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method to identify twelve key challenges businesses face in this IoT adoption. A survey was used for gathering expert opinion from industry specialists working in the field of IoT for conducting advanced analytical techniques like Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (F-ISM) and Matrice dâImpacts CroisÃ©s Multiplication AppliquÃ©s Ã  un Classement (MICMAC) to highlight the most critical challenges, including loss of value appropriation, Low incentive to change, Less adoption of sustainable practices and Lack of interoperability. While IoT holds great promise for supporting sustainable development, the result highlights the urgent need for stakeholder collaboration to overcome these challenges and unlock its full potential. The findings of this study benefit organizations heavily dependent on digital services like IoT by providing them with a comprehensive framework for effectively implementing IoT towards sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to a significant increase in the computational task load of Terminal Devices (TDs). TDs reduce response latency and energy consumption with the support of task-offloading in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). However, existing task-offloading optimization methods typically assume that MECâs computing resources are unlimited, and there is a lack of research on the optimization of task-offloading when MEC resources are exhausted. In addition, existing solutions only decide whether to accept the offloaded task request based on the single decision result of the current time slot, but lack support for multiple retry in subsequent time slots. It is resulting in TD missing potential offloading opportunities in the future. To fill this gap, we propose a Two-Stage Offloading Decision-making Framework (TSODF) with request holding and dynamic eviction. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based task-offloading request prediction and MEC resource release estimation are integrated to infer the probability of a request being accepted in the subsequent time slot.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe high-speed data routing in the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is vital in improving network performance. Existing routing protocols face difficulties dealing with frequent node relocations, energy efficiency optimization, scalability, and dynamic network environments. The inadequacy of conventional routing algorithms in handling the issues provided by frequent node relocations, energy efficiency optimization, scalability, and dynamic network settings in IoT-enabled WSNs is identified as the problem. Traditional protocols are inflexible in the face of node relocations, whereas machine learning-based techniques frequently miss energy efficiency factors. Reinforcement learning-based techniques presume static topologies and the potential of federated learning in WSN routing is largely untapped. The goal is to provide adaptive and energy-efficient routing while considering message overhead, temporal complexity, data sum rate, communication delay, and scalability. The research adopts federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) to address these limitations for routing the high-speed data packets in IoT-enabled WSNs. The proposed research technique uses FDRL, which enables distributed decision-making and adaptive routing in dynamic network situations. The fundamental instant data load is separated into cluster pairs in the proposed technique, each with one strong and one weak sensor node. This split enables optimal network load balancing and resource use. The FDRL architecture is used to disperse the learning process across numerous nodes or access points, allowing for localized decision-making while taking advantage of global coordination. The simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the FDRL Routing in terms of packet loss, latency, energy efficiency, and scalability. The results show that the proposed federated DRL-based intelligent data routing approach outperforms traditional protocols and other current routing strategies.",

Researchers have proposed numerous intrusion detection techniques to mitigate the harm caused by these threats. Enterprises use intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) to keep their networks safe, stable, and accessible. Network intrusion detection solutions have lately integrated powerful Machine Learning (ML) techniques to safeguard IoT networks. Selecting the proper data features for effectively training such ML models is critical to maximizing detection accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the efficiency of these systems degrades in high-dimensional data spaces, and it is crucial to have a suitable feature extraction method to eliminate extraneous data from the classification procedure. The detection accuracy and false positive rate of many ML-based IDSs also rise when the samples used to train the models are unbalanced. This study provides a detailed overview of the UNSW-NB15(DS-1) and NF-UNSWNB15(DS-2) datasets for intrusion detection, which will be utilized to develop and evaluate our models. In addition, this model uses the MaxAbsScaler algorithm to implement a filter-based feature scaling strategy . Then, use the condensed feature set to perform several ML techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), considering multiclass classification. Accuracy tests for the multiclass classification scheme were improved from 60% to 94% using the MaxAbsScaler-based feature scaling method.",

Developed WIPT is tailored to facilitate numerous Internet of Things (IoT) sensors operating at the low-power regime. Generally, WIPT is accomplished with a system possessing two operating bands. Therefore, the dual-band system working at frequencies of 405 MHz and 900 MHz was proposed. WIPT is achieved by coupling two defected ground structure-based resonators that are designed by cascading two single-band resonating structures. Then, MTM with the double negative characteristics at WIPT's operating frequencies was incorporated, which led to the performance enhancement. The power transfer efficiency of WIPT was increased by 14% and 7% at 405 MHz and 900 MHz, respectively, when the resonators were coupled at 20 mm. It is worth mentioning that WIPT and MTM share the same area of 25 Ã 25 mm2 to keep the compactness of the overall system. The WIPT system was evaluated in terms of charging time for two low-power IoT sensors. The powering time was approximated considering two scenarios: using only one band and two bands simultaneously. The provided analysis in both cases reveals that MTM-integrated WIPT aids in the significant reduction of a charging cycle.",

Today, IoT nodes are a treasure house of data and hence security has become a major concern in IoT networks. Conventional cryptography faces many challenges during implementation in IoT devices. These challenges can be tackled by lightweight cryptography which is highly secure with less resource requirements. The vital characteristic of security is fulfilled by one out of 6 inner structures such as Substitution-Permutation Network, Feistel Network, General Feistel Network, Add-Rotate-XOR, Non Linear-Feedback Shift Register and Hybrid. PRESENT, which is a NIST approved lightweight cryptographic algorithm with SPN structure uses fixed or static S-Box. This permits attackers to explore S-Box and identify weaknesses of the algorithm. Key dependent approaches are better because it impedes an attacker from any offline analyses of attacks on the S-Box. Additionally, this is susceptible to linear and differential attacks. The static S Box does not possess superior diffusion and does not have a good rate of avalanche effect. So, the solution is to create a robust dynamic key dependent algorithm with nonlinear S-Boxes to secure the communication between IoT devices and platform. Security analysis is done on Non-linearity, Differential and Linear Cryptanalysis and Avalanche characteristics, besides, encryption of IoT data to demonstrate its aptness for cold chain security applications.\nÂ© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe 5th industrial revolution is characterized by an extensive interconnection of embedded devices, which offer a range of services, including the monitoring of their environments. Images captured from remote cameras require enhancements for effective analysis. Despite recent progress in single-image super-resolution techniques by yielding impressive results through deep convolutional neural networks, the complexity of these advanced models renders them impractical for use on miniaturized Internet of Things (IoT) devices, primarily due to their limited computational capabilities and memory constraints. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of IoT devices necessitates efficient image super-resolution techniques, while existing advanced methods, based on deep convolutional neural networks, are too resource-intensive for these devices, and this gap highlights the need for a more suitable solution. In this study, we introduce a lightweight, efficient super-resolution model specifically designed for IoT devices. This model incorporates a novel deep residual feature distillation block (DRFDB), which leverages a depthwise-separable convolution block (DCB) for effective feature extraction. The focus is on reducing computational and memory demands without compromising on image quality. The proposed DCB extracts coarse features from given input features as calculation units, using two operations, depthwise and pointwise convolutions. These two operations are able to significantly reduce the number of parameters and floating-point operations while maintaining a PSNR value higher than the 90% threshold. We modify the proposed DCB and introduce a multi-kernel depthwise-separable convolution block (MKDCB) to fine-tune the model. The experiments, conduct on various standard datasets such as DIV2K, Set5, Set14, Urban100, and Manga109 by demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both image quality and computational efficiency. The model shows improved performance metrics like PSNR, while requiring fewer parameters and less memory usage, making it highly suitable for IoT applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntegrating Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in art design has created new possibilities for artists to create immersive and interactive experiences. However, data collection, analysis, and utilization in IoT art installations raise significant security and privacy concerns. Additionally, incorporating differential privacy techniques in IoT art installations poses optimization challenges. This paper explores optimizing differential privacy budgets based on deep learning in IoT art installations. By leveraging deep learning models, privacy budgets can be dynamically allocated to preserve individual privacy while maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the artwork. In light of this, a deep learning-based differential privacy budget optimization strategy for IoT art installations is suggested. This method adaptively distributes various budgets by the iterative change law of parameters. A regularization term is provided to limit the disturbance term to avoid the issue of excessive noise. This stops the neural network from overfitting and also assists in learning the model's salient characteristics. The capacity of the model to generalize is effectively improved by the suggested strategy, according to experiments. The accuracy difference between the model trained with noise and the model trained with original data is less than 0.5% as the number of iterations increases. Therefore, the proposed method can protect the user's privacy, effectively ensure the model's availability, and achieve the balance between privacy and availability. This accuracy ensures that the installation functions as intended and delivers the desired aesthetic impact, enabling artists to convey their artistic message effectively.",

        "abstract": "With the increase in IoT (Internet of Things) devices comes an inherent challenge of security. In the world today, privacy is the prime concern of every individual. Preserving oneâs privacy and keeping anonymity throughout the system is a desired functionality that does not come without inevitable trade-offs like scalability and increased complexity and is always exceedingly difficult to manage. The challenge is keeping confidentiality and continuing to make the person innominate throughout the system. To address this, we present our proposed architecture where we manage IoT devices using blockchain technology. Our proposed architecture works on and off blockchain integrated with the closed-circuit television (CCTV) security camera fixed at the rental property. In this framework, the CCTV security camera feed is redirected towards the owner and renter based on the smart contract conditions. One entity (owner or renter) can see the CCTV security camera feed at one time. There is no third-party dependence except for the CCTV security camera deployment phase. Our contributions include the proposition of framework architecture, a novel smart contract algorithm, and the modification to the ring signatures leveraging an existing cryptographic technique. Analyses are made based on different systemsâ security and key management areas. In an empirical study, our proposed algorithm performed better in key generation, proof generation, and verification times. By comparing similar existing schemes, we have shown the proposed architecturesâ advantages. Until now, we have developed this system for a specific area in the real world. However, this system is scalable and applicable to other areas like healthcare monitoring systems, which is part of our future work.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has brought a new era of interconnected devices and seamless data exchange. As the IoT ecosystem continues to expand, there is an increasing need for effective identity management mechanisms, specifically for authorization processes and access control. The pervasiveness of such devices demands that desirable solutions tackle not only security properties but also privacy aspects like granular control over which identity data is shared in authentication/authorization processes, covering aspects like bootstrapping, enrolment, and service provision. In this context, it is natural to turn to privacy-enhancing technologies, like (privacy-preserving) Attribute-Based Credentials (p-ABC), for achieving both high security and privacy guarantees. Nonetheless, these technical tools need to be accompanied by a comprehensive approach that deals with the particularities of IoT scenarios and covers the full lifetime of the device. In this work, we propose the use of a p-ABC scheme with support for distributed issuance (dp-ABC) as a keystone for privacy-preserving attribute-based authentication and authorization in IoT scenarios. We integrate said cryptographic scheme with W3Câs Verifiable Credentials standard, evaluating its impact to gauge its feasibility. The integration facilitates adoption and, particularly, allows the solution to transparently coexist with simpler techniques in heterogeneous scenarios that demand them. Moreover, we define and analyse a generic and comprehensive framework for identity management that identifies challenges throughout the deviceâs lifetime to achieve IoT privacy-preserving identity management following self-sovereign principles. We show how the various aspects identified in the framework are tackled in a concrete instantiation as part of the H2020 project ERATOSTHENES.",

This necessitates the use of efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to mitigate cyber threats. Deep learning (DL) techniques provides a promising approach to effectively detect irregularities in network traffic, enhancing IoT network security and reducing cyber threats. In this paper, DL-based IDS is proposed using Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Neural Networks (RandNN) to protect IoT networks from cyberattacks. Each DL model has its potential benefit as reported in this paper. For example, the FFNN can handle complex IoT network traffic patterns, while the LSTM is good in capturing long-term dependencies present in the network traffic. With its random connections and flexible dynamics, the RandNN model uses its data learning ability to adapt and learn from network data. These algorithms boost cybersecurity by enabling defense mechanisms against challenging cyber threats and ensuring the security of sensitive data as IoT networks expand. The proposed technique exhibits superior performance when compared with the current state-of-the-art DL-IDS using the CIC-IoT22 dataset. An accuracy of 99.93 % is achieved for the FFNN model, 99.85 % for the LSTM model, and 96.42 % for the RandNN model in detecting intrusion. Moreover, the models have the potential to enhance intrusion detection in IoT networks by generating swift responses to security problems in IoT networks.",

Its small size makes it suitable for difficult environments.\nâ¢\nCost-Effectiveness and data Collection: The UAV model is cost-effective compared to traditional aircraft, facilitating affordable real-time data collection and transmission in various formats (brackets, images, videos) to smartphones or computers.\nAbstract\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable in replacing human pilots for high-risk, high-intensity operations, including search-and-rescue missions, infrastructure inspection, and environmental monitoring. As a key enabler of these operations, UAV task planning systems require advanced trajectory optimization to operate effectively in dynamic, complex environments. This paper presents an innovative model integrating fully fuzzy linear fractional transportation programming (FTMP) with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance UAV performance. Unlike conventional path-planning methods, the proposed model leverages bio-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and mixed-integer programming to solve multi-objective optimization problems under uncertainty. A critical feature of this platform is its ability to continuously adjust flight altitude based on real-time data, accounting for varying terrain morphology, fuel constraints, flight restrictions, and threats, thus ensuring optimal 3D trajectory planning. This makes the platform particularly effective in emergency scenarios such as natural disasters, explosions, or fires, where it supports rapid and accurate search-and-rescue efforts. The UAV system not only minimizes human involvement but also reduces the response time by transmitting real-time video, audio, and GPS data to responders over long distances. The proposed solution offers several advantages over traditional aerial platforms, including: (a) Precision tracking and path optimization with a demonstrated accuracy exceeding 88 % across recall, precision, and F-measure metrics. (b) Cost-effectiveness: The UAV is compact, lightweight, and affordable, significantly reducing operational expenses compared to helicopters. (c) Adaptability: Remote sensing allows for seamless control in rugged and obstructed environments. (d) Scalability: IoT integration supports multi-drone coordination for continuous real-time data collection and transmission to smartphones or command centers. This pragmatic UAV model offers transformative potential for emergency response, environmental monitoring, and smart infrastructure management, validating its reliability and efficiency through comprehensive performance metrics.",

Due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices and MEC devicesâ limited capabilities, tasks should be offloaded efficiently to MEC servers mainly and then to the Clouds (fog nodes) if necessary for fulfilling tasksâ computational requirements. The proposed solution presents a task offloading decision using base stations of the network and queued task scheduling. The base station, which is the edge orchestrator, will decide on where to offload (edge servers or cloud) or compute locally. For handling heterogeneous tasks, a maximum tolerable latency is included. It is shown that a 3% to 7% improvement in the number of failed tasks, more than 7.4% in the number of successfully completed tasks, an improvement by more than 0.85 s in the average execution time and more than 7% in network communication, which directly impacts the energy of edge devices. The simulation results show that this work performed better in decreasing the number of failed tasks due to latency, decreasing energy consumption and minimizing the average execution time of tasks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) environments are characterized by a high level of diversity and heterogeneity as there are numerous standards and approaches. This adds complexity and raises questions concerning enterprisesâ strategies, organizational structures, and technological capabilities. As a result, a tool is required to assist enterprises in their transition to IoT technologies and practices, as well as to guide them in improving their capabilities. Several Maturity Models (MM) have been developed for this purpose, to assist enterprises in understanding their current position and identifying the need for improvements based on guidelines and indicators. However, there are several gaps in current models due to the lack of IoT-specific assessment approaches and models. Therefore, existing models must be upgraded to take into consideration major gaps and recommendations. Our main goal, in this research, is to provide a structured methodology and a holistic model fitting to the IoT context. The main contributions of this paper are (i) firstly, it summarizes the current state of the art of IoT MM proposed by various initiatives in several countries while highlighting their origin, scope, objectives, and assessment approaches, and (ii) secondly it outlines the research gaps and limits of existing maturity models and (iii) thirdly it proposes a new IoT maturity assessment framework to better help companies to recognize their current situation regarding IoT transformation as well as undertaking the right improvement actions plans in a structured manner. The proposed framework includes a methodology and a maturity model with 5 levels, 5 dimensions, 13 sub-dimensions, and 62 assessment criteria. Afterward, a practical tool has been developed to provide a user-friendly self-assessment for companies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the performance of user equipments (UEs) and IoT devices in a multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) configuration based non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) system. The proposed model includes a base station surrounded by many users and a number of dispersed IoT devices. In the considered MU IoT network scenario, power allocation coefficients are set to ensure that both the relaying UE and the targeted IoT device experience increased performance. To assist the intended IoT device with weak channel conditions, an optimal user selection method is developed that picks a UE with comparatively better reception, and thereby the selected UE acts as relay forward node utilizing the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer protocol. The characterization of a key performance metric, i.e., the outage probability is derived by adopting a two-step procedure. First, quadratic forms of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the relaying UE and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and SINR at the intended IoT device are constructed. Then, using the indefinite quadratic form approach, we arrive at closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) of intended IoT device under linearly dependent beamformers. To validate the analytical expressions provided in this study, simulations are performed. We demonstrate that by utilizing the proposed user selection technique in MU-MISO-NOMA system decreases the OP of the intended IoT device by 40% on average. Furthermore, utilizing multiple transmit antenna elements decreases the OP of the intended IoT device by approximately 10%.",

However, compared to Europe and the United States, Japan has a short history of foot care massage, and a lack of instructors and knowledge is an issue. In this study, we developed a system to visualize the movement skills of foot care massage performed by expert using IoT. The visualization method includes acquiring and simultaneously presenting the expertâs posture during the foot care massage, video information showing the back of the foot including the calf, auditory information of the expertâs explanation, visual information using an eye tracker, and tactile information using a pressure sensor. The information is stored on an online storage system using IoT. The system is designed to enable learners to learn the stored information on a web application, and we believe that this system will make it possible to effectively learn the movement skills of foot care massage. In this paper, we report that we were able to visualize the movement skills that experts want to convey to learners based on their evaluation results, and developed a system to support the acquisition of movement skills by experts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, connected devices are progressively integrating our lifestyle, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). There are several domains where these IoT can be found, including industry, smart cities, energy, healthcare, smart homes, and so on. These devices bring with them a host of security threats, due to their many weaknesses such as limited resources and the fact that it is often out of date. This is why researchers have progressively turned to innovative techniques to face these threats, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In addition, IDS can be enhanced through machine learning (ML), which improves detection accuracy, adapts to new and evolving threats, identifies unknown threats, reduces false positives, and more. In this study, we conduct a review of the recent articles focusing on the integration of IDS and ML. Each method is evaluated based on attributes such as feature selection method, algorithms used, detection and false positive rates, security threats, and so on. This involves presenting a critical analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we present the most prevalent datasets containing deliberate attacks on test IoT networks. In addition, we cover the anomaly detection-based IDS method in depth, focusing on papers that use ML. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion by comparing all methods and identifying open re-search questions. As a result, summarized tables are provided to highlight each model.",

However, how to effectively schedule and manage resources in the Internet of Things environment has become an increasingly important issue. In order to solve this problem, a cloud scheduling simulation system for IoT resources in a digital intelligent environment has emerged. This system utilizes cloud computing and IoT technology to simulate the behavior of intelligent devices and deep learning technology, achieving efficient resource scheduling. In addition, experimental data shows that the accuracy of the IoT resource cloud scheduling simulation system based on deep learning algorithm combined with digital intelligent environment is over 70%; the average task processing time is within 0.3 seconds; the average task response time is within 0.6 seconds. From this, it can be seen that combining deep learning algorithms with the system can quickly respond and solve problems, improving the reliability and stability of the system. The application range of this system is very wide, which can be used to optimize resource scheduling in many fields such as production, and can also be applied in fields such as smart home, smart medical, and intelligent transportation. With the continuous development of technology, this system would also be further improved and expanded to better serve people's lives and work.",

With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and tools, there have been some efforts in recent years to automate such monitoring. This can significantly benefit beekeepers as they can obtain critical data and insight into their hives' health and performance more regularly. In this paper, we use IoT devices and the Thingsboard dashboard to track the status of 28 honey beehives installed in the Western region of North Carolina as part of the Appalachian Multi-Apiary Informatics System (AppMAIS) project. In order to acquire data from a beehive, humidity and temperature sensors, as well as a microphone, have been placed inside the hives. In addition, a video camera has been placed at the top of the hive's entrance to obtain video recordings of the bees entering and leaving the hives, and a scale is placed under the hive to report the weight. The data collected from the sensors and peripherals installed in each of the AppMAIS hives are sent to the Thingsboard dashboard for management and visualization. In this paper, we report on our success with Thingsboard IoT tool to monitor honey beehives and take advantage of their capabilities to interact with the devices as needed to adjust operational parameters.",

However, these developments also expose systems to novel cyber security risks as sophisticated threat actors exploit infrastructure vulnerabilities to access sensitive data or deploy malicious software, threatening patient safety, device reliability, and trust. This paper introduces a lightweight dynamic risk assessment approach using scenario-based simulations to analyse cyber security events in MIoT infrastructures and supplement cyber security activities within organisations. The approach includes synthetic data and threat models to enrich discrete-event simulations, offering a comprehensive understanding of emerging threats and their potential impact on healthcare settings. Our simulation scenario illustrates the modelâs behaviour in processing data flows and capturing the characteristics of healthcare settings. Our findings demonstrate its validity by highlighting potential threats and mitigation strategies. The insights from these simulations highlight the modelâs flexibility, enabling adaptation to various healthcare settings and supporting continuous risk assessment to enhance MIoT system security and resilience.",

We trained and tested 7 machine learning (ML) models with Orange 3 including kNN, Decision Tree (tree), SVM, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and AdaBoost (AB). With the original dataset, 5 ML models performed perfect classification. After pruning the dataset columns by keeping the features with the highest correlations with the label in the dataset, good classifications were obtained with only 4 TCP/IP features by the Gradient Boosting, kNN, and RF models with MSEs in the range 0.008-0.011, and R2s in the range 0.978-0.984. With only 6 MQTT features, Gradient Boosting, RF, Tree, and NN were the top classifiers with MSEs in the range 0.073-0.074, and R2s in the range 0.856-0.859. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of guiding the feature pruning process by the values of the correlation coefficients in order to minimize the long training times of ML models while achieving good accuracies.",

Designing and engineering these applications is still a challenge due to the lack of systematic approaches and reference architectures. In this paper, we introduce the Behavior-enabled IoT paradigm to help architects and engineers design complex IoT applications based on the integration of cyberâphysical systems with behavior-enabled models. We instantiate the approach by designing the architecture of a platform for governing a renewable energy community to provide an optimal trade-off between quality of service (i.e., maximizing shared load) and quality of experience (i.e., ensuring a satisfying comfort to community people) through the production of day-ahead scheduling based on expressed people preferences. The architecture is designed following a specific methodology for developing BeT systems and the obtained platform has been tested in a simulated environment. The results show the potential benefits for the community in terms of revenues, quality of experience, and quality of services. BeT-driven strategies, such as day-ahead scheduling for user device activation, provide a cost-effective way to match consumption to renewable energy production and prove to be an alternative to battery storage support systems or even an improvement.",

Internet of Things is the one among them and used for automatic smart farming applications. Hence to overcome the issues faced in the wide agriculture sector most of the farmers are now changed to IoT based applications and in the meantime many scientists also used artificial intelligence techniques to predict the diseases of the crops from the data collected using the IoT sensors in the agriculture farming. The sensors gather data from crops and fused with the local unit and forwarded to the cluster heads of network. To achieve the disease free crops and therein improve the productivity we have proposed a novel energy efficient IoT based smart farming approach, in which we have utilized K-means algorithm for the cluster formation and Adaptive Mud Ring optimization algorithm (AMR) for CH and energy efficient optimal path. The collected data via the CH are then stored in the cloud storage. Subsequently, the data are accessed via the proposed Hybrid Artificial Neural Network (HANN) to predict the diseases. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is hybridized using the Google Net in order to extract the exact features to predict the diseases. Performance validation is effectuated with Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) software and the results are compared with the state-of-art works. Several parameters such as energy efficiency, delay, network lifetime, accuracy and etc, are used for analyzing and our approach surpasses all the other approaches.",

Edge resources are limited when compared to traditional Cloud data centres; hence the choice of proper resource management strategies in this context becomes paramount. Microservice and Function as a Service architectures support modular and agile patterns, compared to a monolithic design, through lightweight containerisation, continuous integration / deployment and scaling. The advantages brought about by these technologies may initially seem obvious, but we argue that their usage at the Edge deserves a more in-depth evaluation. By analysing both the software development and deployment lifecycle, along with performance and resource utilisation, this paper explores microservices and two alternative types of serverless functions to build edge real-time IoT analytics. In the experiments comparing these technologies, microservices generally exhibit slightly better end-to-end processing latency and resource utilisation than serverless functions. One of the serverless functions and the microservices excel at handling larger data streams with auto-scaling. Whilst serverless functions natively offer this feature, the choice of container orchestration framework may determine its availability for microservices. The other serverless function, while supporting a simpler lifecycle, is more suitable for low-invocation scenarios and faces challenges with parallel requests and inherent overhead, making it less suitable for real-time processing in demanding IoT settings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks (WITSN) play a pivotal role in modern society, facilitating a myriad of applications ranging from smart homes to industrial automation. Therefore, safeguarding these networks against security threats is paramount to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted within them. However, WITSNs face escalating security threats due to their diverse structures and platforms. Existing literature has identified these vulnerabilities but lacks comprehensive solutions to address them effectively. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel security approach termed Randomized Bi-Phase Authentication Scheme (RBAS), which integrates digital watermarking techniques to fortify both external and internal network security. RBAS not only tackles data availability, confidentiality, and authenticity challenges prevalent in WITSNs but also strives to maintain a delicate equilibrium between robust security measures and energy efficiency. Key contributions of this work include the meticulous examination and validation of the integration of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes in IoT sensor network authentication, demonstrating their efficacy in error detection through simulations. Furthermore, RBAS employs advanced hashing, cryptography, and dynamic verification codes to ensure strong error detection and data authenticity, leveraging robust CRC codes and randomization to thwart potential attacks. The scheme's complexity acts as a deterrent against manipulation, while its cluster awareness enhances adaptability, and cryptographic principles bolster overall security. Extensive performance evaluation using the Network Simulator-2 (NS2) reveals significant benefits of RBAS, including an 8 % reduction in power consumption and a 7 % increase in network longevity. Notably, RBAS surpasses existing solutions with a 14 % reduction in dropping ratio and an 8 % decrease in latency. The success of RBAS stems from its innovative utilization of lightweight watermarking techniques and cluster-based routing, enabling proactive identification of data tampering and thereby enhancing the network's overall security posture. This pioneering work not only advances the state of the art in WITSN security but also holds profound implications for the practical deployment of secure and efficient IoT sensor networks in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCrop yield is a serious concern for farmers due to irregular irrigation, soil erosion, uncontrolled seed planting, severe weather conditions, peasants, and unpredicted locust infestations. The lack of current data and the intricacy of traditional agriculture leads to inefficiency and excessive operation costs. Smart farming with Artificial Intelligence techniques and the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture overcome these challenges by connecting all the accessible data sources into a single, fully effective functional unit. Smart agriculture helps in the sustainability of food production by using minimum resources such as water, fertilizer, and seeds. It provides a better understanding of the soil, crop, and changing weather. Furthermore, the sensors in the system assist in monitoring and controlling the resources. In this research, we present ensemble-based machine learning approaches in the IoT environment to predict crop yields and enable sustainable farming by guiding the farmers to grow the correct crop during the correct season to increase their yields. The proposed method uses a novel ensemble-based machine learning classification approach with two levels of predictions-level-0 prediction includes (Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) classifiers are input as features to the level-1 meta classifier (Random Forest) to detect the distinct categories of different crops. Its predictions can be extremely close to the ground truth, which accurately predicts 22 categories of crops with 99% accuracy. Hence, the proposed Smart agriculture system can assist farmers in improved yield production and remote monitoring at low cost.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe pervasiveness and high number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in peopleâs daily lives make this context a very critical attack surface for cyber threats. The high heterogeneity of involved entities, both in terms of hardware and software characteristics, does not allow the definition of uniform, global, and efficient security solutions. Therefore, researchers have started to investigate novel mechanisms, in which a super node (a gateway, a hub, or a router) analyzes the interactions of the target node with other peers in the network, to detect possible anomalies. The most recent of these strategies base such an analysis on the modeling of the fingerprint of a node behavior in an IoT; nevertheless, existing solutions do not cope with the fully distributed nature of the referring scenario.\nIn this paper, we try to provide a contribution in this setting, by designing a novel and fully distributed trust model exploiting point-to-point devicesâ behavioral fingerprints, a distributed consensus mechanism, and Blockchain technology. In our solution we tackle the non-trivial issue of equipping smart things with a secure mechanism to evaluate, also through their neighbors, the trustworthiness of an object in the network before interacting with it. Beyond the detailed description of our framework, we also illustrate the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIoT repackaging refers to an attack devoted to tampering with a legitimate firmware package by modifying its content (e.g., injecting some malicious code) and re-distributing it in the wild. In such a scenario, the firmware delivery and update processes are central to ensuring firmware integrity.\nUnfortunately, several existing solutions lack proper integrity verification, exposing firmware to repackaging attacks. If this is not the case, they still require an external trust anchor (e.g., signing keys or secure storage technologies), which could limit their adoption in resource-constrained environments. In addition, state-of-the-art frameworks do not cope with the entire firmware production and delivery process, thereby failing to protect the content generated by the firmware producers through the whole supply chain.\nTo mitigate such a problem, in this paper, we introduce PARIOT, a novel self-protecting scheme for IoT that injects integrity checks, called anti-tampering (AT) controls, directly into the firmware. The AT controls enable the runtime detection of repackaging attempts without needing signing keys, internet connection, secure storage technologies, or external trusted parties. PARIOT can be adopted on top of existing state-of-the-art solutions ensuring the widest compatibility with current IoT ecosystems and update frameworks. Also, we have implemented this scheme into PARIOTIC, a prototype to protect C/C++ IoT firmware automatically. The evaluation phase of 50 real-world firmware samples demonstrated the proposed methodologyâs feasibility and robustness against practical repackaging attacks without altering the firmware behavior or severe overheads.",

We introduce a novel load balancing clustering algorithm based on Simulated Annealing whose main goal is to increase network lifetime while maintaining adequate sensing coverage in scenarios where sensor nodes produce non-uniform data traffic. Through simulations on the Cooja/Contiki simulationâemulation platform, we compare the proposed algorithm to leading state-of-the-art clustering approaches and show that our algorithm is able to improve both time until first clusterhead failure as well as network coverage by keeping more sensor nodes alive for a longer periods of time. We also explore different clustering criteria applied to our simulated annealing clustering framework and investigated different network lifetime metrics. We show that accounting for both workload and communication cost improves network lifetime by prolonging clusterhead lifetime and that clustering solely on the basis of physical distance improves network coverage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe increased utilization of non-renewable energy during the last century has influenced the climate, with increased carbon dioxide emissions and elevated temperature as a result. Thus, the need to develop and demonstrate new sustainable solutions regarding both energy supply and consumption, but also energy system optimization, is obvious. This case study presents the nano-size off-grid energy system at the Meteoria visitor center in Ostrobothnia, Finland, and the real-time measuring techniques that have been installed to follow up the energy production and consumption. The Meteoria consists of several buildings, which are open to the public from April to October. The case site is operated by energy derived from wind power, solar power, and a diesel generator (as a backup), with batteries for energy storage. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been retrofitted to the existing energy system to enable energy measurements and follow various electrical parameters in real-time. In addition, a graphical visualization platform open to the public has been developed. In this study, the completeness of data sampling and the IoT system was checked, and the results show high availability of data. Furthermore, various errors/limitations regarding the IoT system were identified. The energy supply/demand at the Meteoria in 2021 was monitored and the challenges regarding the existing energy system in a cold climate zone are discussed as well as the potential role of the Meteoria to function as a living lab.",

In order to perform a systematic review of the engineering literature related to the interest topic in this work, a bidirectional review methodology consisting of the following three phases has been proposed and applied: review planning, review conducting, and review reporting. Then, soft-processor architectures implementing security algorithms are compared considering computational cost, speed, bus size, number of pipeline stages, and performance. Finally, based on a feature analysis, the strengths and threats of soft-processors when implementing information security for Internet of Things applications are discussed, and the LORS design model is proposed to lead to recommendations for future designs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSignificant benefits have been brought to various industries by IoT (Internet of Things), but new security challenges have also been introduced due to the sheer volume and complexity of IoT systems. The protection of IoT systems from attacks and the assurance of their security posture are ensured by intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Recently, machine learning (ML) strategies have been broadly adopted for IDSs in IoT systems. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in addressing the physical and functional diversity of IoT systems. A hybrid metaheuristics-deep learning approach is proposed in this paper for enhancing intrusion detection in IoT systems. An advanced metaheuristics algorithm with an ensemble of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be utilized to enhance the intrusion detection in IoT. Different types of attacks in IoT systems are identified by employing LSTM and GRU models, which constitute the RNNs. Feature selections are performed using Harris hawk optimization and fractional derivative mutation, as employed in this paper. To assess the proposed approach, publicly available datasets were utilized, and the empirical analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach works well than the other related methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, the proposed work presents a promising solution for enhancing intrusion detection in IoT systems, and it has the potential to serve as a foundation for future research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMaritime transport is an indispensable element of the global logistics network. Most maritime loading-unloading operations are supported by quay cranes, making their availability and condition critical to port operations. This work identifies discordant trends arising during the vibration-based condition monitoring of these quay cranes in one of the busiest container ports in the United Kingdom. This work proposes an unsupervised and constrained discord detection approach for irregular but near real-time time series data obtained from multi-modal IoT-based condition monitoring sensors installed on these cranes and transmitted over a 5G network. Due to the live nature of the seaportâs operations, the development of controlled anomaly signatures for a baseline reference was not possible. To address the challenges of incomplete asset health information, irregular and batched time-series sensor data, massive data volumes, and the lack of the assetsâ vibration signature baselines, this paper proposes an unsupervised, robust, and fast discord detection mechanism that can rapidly highlight discordant time-series chunks in the received vibration data at a central server. A Support Vector Machine based One-Class Classifier (OCC-SVM) is used to identify the discordant vibration signatures in the time series data. During the development of this approach, the timestamped data chunks from the add-on IoT-based vibration sensors were clustered into two weight classes (loaded and unloaded) based on the craneâs default Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) sensors. The efficacy of this method is checked against the crane maintenance logs and data from a separate craneâs vibration and PLC data. Further, a method for generating synthetic noise-embedded vibration signatures to test the effectiveness of the discord detection method has been devised. Finally, the practicality of the proposed OCC-SVM approach for discord detection was inspected in a constrained environment setting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAddressing air pollution presents a significant environmental challenge in the context of smart city environments. Real-time monitoring of pollution data empowers local authorities to assess current traffic conditions and make informed decisions accordingly. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors has revolutionized air quality prediction, with human activities being the primary contributors to air pollution, posing threats to all forms of life. Gases such as SO2, PM10, O3, CO, NO2, among others, are key pollutants. Exposure to air pollution can lead to severe health issues and fatalities, underscoring the criticality of air quality monitoring. Distinguishing between breathable and non-breathable air quality further enhances the value of air quality monitoring. However, existing techniques face challenges in achieving high accuracy, exacerbated by missing values in datasets, which can significantly impact machine learning model performance. In response to these challenges, this research introduces an IoT-based automated system designed to classify air quality. This system is adept at managing missing data and attaining high accuracy levels. Central to this approach is a stacked ensemble voting classifier model, which combines two machine learning models. Additionally, the system incorporates the KNN Imputer to address missing values effectively. The work assesses the systemâs performance against seven alternative machine learning algorithms across two scenarios: one with missing values removed and another with KNN imputation applied. Notably, the proposed strategy achieves remarkable metrics, including 99.17% accuracy, 97.75% precision, 95.24% recall, and a 96.52% F1 score, when leveraging the KNN Imputer. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to current state-of-the-art methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the development of smart agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) projects, the need for extensive collaboration among agricultural devices from different domains has surged, necessitating the authentication of device identities for secure communication. Existing centralized architecture-dependent authentication mechanisms encounter issues like a sole point of failure and inefficiencies. Most authentication schemes are unable to support plentiful devices synchronously connecting to numerous data servers in other domains. To address these problems, we propose a many-to-many cross-domain authentication scheme based on the hybrid blockchain architecture for smart agriculture IoT networks. The scheme enables multiple devices simultaneously executing mutual authentication with several data service providers from other agricultural systems. This paper designs a groupable batch verification (GBV) algorithm that dynamically adjusts the batch size by performing group verification for a list of requests, enhancing the flexibility of cross-domain batch authentication. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides a pseudonym update mechanism to protect the privacy of devices and guards services of different domains from illegal access by tracking malicious devices. The security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior security features and performance.",

Achieving this integration efficiently necessitates significant improvements in reducing latency and enhancing data throughput. In response to these challenges, we propose the development of a specialized satellite architecture alongside a novel algorithm focused on call access and admission control within Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems. This solution leverages an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven approach, employing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to automate satellite operations through advanced beam localization techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a beam protocol that seamlessly integrates this automated learning mechanism into its operational framework. The efficacy of our proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through simulation studies of a multibeam satellite system, demonstrating the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning in facilitating dynamic resource allocation with improved efficiency.",

However, it also exposes sensitive information, which leads to privacy risks. An approach called N-source anonymity has been used for privacy preservation in raw data collection, but most of the existing schemes do not have a balanced efficiency and robustness. In this work, a lightweight and efficient raw data collection scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme can not only collect data from the original users but also protect their privacy. Besides, the proposed scheme can resist user poisoning attacks, and the use of the reward method can motivate users to actively provide data. Analysis and simulation indicate that the proposed scheme is safe against poison attacks. Additionally, the proposed scheme has better performance in terms of computation and communication overhead compared to existing methods. High efficiency and appropriate incentive mechanisms indicate that the scheme is practical for IoT systems.",

However, existing drive-by structural health monitoring (SHM) methods acquire vehicle vibration responses offline and export them to a computer for postprocessing. Furthermore, the vehicle trajectory information on the bridge is important for scaling up the drive-by SHM for in situ applications, which is not synchronously measured by existing systems. Therefore, a single-board computer-based IoT sensing system for continuous and real-time drive-by bridge health monitoring is developed in this study. The developed IoT sensing system integrates a triaxial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer, temperature sensor, GPS and 4G module on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The sensor node can be mounted on a moving vehicle to collect the triaxial acceleration responses, temperature and GPS information. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed based on the Python Tkinter package to remotely control the sensor node and visualise the collected data in real time. The fast Fourier transform of the measured acceleration responses is performed on the sensor node inboard processor. The raw data are sent to both the cloud server and remote terminal computer through a 4G module. The goal is to provide a low-cost, accurate and scalable sensing system for easy implementation of drive-by bridge health monitoring. The system architecture and workflow of the developed IoT sensing system are presented in detail. A series of experimental tests are conducted to validate the accuracy of the measured acceleration responses and feasibility of using the developed IoT sensing system for drive-by SHM applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIoT-based applications are growing in popularity nowadays because they offer effective answers to numerous current problems. In this research, With the aim of decreasing human efforts for monitoring the power units and increasing users' knowledge of excessive electricity usage, an IoT-based electric metre surveillance system utilising an Android platform has been developed. With the help of an Arduino Uno and an optical sensor, the electric analyser pulse is captured. To reduce human mistake and the expense of energy usage, a low-cost wireless network of sensors for digital energy metres is implemented alongside a smartphone application that can autonomously read the metre of the unit. In this research, an intelligent power monitoring system with effective communication modules has been developed to make wise use of the electricity. The controller, NB-IoT connection module, and cloud are the three main components of an IOT-based smart energy metre system. The controller is essential for maintaining the functionality of each component. This solution reduces the need for human involvement in electricity maintenance by connecting energy metres to the cloud using an NB-IoT communication module. The IoT-based metre reading system in the proposed work is created to monitor and analyse the metre reading, and the service provider can cut off the source of electricity whenever the customer fails to pay the monthly bill. It also eliminates the need for human intervention, provides accurate metre reading, and guards against billing errors. The proposed SPM improves the overall accuracy ranges of 7.42, 27.83, and 20% better than DR, OREM, and SLN respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNet Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) represent a significant opportunity to reduce building energy consumption and achieve the climate and energy goals that will be necessary in the future. Nevertheless, the effective operation and maintenance (O&M) management of NZEB remains a significant challenge. This is largely due to the inadequate management of the O&M phase and the lack of comprehensive data integration and application. Accordingly, this study proposes an O&M digital twin modeling approach for integrating data in the O&M phase of NZEB and realizing efficient management. The twin modeling process comprises data collection, model construction, simulation analysis, and validation iteration. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed twin model markedly enhances the utilization efficiency of O&M data, facilitating the perception, visualization, and automated feedback control of NZEB. The proposed digital twin modeling method offers technical guidance for O&M managers seeking to achieve efficient O&M management of NZEB.",

While this opens up favorable scenarios, it also raises new challenges. The huge amount of data collected and processed by ML applications requires efficient and scalable solutions that contrast with the constrained capabilities of IoT devices as for memory, power consumption, processing and network bandwidth. The TinyML technologies foster the adoption of ML algorithms running locally on IoT devices. However, they typically foresee a remote training process (e.g., on cloud servers) combined with local inference â a strategy not always viable, e.g., for privacy and security issues.\nWe present a technique to enable the on-board training of ML algorithms on IoT devices, through the combination of federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL). We experimentally analyze it in classification and regression problems, comparing it to traditional FL solutions, as well as with a consolidated technique based on Tensorflow Lite. Results show that FL with TL reaches accuracy values better than FL without TL in both classification (86.48%) and regression (0.0201). These results are comparable with a model trained on the full dataset. We further analyze training and inference time and power consumption on various devices. Finally, we evaluate how the performance changes with unbalanced training datasets, showing that although they strongly impact accuracy, FL makes models more robust, letting them achieve accuracy comparable to when trained on balanced datasets.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThe study concentrates on designing an optimal energy trading service architecture within a peer-to-peer nano-grid network, with a primary focus on achieving two distinct objectives.\nâ¢\nOne key contribution lies in minimizing energy trading costs in the peer-to-peer nano-grid architecture. This is achieved by employing a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based objective function, driven by predicted and actual load values. Predictive load values are generated using the tabNET architecture, and these predictions are benchmarked against BD-LSTM, a state-of-the-art approach.\nâ¢\nThe study's second significant contribution is the optimization of Energy Storage System (ESS) power. This optimization is realized through the application of a PSO-based objective function, enhancing the efficiency of energy trading operations among connected peers in the nano-grid.\nâ¢\nAnother noteworthy aspect of this research is the implementation of a digital twin-based concept. This approach virtualizes the entire energy trading process by replicating physical resources such as photovoltaic and ESS components involved in the trading process.\nâ¢\nTo gauge the system's potential, the study conducts a case study using data from 24 nano-grid households equipped with photovoltaic and ESS installations. This assessment encompasses the optimization modules.\nâ¢\nPerformance Evaluation: The virtualization module's performance is assessed through standard evaluation measures, including round trip time (RTT), latency, throughput analysis, and response time analysis.\nâ¢\nComparison with State-of-the-Art: Additionally, a comparative analysis is conducted against existing studies to establish the significance and contributions of this research in relation to the current state-of-the-art in nano-grid energy trading optimization.\nAbstract\nOver the past decade, IoT-orchestrated frameworks have demonstrated significant advantages in enhancing the performance of mission-critical applications. However, distributed generation systems like microgrids and nanogrids have not fully harnessed the capabilities of IoT technology to address the limitations of conventional methods. The effectiveness of a nanogrid's energy trading system depends on several factors, including the efficient management of core components like energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy devices. To address these issues, we introduce an optimal power management system for nanogrid energy trading. This system incorporates an RNN prediction module to provide valuable insights to energy distributors. It comprises three core optimization modules: (1) Minimizing Grid Power Consumption, (2) Optimizing Energy Trading Costs, and (3) Managing ESS Power. Our proposed model operates within an IoT-orchestrated framework, utilizing IoT sensors and Raspberry Pi-based Edge technology for virtual execution of operations. We evaluate the model's performance through a case study involving data from 12 nanogrid-equipped houses, resulting in a robust energy trading optimization system. Furthermore, the outcomes of IoT orchestration highlight the potential for virtual operations to enhance system performance significantly.",

This article evaluates the various sensors used for water quality monitoring and focuses on the water quality index considering the multiple physical, chemical, and biological parameters. A Review of Internet of Things (IoT) research for water quality monitoring and analysis, sensors used for water quality can help remote monitoring of the water quality parameters using various IoT-based sensors that convey the assembled estimations utilizing Low-Power Wide Area Network innovations. Overall, the IoT system was 95 % accurate in measuring pH, Turbidity, TDS, and Temperature, while the traditional method was only 85 % accurate. Also, this study reviewed the different A.I. techniques used to assess water quality, including conventional machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, and K-nearest neighbors. Compared to traditional methods, machine learning and deep learning can significantly increase the accuracy of measurements of groundwater quality. However, various variables, such as the caliber of the training data, the water quality metrics' complexity, and the monitoring frequency, will affect the accuracy. The geographical information system (GIS) is used for spatial data analysis and managing water resources. The quality of its data is also reviewed in the paper.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article delineates the design and deployment of an innovative real-time water quality monitoring system tailored for rural regions, focusing on monitoring the water resource quality parameters. We propose a solar-powered, waterproof, portable, and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled solution that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. Central to this system is a sophisticated LoRa node outfitted with an array of sensors for capturing key water parameters, such as pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity and temperature. A conjunction of an Arduino microcontroller-based board and a LoRa shield facilitates real-time data capture and transmission to a LoRaWAN gateway. The acquired data is transmitted to The Things Network server, which is seamlessly integrated with a ThingSpeak web-based IoT server and ThingView mobile applications. We incorporate a solar cell with a solar shield to ensure sustainable energy provision for powering the entire system through a rechargeable battery. This allows users to access vital water quality information online simultaneously and continuously in real-time. As a testament to its robustness, the system was empirically tested at Gambang Lake to demonstrate its effectiveness, functionality, buoyancy, and waterproof capabilities. We further validated the results by comparing them with laboratory sample analysis findings. Experimental evaluations confirmed the system's reliability, as evidenced by the strong agreement between the water conditions measured using our solution and those obtained from laboratory instruments. Moreover, our system efficiently and remotely updated data across multiple IoT platforms using the LoRa radio interface over the LoRaWAN gateway.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (105KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nWQMS-LoRaWAN",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancements of IoT and blockchain, a novel era has emerged in the domain of smart building systems. At the same time, it also brings some problems and challenges. Most traditional solutions typically utilize the fully-replicated storage strategy that results in high storage costs, while recent solutions like coded blockchain may compromise query efficiency. Moreover, traditional reputation-based consensus schemes do not consider dynamic situations, limiting scalability. To handle these problems, we propose a novel hierarchical message aggregation scheme and a classified storage method under ReedâSolomon (RS) coding to minimize storage overhead while ensuring data recoverability and query performance. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic incentive reputation consensus mechanism to tackle scalability challenges such as preventing node monopolies, promoting new node integration, and enhancing fault tolerance. Through theoretical analysis and experimental simulation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a high degree of decentralization and scalability. Our scheme achieves a 20% reduction in the Gini coefficient compared to other approaches. Furthermore, our scheme can save\nof storage overhead compared to traditional solutions while maintaining high query performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the rapid progress of communication technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an essential element in our daily lives. Given that the IoT encompasses diverse devices that often have limited resources in terms of communication, computation, and storage. Consequently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardized several lightweight cryptographic algorithms for encryption and decryption, specifically designed to meet the needs of resource-constrained IoT devices. These cryptographic algorithms, known as authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), offer more than just confidentialityâthey also guarantee information integrity and authentication. Unlike conventional encryption algorithms like AES, which solely provide confidentiality, AEAD algorithms encompass additional functionality to achieve authenticity. This eliminates the need for separate algorithms like message authentication codes to ensure authenticity. Therefore, by leveraging the characteristics of an AEAD protocol, it is possible to develop a lightweight authentication framework to mitigate the security risks inherent in public communication channels. Therefore, in this work, we designed the lightweight authentication protocol for the smart healthcare system (BLAP-SHS) using an AEAD mechanism. In order to do this, a session key must first be created for encrypted communication. This is done via a method called mutual authentication, which verifies the legitimacy of both the user and the server. The random-or-real methodology ensures the security of the derived session key, and the Scyther tool is used to assess BLAP-SHSâ resistance to man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Through using the technique of informal security analysis, the resilience of BLAP-SHS against denial of service, and password-guessing threats are evaluated. By juxtaposing BLAP-SHS with other prominent authentication techniques, the usefulness of BLAP-SHS is also assessed in terms of computing and communication costs. We illustrate that the BLAP-SHS requires a reduction in computation cost ranging from [70.11% to 95.21%] and a reduction in communication resources ranging from [3.85% to 9.09%], as evidenced by our comparative study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWater quality is a critical factor in shrimp farming, and the success of shrimp production is closely tied to the overall condition of the water. Challenges such as rapid population growth, environmental pollution, and global warming have led to a decline in fisheries production, particularly in the freshwater shrimp sector. This study addresses these challenges by monitoring multiple water parameters in shrimp farms, including pH, temperature, TDS, EC, and salinity. Traditional manual monitoring systems are known to be cumbersome, time-consuming, and lacking real-time capabilities. Consequently, a continuous and automated monitoring system becomes imperative for efficient and real-time metrics handling. This study introduces a real-time freshwater shrimp (locally named Galda, i.e., Macrobrachium Rosenbergii) farm monitoring system. The proposed system incorporates technologies such as microcontroller-based physical devices, IoT, cloud storage with service, machine learning models, and web applications. This integrated system enables users to remotely monitor shrimp farms and receive alerts when water parameters fall outside the optimal range. The physical implementation involves a set of sensors for collecting data on water metrics in shrimp farms. Regression analysis is employed for predicting next-day values, and a newly developed decision-based algorithm classifies shrimp production levels into low, medium, and maximum categories using six well-known classification algorithms. The system demonstrates a high success rate for next-day predictions (r2 of 0.94) by multiple linear regression, and the accuracy in classifying shrimp production is 97.84 % by Random Forest. Additionally, a âSmart Aquaculture Analyticsâ web application has been developed, offering features such as real-time dashboards, historical data visualization, prediction and classification tools, and automated notifications to farmers in Bangladesh.",

This paper aims to enhance the performance characteristics of FBG sensors for temperature measurement by proposing a specific design of their parameters, thus facilitating their implementation in IoT applications. The FBG temperature sensor is designed to operate in the 1500â1600 nm wavelength range. The outcomes display a high sensitivity of 0.61 nm/Â°C with a Full Width Half Maxima (FWHM) of 7.893 nm and a Figure of Merit (FOM) of 7.72 x 10â2/Â°C. The calculated Quality Factor (Q) of the sensor was 195.67. When compared with previous studies in the literature, our obtained results confirm the enhanced performance of the proposed design of the FBG sensor, which render it suitable for utilization in most industrial use cases, especially in harsh environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDevices that are employed in applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) are constrained by limited energy resources. Consequently, ensuring a continuous supply of energy while also maintaining uninterrupted connectivity within IoT units (IoTUs) is of great importance. In this particular context, we present a scheme that facilitates both, the transfer of wireless power and the transmission of information for IoTUs along with the capability of harvesting solar energy. This scheme is further supported by the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and the deployment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for communication purposes. To be more precise, initially, IoTUs obtain energy from the UAV through the process of wireless power transmission (WPT). Subsequently, in the second stage, the UAV retrieves data from the IoTUs using transmitting information. In order to simplify the complexity of the communication issue, we assume that a solar-powered UAV remains stationary at a predetermined altitude. Our objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the entire network by coordinating the scheduling of IoTU energy harvesting (EH) and UAV trajectory optimization. We suggest a multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MFRL) algorithm that maximizes EE through parameter optimization in order to achieve this goal. By utilizing the collective experiences of several agents and reducing energy usage, this algorithm also improves the overall performance of the system. The proposed technique achieves 96.3% and 97.5% accuracy in communication rounds and RIS elements, with a\nincrease in EE compared to the best-performing benchmark scheme. The suggested approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of EE, trajectory optimization, and learning accuracy, according to simulation findings.",

In this paper, we present an approach to address this shortage and skills gap through the development of cybersecurity education courseware for internet of things (IoT) applications.\nTo attract students and workers into the field of cybersecurity, it is important to design courseware that is exciting and tied to real-world problems. We describe our design for an embedded systems course taught at the graduate level for engineering and computer science students. The innovation in our approach is to select the fast-growing domain of healthcare and feature different IoT sensors that are seeing increased usage. These include barcode scanners, cameras, fingerprint sensors, and pulse sensors. These devices cover important functions such as patient identification, monitoring, and creating electronic health records. We use a password protected MySQL database as a model for electronic health records. We also demonstrate potential vulnerabilities of these databases to SQL injection attacks.\nWe administered these labs and collected survey data from the students. We found a significant increase in student understanding of cybersecurity issues. The mean confidence level of the students in cybersecurity issues increased from 2.5 to 4.1 on a 5-point scale after taking this course, which represents a 65% increase. The instructional lab material has been uploaded to the web portal https://clark.center designated by the National Security Agency for dissemination. Our approach, design, and experimental validation methodology will be useful for educators, researchers, students, and organizations interested in re-skilling their workforce.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCiphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) enables fine-grained access control on ciphertexts, making it a promising approach for managing data stored in the cloud-enabled Internet of Things. But existing schemes often suffer from privacy breaches due to explicit attachment of access policies or partial hiding of critical attribute content. Additionally, resource-constrained IoT devices, especially those adopting wireless communication, frequently encounter affordability issues regarding decryption costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fine-grained access control scheme with fully hidden policies (named FHAC). FHAC conceals all attributes in the policy and utilizes bloom filters to efficiently locate them. A test phase before decryption is applied to assist authorized users in finding matches between their attributes and the access policy. Dictionary attacks are thwarted by providing unauthorized users with invalid values. The heavy computational overhead of both the test phase and most of the decryption phase is outsourced to two cloud servers. Additionally, users can verify the correctness of multiple outsourced decryption results simultaneously. Security analysis and performance comparisons demonstrate FHAC's effectiveness in protecting policy privacy and achieving efficient decryption.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the exponential growth in connected smart devices that interchange sensitive, crucial, and personal data over the Internet of Things (IoT)-based cyberspace, IoT becomes undefended to cyber assaults. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a vital segment of security tool to detect cyber assaults. However, IDS produce high False Positive Rate (FPR) because IDS improves accuracy at the same time as it increases FPR. Therefore, a more effective cyber assaults detection system is needed. Based on the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an approach to recognizing cyber assaults in the IoT environment. This approach first performs various data pre-processing steps. Next, important features are optimized using modified Binary Pigeon Inspired Optimizer. After that, optimized feature subset is fed separately to the monolithic classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and bagging-based ensemble model such as Random Forest (RF) for detection of cyber assaults. In this study, UNSW-NB15 is used to test the success of the system, and related existing methods are compared with these results. Based on the results of the experiment, the proposed system with RF is the most effective in terms of accuracy (99.41%), F1-score (99.33%), detection rate (99.09%), and precision (99.92%) with a minimum FPR (0.03%) for a subset of optimized features (4 independent features out of 42).",

Despite the increased gain in production through IoT, there are still challenges that need to be properly tackled for wider adoption. Traditional authentication and authorization mechanisms cannot be blindly applied to IoT due to the associated limitations. This tutorial presented a solution for an IoT Farm scenario, with multiple authentications across different geographic locations with a centralized identity provider and application in the cloud, and IoT devices on the edge. The proposed approach relies on standard protocols and tools, like Keycloak, as the identity management solution. By using OpenID Connect (OIDC), we can assure a secure federated authentication and authorization of both users and IoT devices for IoT farming scenarios.",

In order to provide energy to the UAVR, we consider the hybrid simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) method, which allows the UAVR to harvest energy from the source (i.e., sink node) signal. Herein, a hybrid time switching (TS)-based and power splitting (PS)-based relaying scheme is applied to improve the UAVRâs energy harvesting (EH) efficiency and the system performance. Given this context, we derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) for the sensors to evaluate the network performance. Based on the achieved analytical results, we apply the bat algorithm optimization (BAO) method to determine the optimal working point (as a fraction of received power and power allocation coefficients, and the 3-D positions of the UAVR) for the system such that the OP is minimized. The numerical analysis indicates that BAO is effective in both exploring and exploiting solutions, making it a suitable choice for similar non-convex optimization problems in continuous search spaces for cooperative NOMA IoT networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nByzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) systems are able to maintain the availability and integrity of IoT systems, in the presence of failure of individual components, random data corruption or malicious attacks. Fault-tolerant systems in general are essential in assuring continuity of service for mission-critical applications. However, their implementation may be challenging and expensive. In this study, IoT Systems with BFT are considered. Analytical models and solutions are presented as well as a detailed analysis for the evaluation of the availability. BFT is particularly important for blockchain mechanisms, and in turn for IoT, since it can provide a secure, reliable and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices to communicate and transact with each other. A continuous-time Markov chain is used to model the IoT systems with BFT where the breakdown and repair times follow exponential distributions, and the number of the Byzantine nodes in the network follows various distributions. The presented numerical findings demonstrate the relationship between the number of nodes in the system, the proportion of honest users, and the overall availability. Based on the model, it can be inferred that the correlation between the scale of the system (nodes) and network availability is non-linear. Additionally, results show that even for relatively small-size systems with 40 nodes, an average availability greater than 0.999 and an estimated downtime per year that is less than 9 h is possible.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the rapid increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, massive amounts of sensitive IoT data are being generated and transmitted over the Internet. Despite its growing adoption in various fields, IoT security remains a major challenge requiring further research. IoT authentication is an essential security mechanism for building trust in IoT systems. However, conventional authentication approaches use expensive cryptographic primitives that do not align with the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices. Furthermore, centralized authentication schemes have proven to be inapplicable for cross-domain authentication and do not limit the scalability of IoT networks. Recently, blockchain technology has been applied to building decentralized authentication between IoT devices. Nevertheless, most existing blockchain-based authentication approaches incur high overhead in IoT computation, storage, and energy consumption. Authentication time is another critical issue in real-time IoT systems. When numerous IoT authentication requests are transferred to the blockchain, an additional time delay is imposed, in addition to the high computational cost of the blockchain caused by the consensus mechanism. This study proposes a hybrid centralized and blockchain-based authentication architecture for IoT systems. Edge servers are deployed to provide centralized authentication for associated IoT devices. A blockchain network of centralized edge servers is then established to ensure decentralized authentication and verification of IoT devices that belong to different and heterogeneous IoT systems. Lightweight cryptographic methods are implemented to achieve efficient authentication, in which limiting the consumption of IoT resources is required. The architecture is demonstrated using a local Ethereum blockchain network. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in terms of computation cost, execution time, and power consumption for IoT compared with centralized and blockchain-based authentication schemes. A security analysis proves the ability of our architecture to mitigate attacks and satisfy the IoT security requirements.",

Data security is a significant problem since training and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier often involves compiling tagged IoT data from several organizations. Beyond causing the suppliers to lose money, disclosing sensitive information might cause significant problems. To solve these issues, introduced a secure SVM, which is a Privacy-Preserving SVM (PP-SVM) training method using block chain-based encoded IoT data, to fill the void between ideal assumptions and practical restrictions. IoT messages are encrypted before being stored on a decentralized system because Block chain offers safe and dependable data exchange platforms across several data sources. Using a homomorphic cryptographic algorithm, Paillier, reliable modules have been developed, such as protected algebraic multiplying and protected comparison. Furthermore, a protected SVM learning algorithm that only needs two conversations during a single step has been created. According to stringent security assessment, proposed approach guarantees SVM model parameters for data professionals and secrecy of sensitive information for each data source. Extensive testing backs up effectiveness of the suggested plan.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnplanned outage in industry due to machine failures can lead to significant production losses and increased maintenance costs. Predictive maintenance methods use the data collected from IoT-enabled devices installed in working machines to detect incipient faults and prevent major failures. In this study, a predictive maintenance system based on machine learning algorithms, specifically AdaBoost, is presented to classify different types of machines stops in real-time with application in knitting machines. The data collected from the machines include machine speeds and steps, which were pre-processed and fed into the machine learning model to classify six types of machines stops: gate stop, feeder stop, needle stop, completed roll stop, idle stop, and lycra stop. The model is trained and optimized using a combination of hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to achieve an accuracy of 92% on the test set. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to accurately classify machine stops and enable timely maintenance actions; thereby, improving the overall efficiency and productivity of the textile industry.",

Real-time applications for remote health monitoring generate massive amounts of data in a short period. Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud systems, resulting in unprocessed and inadequate data for end-users. Since cloud technology is a dispersed intermediary layer between the edge network and the cloud infrastructure, the delay is significantly decreased, and reliable communications can be established using cloud computing on an IoT-enabled healthcare device. This study presents an Energy Efficient Healthcare Data Management Method (EE-HDMM), which enhances health monitoring using an IoT-assisted wearable sensor infrastructure. The difficulty of constrained sources and the energy consumption is minimized by proposing the optimum energy resource allocation method. Wearable sensor technology supported by cloud computing is the ideal and dependable platform for powerful life-critical systems that are unlikely to have communication delays. Compared to conventional techniques, the suggested EE-HDMM has a high precision rate of 97%, a sensitivity rate of 94%, and a system efficiency of 96%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a complex and diverse network consisting of resource-constrained sensors/devices/things that are vulnerable to various security threats, particularly Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. Recently, the integration of Software Defined Networking (SDN) with IoT has emerged as a promising approach for improving security and access control mechanisms. However, DDoS attacks continue to pose a significant threat to IoT networks, as they can be executed through botnet or zombie attacks. Machine learning-based security frameworks offer a viable solution to scrutinize the behavior of IoT devices and compile a profile that enables the decision-making process to maintain the integrity of the IoT environment. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to detect DDoS attacks in an SDN-WISE IoT controller. We have integrated a machine learning-based detection module into the controller and set up a testbed environment to simulate DDoS attack traffic generation. The traffic is captured by a logging mechanism added to the SDN-WISE controller, which writes network logs into a log file that is pre-processed and converted into a dataset. The machine learning DDoS detection module, integrated into the SDN-WISE controller, uses Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to classify SDN-IoT network packets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using different traffic simulation scenarios and compare the results generated by the machine learning DDoS detection module. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy rate of 97.4%, 96.1%, and 98.1% for NB, SVM, and DT, respectively. The attack detection module takes up to 30% usage of memory and CPU, and it saves about 70% memory while keeping the CPU free up to 70% to process the SD-IoT network traffic with an average throughput of 48 packets per second, achieving an accuracy of 97.2%. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in detecting DDoS attacks in an SDN-WISE IoT environment. The proposed approach can be used to enhance the security of IoT networks and mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks.",

This study showcases a first attempt to integrate these critical aspects into a fully automatic Internet of Thing (IoT)-based local landslide early warning system (Lo-LEWS).\nThe paper uses a validated hydrological numerical model, back-calculated over real monitored conditions, to evaluate the slope stability. The factor of safety (\n) was computed coupling the commercial package GeoStudio, using transient SEEP/W and Slope. The analyses were conducted for 5 different 1-year datasets encompassing both historical (2019â2020, 2021â2022, 2022â2023) and future projections (2064â2065, 2095â2096) of meteorological variables. Daily variation of hydrological and meteorological variables, along with vegetation indicators were used as inputs to train data-driven models, using polynomial regression (PR) and Random Forest (RF), to forecast daily\nvalues. The trained models proved to be effective and were employed to forecast slope stability for the rolling three days. To accurately forecast the\n, it was essential to incorporate forecasted hydrological, meteorological and vegetation variables into the analysis. The hydrological variables used as inputs for the data-driven models are forecasted using an open-source Python package for the analysis of hydrogeological time series, called Pastas (Collenteur et al., 2019). This model uses historical and forecasted meteorological and vegetation conditions to, specifically, replicate and forecast the time series of volumetric water content (VWC) and pore water pressure (PWP). The forecasted hydrological variables from Pastas, the forecasted meteorological variables as well as Leaf Area Index (\n) are used as inputs for the trained data-driven models to forecast the\nvalues.\nFinally, a web-based platform (WBP) has been created that automatically runs once a day and perform the following actions: 1) fetches measured and forecasted data using APIs, 2) runs rolling three days forecast based on collected hydrological, meteorological and vegetation variables, and 3) sends the forecasted values back to the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) data platform, NGI Live, making them available for real-time visualization in online dashboards. If\n, VWC or PWP threshold values are exceeded, text messages and emails are sent to the system managers, enabling them to take appropriate actions. The successful implementation of this framework is the result of a collaborative effort across diverse expertise areas, including geotechnics, hydrology, meteorology, instrumentation, and informatics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSystems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) are continuously growing in many areas such as smart cities, home environments, buildings, agriculture, industry, etc. Device mobility is one of the key aspects of these IoT systems, but managing it could be a challenge. Mobility exposes the IoT environment or Industrial IoT (IIoT) to situations such as packet loss, increased delay or jitter, dynamism in the network topology, new security threats, etc. In addition, there is no standard for mobility management for the most commonly used IoT protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP. Consequently, managing IoT mobility is a hard, error-prone and tedious task. However, increasing the abstraction level from which the IoT systems are designed helps to tackle the underlying technology complexity. In this regard, Model-driven development approaches can help to both reduce the IoT application time to market and tackle the technological complexity to develop IoT applications. In this paper, a Domain-Specific Language based on SimulateIoT is proposed for the design, code generation and simulation of IoT systems with mobility management for the MQTT protocol. The IoT systems generated integrate the sensors, actuators, fog nodes, cloud nodes and the architecture that supports mobility, which are deployed as microservices on Docker containers and composed suitability. Finally, two case studies focused on animal tracking and a Personal mobility device (PMD) based on bicycles IoT systems are presented to show the IoT solutions deployed.",

Radiation leakage detection devices must be installed in all nuclear power plants to ensure that avoidable catastrophes never occur again and that the loss of human life is prevented. A safe atmosphere for inhabitants and workers may be ensured by keeping a consistent radiation level in all applications that use radioactive material. Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor technology, or CMOS, uses complementary and symmetrical MOSFETS for logic-based functions in various applications, such as analog circuits (CMOS sensors). The Internet of Things (IoT) extends the power of the Internet beyond computing devices to a multitude of other things, processes, and environments. The main objective of this paper is to find a better and more creative solution for radioactive leakage detection techniques over present-day techniques. In this paper, the Authors aim to integrate CMOS and IOT applications for radioactive leakage detection methods on an industrial level. Within this paper, we have given brief descriptions of CMOS and IoT with their types, functions, methodology, and applications. CMOS is considered to be the most sophisticated and precise technology that can be employed to measure radiation leaks of all types (alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, and neutrons). With the help of IOT, massive disasters can be averted using complex alert systems. A well-coordinated combination of the two technologies has the potential to vastly increase leak detection potential and consistency. The study's major goal is to develop new and improved technology for detecting released radiation in the industry in order to obtain real-time information about the material leaked, as well as the location of the leak and the quantity of leakage that occurred, in order to reduce the danger of a natural catastrophe.",

The utilization of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) stack enhances the integration of web protocols and sensor networks, leading to greater accessibility. However, the BGP protocol stack introduces substantial overhead to messages transmitted at each layer, resulting in increased data overhead and energy consumption in networks by several orders of magnitude. This paper proposes a method to reduce the overhead on small and medium-sized packets. In multi-temporal networks utilizing BGP, scheduling and aggregating BGP packets at sensor nodes help achieve specific objectives. Various research methodologies and measures are employed to facilitate this, including request classification, BGP response prioritization within the network, determination of maximum acceptable delay, and overall network management. Synchronization and temporal integration of received messages at sensor nodes are performed, considering the maximum allowable delay for each message and the availability of the destination to process the accumulated messages. The evaluation results of the proposed method demonstrate a significant reduction in energy consumption and network traffic, particularly in monitoring applications within multi-stage networks. The protocol stack used is derived from the BGP standard.",

However, current approaches strive to infer the degree of abnormality of out-of-distribution samples when these appertain to different zero-day attacks. Inspired by the successes of the neural algorithmic reasoning paradigm to leverage the generalization of rule-based behavior, this paper presents a deep learning strategy for solving zero-day network attack detection and categorization. Moreover, focusing on the particular scenario of the Internet of Things (IoT), the privacy preservation requirement may imply a low training data regime for any learning algorithm. To this respect, the presented framework uses metric-based meta-learning to achieve few-shot learning capabilities. The presented pipeline is called NERO, as it imports the encode-process-decode architecture from the NEural algorithmic reasoning blueprint to converge zeRO-day attack detection policies within constrained training data.",

It addresses the challenges of developing and implementing a multi-parameter IoT-based occupancy monitoring system by integrating various off-the-shelf sensorsâCO2, infrared (IR), motion (PIR), and door status detectionâinto a cohesive system. Leveraging wireless LoRaWAN and novel cloud technologies, the system ensures easy installation, efficient maintenance, and robust data management. CO2-based occupancy detection models were trained using data from a reference office and validated in another office environment. Among the various models evaluated, the four best-performing onesâDecision Trees, Random Forest, LightGBM, and K-Nearest Neighborsâwere selected for integration into a multi-parameter detection system. To further enhance system performance and identify optimal sensor combinations and configurations for cost-effective and accurate occupancy detection, a data fusion methodology was employed. This methodology, validated with ground-truth data from a test bed, tested the monitoring system in different office settings, ranging from single to quadruple-occupant rooms. Integration of additional parameters into the developed data fusion approach significantly improved system performance, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 95% compared to 81% with a simple baseline data fusion method. This approach also reduced false detections during unoccupied periods, as tested in multiple rooms within the studied building, thereby enhancing the system's reliability for integration into occupancy-aware HVAC control strategies.",

However, the enormous number of networked devices renders these systems vulnerable to assaults. To address these challenges, researchers advocated reducing execution time, leveraging cryptographic protocols to improve security and avoid assaults, and utilizing energy-efficient algorithms to minimize energy consumption during computation. Nonetheless, these systems still struggle with long execution times, assaults, excessive energy usage, and inadequate security. We present a novel whale-based attribute encryption scheme (WbAES) that empowers the transmitter and receiver to encrypt and decrypt data using asymmetric master key encryption. The proposed WbAES employs attribute-based encryption (ABE) using whale optimization algorithm behaviour, which transforms plain data to ciphertexts and adjusts the whale fitness to generate a suitable master public and secret key, ensuring security against unauthorized access and manipulation. The proposed WbAES is evaluated using patient health record (PHR) datasets collected by IoT-based sensors, and various attack scenarios are established using Python libraries to validate the suggested framework. The simulation outcomes of the proposed system are compared to cutting-edge security algorithms and achieved finest performance in terms of reduced 11 s of execution time for 20 sensors, 0.121 mJ of energy consumption, 850 Kbps of throughput, 99.85 % of accuracy, and 0.19 ms of computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThis paper provided an improved network and dataset for in-apron aircraft engine keypoint detection.\nâ¢\nThis paper designed an efficient coordinate transformation algorithm within the airport apron.\nâ¢\nAircraft engine danger area incursion detection model based on keypoint detection was designed to enable advanced warning and alerting of intruding vehicles.\nAbstract\nOperational safety at airports has long been a subject of active research, with a growing focus on the safety of aircraft stands in recent years. The phase during which an aircraft taxi into its designated stand with engines still running poses safety risks to surrounding vehicles. However, there is currently a lack of effective methods for detecting potential conflicts and hazards during this taxiing phase. To address this issue, this study utilizes apron activity videos as a monitoring data source and introduces an integrated Internet of Things (IoT) conflict detection model. This system combines object detection, engine keypoint detection, coordinate conversion, and conflict warning system to provide timely alerts when vehicles incursion into the engine danger areas. Firstly, the paper streamlines the fourth-level branch and network of HRNet, resulting in the HRNet-3stage network. This network is then compared with Lite-HRNet to determine the optimal choice. Secondly, Recognizing the limitations of traditional video conflict detection based on pixel distance, a fixed monitoring camera coordinate conversion algorithm is designed to convert pixel coordinates into actual coordinates on the aircraft stand, thereby improving the accuracy of conflict detection based on distance measurement. Thirdly, considering the risks associated with engine inlet and exhaust, engine design parameters, static spacing standards, and the dynamic anti-collision process within the aircraft stand, the study proposes a method for classifying four types of aircraft engine danger areas. Corresponding conflict detection models are designed for potential scraping incidents when vehicles incursion into these danger areas. Upon detecting a vehicle entering the aircraft engine danger areas, the IoT system sends warning messages through the airport control tower monitoring system. Finally, we construct an apron sandbox to validate the conflict detection model. This validation results in an impressive F1-score exceeding 90% and a detection delay of less than 100â¯ms. Our innovative approach, supported by keypoint detection networks and IoT, effectively addresses the detection of critical aircraft components within stands. It comprehensively analyzes incursion issues into engine danger areas, offering a novel perspective for understanding and mitigating potential conflicts arising from aircraft taxiing into stands.",

These devices offer autonomous energy generation and sensing capabilities, by replacing conventional batteries in flexible wearables. Despite the substantial effort, however, achieving high output with optimal stability, durability, comfort, and washability poses substantial challenges, so we have yet to see any practical commercial uses of these materials. This study focuses on output and investigates the impacts of mono and bimetallic composite fabric electrode configurations on the output performance of F-TENGs. Our findings showcase the superiority of bimetallic configurations, particularly those incorporating Copper (Cu) with Nickel (Ni), over monometallic (Cu only) electrodes. These configurations demonstrate remarkable results, exhibiting a maximum instantaneous voltage, current, and power density of â¼ 199â¯V (a twofold increase compared to monometallic configurations), â¼22 Î¼A (a threefold increase compared to monometallic configurations), and 2992â¯mW/mÂ², respectively. Notably, these bimetallic configurations also exhibit exceptional flexibility, shape adaptability, structural integrity, washability, and mechanical stability. Furthermore, the integration of passive component-based power management circuits significantly enhances the performance capabilities of the F-TENGs, highlighting the essential role of power management circuits and electrode selection in optimizing F-TENGs. In addition, we have developed a complete IoT-enabled touch sensor system using CuNi-BEF EcoFlex layered F-TENGs for precise detection of soft and hard touches. This advanced system enhances robotic functionality, enabling nuanced touch understanding essential for precision tasks and fostering more intuitive human-machine interactions.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (229KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, achieving optimal detection performance through DNN training has posed challenges due to computational intensity and vulnerability to adversarial samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization method that combines regularization and simulated micro-batching. This approach enables the training of DNNs in a robust, efficient, and resource-friendly manner for IoT security monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DNN model, including its performance in Federated Learning (FL) settings, exhibits improved attack detection and resistance to adversarial perturbations compared to benchmark baseline models and conventional Machine Learning (ML) methods typically employed in IoT security monitoring. Notably, the proposed method achieves significant reductions of 79.54% and 21.91% in memory and time usage, respectively, when compared to the benchmark baseline in simulated virtual worker environments. Moreover, in realistic testbed scenarios, the proposed method reduces memory footprint by 6.05% and execution time by 15.84%, while maintaining accuracy levels that are superior or comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method for enhancing the efficiency and robustness of DNN-based IoT security monitoring.",

IoT is the collection of many linked devices due to their unique features, such as scalability, maintainability, fault tolerance, reliability, accuracy, and much more. With the growing number of hybrid devices in large organizations, security and privacy concerns are becoming more challenging. Security is essential for protecting the hardware, network aspects of devices, and information access from unauthorized entities. Most of the security methods and procedures provided by researchers are based on existing Internet security practices. The top-ranking authentication feature categories included the most compatible and common authentication feature for all types of IoT-based devices as an elementary security requirement for protection from unauthorized access. The future challenge is to address the incompatibility of the authentication feature with IoT devices based on appropriate technologies. AI and machine learning are also implementable in order to detect the vulnerability of IoT devices and inform the concerned operator or administration for protection. This research highlights the authentication feature of IoT devices from literature studies and evaluates the significant feature using COPRAS approach to assist organization in enhancing security of IoT devices.",

The new algorithm ensures the security of user data and the response efficiency of the model during the conversation process by integrating fully homomorphic encryption technology and dynamic sparse attention mechanism. The dynamic sparse attention mechanism introduced simultaneously improves the model's ability to handle long sequence data by dynamically adjusting attention weights. Experimental results showed that the precision of the proposed algorithm was 0.05 % higher than that of random algorithms and 0.19 % higher than that of sorting algorithms. The recall rate of the proposed algorithm was 0.14 % higher than that of random algorithms and 0.16 % higher than that of sorting algorithms. The research algorithm can identify objects with certain characteristics and is suitable for specific environments, greatly reducing the probability of data leakage in object search and providing new ideas for research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) platform allows physical devices to connect directly to the internet and upload data continuously. Insecure access makes IoT platforms vulnerable to different network intrusion attacks. As a result, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a core component of a modern IoT platform. However, traditional IDS often follows rule-based detection where the rules can be changed and exposed to the attacker and becomes weak over time. An efficient IDS also needs to be dynamic and effective in real time. This paper proposes a deep learning-based algorithm to protect the network against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, insecure data flow, and similar network intrusions. A system architecture is designed for a cloud-based IoT framework to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently. The performance evaluation using standard datasets demonstrates that the proposed model provides an accuracy of up to 99.99%.",

IoT devices are used for different purposes, such as security, remote monitoring, resource allocation, threats, ecosystems, and vulnerabilities. This paper proposed a deep learning algorithm-based solution to tighten the security level in the IoT-Smart environment network. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) considered in this paper is Network IDS, which investigates the manufacturer usage description, digital twins, and deep learning-based user behavior information. IoT devices' communication and the users in smart buildings are automatically connected in the Intelligent Communication system. Since many devices and users are interconnected in smart buildings, the probability of cyber-attack is high. Thus, better security is needed in smart buildings and smart environments. It should focus on securing IoT devices, users, and their communication. Hence, this paper developed a deep learning-based anomaly detection framework to dynamically monitor the issues and problems with MUD profiles and detect the anomaly behavior. The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) profiles, dynamic user behavior, IoT devices' traffic data the pattern of abnormal/anomaly traffic at the device level is predicted while traffic occurs. The MUD-ML-based model is implemented in Python software, verifying the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the escalation of industrial activities has significantly increased natural resource pollution, with air pollution becoming a major cause of diseases affecting living organisms. To address this critical environmental challenge, this study proposes a comprehensive air pollution monitoring system utilizing advanced technological instruments based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The systemâs primary objective is to provide precise, rapid, and efficient measurements, enabling detailed examinations of pollutant behaviors and facilitating data dissemination. The system includes a monitoring station equipped with sensors to measure ambient temperature, relative humidity, and concentrations of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), suspended particles (PM2.5, PM10), and ozone (O3). Additionally, it captures meteorological variables like wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation, allowing a nuanced analysis of their correlation with air pollutants. The collected data are transmitted via the Internet and visualized on a user-friendly platform accessible from any internet-enabled device. A protective case, designed with SolidWorks CAD software and fabricated using 3D printing, was validated through simulations for extreme conditions to ensures the systemâs robustness in tropical climates. The cost-effective, low-energy system offers a scalable solution for monitoring air pollution, advancing understanding of pollutant behaviors, and supporting environmental management.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (383KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe synergy of Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things in smart city camera-based surveillance offers notable advantages in resource allocation. Traditional approaches involving constant video data streaming to central servers incur significant bandwidth and storage costs. Our contribution involves proposing a cost-effective, lightweight Edge AI Enabled IoT Framework for Secure Smart Home Infrastructure, utilising a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and the open-source software motion for camera surveillance. The motion program monitors video signals from various cameras and triggers specific actions upon detecting movement. The framework efficiently notifies the smart home owner via email and smartphone message when motion is detected. We integrated four advanced motion detection and alert notification methodologies, conducting a thorough evaluation that positioned our framework as superior to existing solutions. Our research showcases impressive accuracy rates of 91% and 85% in indoor and outdoor scenarios, with minimal average delays of 12.8 seconds for email alerts and 1.6 seconds for messages which is approximately 41.6 % less than the state of the art methodologies. This innovative integration not only elevates surveillance capabilities but also establishes a swift and reliable alert system, contributing significantly to the efficiency and security of smart home environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study proposes the design and development of public light systems integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) applications for smart cities. Smart public lighting systems are designed using LED light sources in combination with a controller based on light intensity and motion sensors to control the brightness in working areas as per standard requirements. The control of smart public lighting systems is designed to operate in three modes: manual, scheduled, and auto modes, which are tested and compared in terms of lighting and power quality. Other functions of IoT, such as air pollution detection, security system-based video surveillance, and warning systems for flood disasters, are integrated into smart public lighting systems. A prototype of the designed smart public lighting system is presented in this paper. The parameters of average illuminance, overall uniformity, and threshold increment were implemented using DIALux software to optimise the luminaire spacing. The results showed that the goal of energy saving could be achieved using the auto mode. Although the automatic mode caused current harmonic distortion to the electrical grid, the harmonic value was less than the specified standard. Furthermore, the precision of IoT system operation was dependent on environmental variations and the reliability of wireless network technology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIoT is the technology that aids the interconnection of all kinds of devices over the internet to replace data, monitor devices and enhance actuators to create outcomes. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) contain control and computation components, which are compactly assured with physical procedures. The internet plays a prominent role in modern lives, and the cybersecurity challenge caused by phishing attacks is significant. This research presents a novel approach to address this problem using machine learning (ML) methods for phishing website classification. Leveraging feature extraction and innovative algorithms, the projected method aims to distinguish between malicious and legitimate websites by features of phishing attempts and analyzing inherent patterns. Phishing is a significant threat that causes extensive financial losses for internet users yearly. This fraudulent act includes identity hackers utilizing clever approaches to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive data. Generally, phishers use strategies such as advanced phishing software and fake emails to illegally acquire confidential details like usernames and passwords from financial accounts. This article develops an Explainable Artificial Intelligence with Aquila Optimization Algorithm in Web Phishing Classification (XAIAOA-WPC) approach on secure Cyber-Physical Systems. The developed XAIAOA-WPC approach mainly emphasizes the effectual classification and recognition of web phishing based on CPS. In the first phase, preprocessing is carried out on three levels: data cleaning, text preprocessing, and standardization. Furthermore, the Harris' Hawks optimization-based feature selection (HHO-FS) method is applied to derive feature subsets. The XAIAOA-WPC method utilizes a multi-head attention-based long short-term memory (MHA-LSTM) model for web phishing recognition. Besides, the detection outcomes of the MHA-LSTM approach are enhanced by using the Aquila optimization algorithm (AOA) model. At last, the XAIAOA-WPC method incorporates the XAI model LIME for superior perception and explainability of the black-box process for precise identification of intrusions. The simulation outcome of the XAIAOA-WPC method is examined on a benchmark database. The experimental validation of the XAIAOA-WPC method exhibited a superior accuracy value of 99.29â¯% over existing techniques.",

The main manufacturers of electronic devices are offering alternatives for the easy implementation of IoT projects by using low-cost development boards with advanced performance and information security features. The importance of maintaining privacy in data exchange has been considered by these manufacturers have added dedicated cryptographic modules that are compatible with the main cryptographic algorithms. The most significant problem with these modules is that albeit the use of cryptographic algorithms, there are information security weaknesses in hardware implementations to be considered. The purpose of this survey is to theoretically compare the characteristics of the development boards currently used for cryptographic applications in IoT systems. From a rigorous selection, seven of thirty-one possible development boards for IoT were selected and compared under two fundamental requirements: low-cost and cryptographic security mechanism offered. As a consequence of the study performed and the development boards analyzed in this work, it was possible to generate a guide for the selection of secure development boards for IoT applications.",

        "abstract": "Several unique characteristics of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as distributed deployment and limited storage, make it challenging for standard centralized access control systems to enable access control in todayâs large-scale IoT ecosystem. To solve these challenges, this study presents an IoT access control system called Ether-IoT based on the Ethereum Blockchain (BC) infrastructure with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Access Contract (AC), Cache Contract (CC), Device Contract (DC), and Policy Contract (PC) are the four central smart contracts (SCs) that are included in the proposed system. CC offers a way to save user characteristics in a local cache system to avoid delays during transactions between BC and IoT devices. AC is the fundamental program users typically need to run to build an access control technique. DC offers a means for storing the resource data created by devices and a method for querying that data. PC offers administrative settings to handle ABAC policies on usersâ behalf. Ether-IoT, combined with ABAC and the BC, enables IoT access control management that is decentralized, fine-grained and dynamically scalable. This research gives a real-world case study to illustrate the suggested frameworkâs implementation. In the end, a simulation experiment is performed to evaluate the systemâs performance. To ensure data integrity in dispersed systems, the results show that Ether-IoT can sustain high throughput in contexts with a large number of requests.",

Two studies were conducted, one with a Dutch student sample (N = 193) and one with a UK population sample (N = 278). Multiple labels were presented to participants to test potential effects of security degree (high vs. low), framing (positive vs. negative) and label type (grade format vs. informative format), in interaction with initial attitude towards smart devices and trust in the label, on purchase intention. Furthermore, we investigated the antecedents of trust in the label. Findings for both studies indicated significant positive effects of high security degree, positive framing, initial attitude and trust in the label on purchase intention. Both studies find that the positive effect of security degree on purchase intention was stronger when initial attitude was higher and when trust in the label was higher. The informative label was both more trusted and more preferred, so therefore recommended to be used. Overall, security information is effective in steering people towards purchasing safer IoT, and higher trust in the label increases the effectiveness of the label.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is prevalent in various areas and enables a variety of smart applications such as smart factory, smart home, and smart health. The IoT corresponds to a network of physical objects, fostering the collection and exchange of data over the Internet. Each physical object is equipped with sensors, actuators, and other technologies, and is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system. Business Process Management (BPM), in turn, is concerned with the modeling, execution, discovery, analysis, and monitoring of business processes. By enriching business processes with real-world IoT data and IoT-driven business rules, process automation as well as real-time process monitoring and decision making can be enhanced. Despite the increasing interest in IoT-enhanced business process support, IoT-driven business rules have not been well integrated with business process execution so far. In this context, providing integrated lifecycle support for IoT-driven business rules in BPM systems constitutes a challenge. This paper discusses how to integrate lifecycle support of IoT-driven business rules with BPM systems covering the modeling, execution, monitoring, analysis, and evolution of IoT-driven business rules. Furthermore, all lifecycle phases need to be covered by holistic approaches to IoT-driven business rules. For each lifecycle phase, we elaborate on the requirements emerging in this context and discuss existing approaches.",

With the pervasive availability of functionally equivalent IoT devices, they should be selected according to the specific deployment context in terms of user needs and conditions, device availability, and regulations when the operative context dynamic conditions can be set. Such selection is the objective of this work.\nMethods:\nWe rely on a conceptual framework for self-adaptation as the enabler for a run-time decision-making process. It allows for representing relations among IoT devices, the functionalities they deliver, and the different modalities these functionalities are provided with in terms of goals, devices, and norms. The framework is based on three fundamental principles: (1) high-level abstractions separating the expected functionality, how it can be delivered, and who is responsible for its delivery; (2) AAL applications as the run-time composition of atomic functionalities; (3) centrality of the user in the system.\nResult:\nThe Device-Goal-Norm framework is proposed to specify diagrams for different AAL applications, together with the semantics to transform these diagrams into run-time models. We also provide a running implementation of a run-time model based on the beliefâdesireâintention paradigm.",

This study tackles the essential challenge of safeguarding the IoMT ecosystem by implementing cutting-edge deep learning approaches for threat identification and avoidance.Our study begins by looking at a variety of cyber risks that the IoMT faces, including as backdoors, DDoS assaults, MITM assaults, ransomware and SQL injections.These hostile operations may impair medical services and jeopardize critical med- ical data.To combat these risks, we offer a strong intrusion detection system, that constantly monitors the IoMT architecture for any unusual activity.The findings of this research contribute significantly to the development of a secure and resilient medical IoT ecosystem.The performance metrics of the proposed intrusion detection system, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score, were evaluated for four different models: CNN, Autoencoder, Transformer Network, and LSTM Network.The LSTM Network ex- hibited exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 93%, recall of 96%, and an F1 Score of 94%.The compiled model, named Adam-LSTM, leverages the strengths of the Adam optimizer and LSTM architecture. Comparative anal- ysis with alternative algorithms demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach in accurately and efficiently identifying intrusions.The IoMT can supply dependable healthcare services to patients while preserving their sensitive medical information by proactively securing digital health through deep learning-based threat detection.This study provides the groundwork for future breakthroughs in medical IoT cybersecurity solutions and promotes the idea of a smarter and safer healthcare landscape.",

The nutrients from the fish waste are used by the plants to grow, and the plants filter the water for the fish. This process is self-sustaining and requires little human intervention. The monitoring and control of aquaponic systems is a complex task. In this research, the Internet of Things (IoT) is utilized to monitor and control the proposed system. In addition, a digital twin (DT) is deployed to digitize the physical system. The results explore that IoT and DT can improve aquaponic systems by collecting data about environmental conditions that is used to regulate plant growth, monitor fish health, optimize crop production, and optimize nutrient recycling. This decreased the need for and cost of human monitoring and improved the system's economics.",

Backscatter communication can resolve this problem, as backscatter communication is a data transmission in which an RF signal incident from the gateway is used for energy harvesting, and this energy will be employed for data transmission. In this paper, a hybrid contention-based TDMA scheme is proposed, which provides slots to devices by dividing them into groups, and then contention is employed in groups to acquire a slot; if a device is not able to transmit during harvest, then transmit (HTT) period, then it can transmit in variable sub frame and the devices which are not able to completely transmit during HTT period can reserve subframes. The proposed hybrid scheme is compared with the TDMA scheme for average transmission delay.The proposed scheme provides scalability. The difference between the average transmission delay of TDMA and the proposed hybrid scheme is from 6 to 20 s, depending on the number of devices added and when traffic is generated.",

Until now, fire investigations relied heavily on burn patterns and electrical artifacts to find possible starting locations, as well as witness statements and more recently witness imagery.\nAs Internet of Things (IoT) devices, often seen as connected smart devices, become more common, the various sensors embedded within them provide a novel source of traces about the environment and events within. They collect and store information in different locations, often not touched by the event, such as remote servers (cloud) or companion smartphones, widening the investigation field for fire incidents. This work presents two controlled fire incidents in apartments that we furnished, equipped with IoT devices, and subsequently burnt. We studied the traces retrievable from the objects themselves after the incident, the companion smartphone apps, and the cloud and assessed the value of the information they conveyed. This research highlighted the pertinence to consider traces from IoT devices in the forensic process of fire investigation.",

Chaos-based Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) play an essential role in enhancing the security of image encryption algorithms. This paper introduces a novel 1-dimensional cosine-modulated-polynomial chaotic map to be used as a PRNG in image encryption algorithms. The proposed map utilizes a cosine function to modulate the outcome of a polynomial expression, resulting in complex chaotic behaviour. The designed map acts as a self-modulating system and offers a larger chaotic range, reduced structural complexity, and enhanced chaotic properties, such as aperiodicity, unpredictability, ergodicity, and sensitivity to control parameters and initial conditions, in comparison to the traditional 1-dimensional chaotic maps. An extensive evaluation is performed to gauge the chaotic behaviour of the proposed map, including bifurcation diagrams, chaotic trajectory analysis, fixed point and stability analysis, Lyapunov Exponent, Kolmogorov Entropy and NIST SP800-22 tests demonstrating its effectiveness to be used as a secure PRNG in image encryption algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA cardiac arrhythmia poses a serious health risk to patients and can have serious consequences for their health. A clinical assessment of arrhythmia disorders could save a person's life. The Internet of Things (IoT) will revolutionize the healthcare sector by continuously monitoring cardiac arrhythmia diseases remotely and minimally invasively. We propose a frame-work that will facilitate the development of a practical diagnostic tool for the identification of cardiac arrhythmias in real-time in this work. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is processed using the Pan Tompkins QRS (Quantum Resonance System) detection method in order to extract the dynamic properties of the signal. The inter beat (RR) intervals are derived from an ECG signal in order to determine the characteristics of heart rate variability. The electrocardiogram is primarily used to identify irregular heartbeats (cardiac arrhythmias). Therefore, in our study, we evaluated other factors such as the heartbeat of the individual. As part of our IoT deployment, we are storing and analyzing data collected by the Pulse Sensor on the ThingSpeak IoT platform. The designed circuit's real-time collection of heartbeat and beats per minute values was uploaded to Thingspeak. Over the course of more than a week, we collected a variety of heart data. We propose Multi Channel Residual Network (MCHResNet) a deep-learning based solution that relies on multi-channel convolutions to detect both spatial and frequency features from electrocardiograms to facilitate the classification process. Based on the well-known Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital Arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database, we evaluate the proposed framework against MCH ResNet. Our IoT-based framework has been shown to be effective based on the results reported in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) represents a powerful new paradigm for connecting and communicating with the world around us. It has the potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with our surroundings. IoT devices are transmitting information over the Internet, most of them with different data formats, despite they may be communicating similar concepts. This often leads to data incompatibilities and makes it difficult to extract the knowledge underlying that data. Because of the heterogeneity of IoT devices and data, interoperability is a challenge, and efforts are underway to overcome this through research and standardization. While data collection and monitoring in IoT systems are becoming more prevalent, contextualizing the data and taking appropriate actions to address issues in the monitored environment is still an ongoing concern. Context Awareness is a highly relevant topic in IoT, as it aims to provide a deeper understanding of the data collected and enable more informed decision-making.\nIn this paper, we propose a semantic ontology designed to monitor global entities in the IoT. By leveraging semantic definitions, it enables end-users to model the entire process from detection to action, including context-aware rules for taking appropriate actions. The advantages of using semantic definitions include more accurate and consistent data interpretation, which improves the overall monitoring process and enables more effective decision-making based on the collected insights. Our proposal includes semantic models for defining the entities responsible for monitoring and executing actions, as well as the elements that need to be considered for an effective monitoring process. Additionally, we provide a new definition for the components known as gateways, which enable the connection and communication between devices and the Internet. Finally, we show the benefits of our ontology by applying it to a critical infrastructure domain where a rapid response is vital to prevent accidents and malfunction of the entities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the field of cognitive healthcare Internet of Things (CH-IoT), there is a strong demand for reliable and minimally intrusive smart gadgets that consistently acquire, analyse, and obtain the confidential health details of the individual. In fact, CH-IoT is empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) to transmute a fewer operational inputs into actionable, intelligent actions through the digitization of medical healthcare data. However, these systems consume more network complexity, interaction, and overhead costs, while inducing a blend of susceptibility and confidentiality issues. In support of this complexity, these cognitive systems need centralised data collection and to be gathered and analysed, which affects scalability issues and adds fuel to privacy and security breaches. Even though it possesses greater intricacy in its potential application, a substantial factor is maintaining the private preservation of healthcare data against the growing attacks. Thus, this paper presents a distributed privacy-preserving, chaotic encryption-based framework that can be deployed for CH-IoT systems to safeguard sensitive data against message modification, denial of service (DoS), and man-in-the-middle attacks (MIM), guaranteeing privacy and data integrity. The proposed framework integrated the federated learning layered hybrid chaotic encryption strategies by investigating through examination the learning infrastructure of convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the examination, the complete framework was carried out in the Tensorflow Federated Learning Libraries (FLL), and numerous performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, transmission efficiency, and overhead ratio were measured and contrasted with the various existing frameworks. For the intensive analysis, formal and informal security experiments were also conducted by NIST (National Institute of Science and Technology). The analytical results illustrate the importance of the proposed framework by achieving better security performance and outperforming the other existing models. Lastly, the proposed framework has more potential than the other existing frameworks and finds its place in real-time healthcare systems, but it needs to be improvised for real-time datasets.",

The fog computing layer is a distributed computing option that can handle some of these issues. However, fog computing devicesâ limited computing and power capabilities make it difficult to complete operations under time constraints while minimizing service latency and fog resource energy consumption in delay-sensitive IoT-Fog applications. This paper suggests a dynamic integer linear programming technique for facilitating optimal task offloading that distributes resources from the fog computing layer to IoT devices while considering the constraints on timely task execution and resource availability. The offloading challenge is modeled as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to ease the burden on finite fog resources and speed up the completion of time-sensitive operations. Given the large dimensionality of tasks in a dynamic environment, a task prioritization method is adopted to minimize tasksâ latency and the energy consumption of fog nodes. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach performs better than benchmark approaches regarding energy utilization and service latency. Overall, the proposed technique offers an efficient and practical response to the issues raised by IoT devices and fog computing while enhancing system efficiency regarding power consumption and latency.",

Thus, methods are necessary that enable the selection of target nodes while minimizing the number of data transmissions. The reduced amount of data transmitted during target node selection contributes to energy savings and prolongs the lifetime of battery-powered sensor nodes. This paper introduces a method for reducing data transmissions in sensor networks, where target nodes are selected to perform monitoring tasks. The proposed method allows the IoT gateway to determine when the sensor nodes should report their data readings. The gateway utilizes a prediction algorithm to determine whether a new target node should be selected. In this scheme, data are transmitted only when necessary for the correct selection of the target node. Experiments were conducted for a wireless sensor network consisting of mobile devices, where the target node is the device closest to a given location. The experimental evaluation confirmed that the proposed method significantly reduces the amount of transmitted data and ensures the proper selection of the target node. It was also demonstrated that the introduced approach reduces data transmissions more effectively than the state-of-the-art prediction-based algorithms. During the experiments, the amount of data transmitted from sensor nodes to the IoT gateway was analyzed. The proposed method has reduced the amount of transmissions by 94%, while the highest transmission reduction rate achieved by the existing techniques was 81.4%.",

In this study, nine machine learning techniques were validated to estimate the total nitrogen (TN) content in MD2 pineapple crops from data from multiple sources. These sources included multispectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); in situ sensors, which collected information on ecological factors such as pH, temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, wind speed and direction, as well as SPAD values indicating leaf chlorophyll content.\nTotal nitrogen (TN) values were taken from leaf tissue samples, which were then analyzed in a laboratory. To introduce nitrogen variability, a complete randomized block experimental design was implemented, applying five different treatments in five blocks, each with 12 replications, during a 6-month period in a pineapple crop located in Tauramena, Colombia. To address the inherent variability in the agricultural and environmental data, dimensionality was reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In addition, regularization techniques were applied, including cross-validation, feature selection, boost methods, L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, as well as hyperparameter optimization. These strategies generated more robust and accurate models, with the multilayer perceptron regressor (MLP regressor) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms standing out. On the first sampling date, XGBoost achieved an R2 of 86.98 %, being the highest. On the following dates, MLP achieved a R2 of 59.11 % on the second date; XGBoost achieved a R2 of 68.00 % on the third date, and on the last date, MLP achieved a R2 of 69.4 %. These results indicate that the integration of data from multiple sources and the use of machine learning models could greatly improve the precision of nitro-gen (N) diagnostics in pineapple crops, especially in real-time applications.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWe embarked on a comprehensive exploration of a single server queueing design, with a specific focus on handling soft failures. Soft failures refer to instances where customers do not need to be removed but rather need to wait for the server to be reactivated. These occurrences can happen at any time during the server's operation. When a soft failure occurs, the process automatically initiates a repair action, which we will refer to as the self-healing time. This self-healing time is relatively short, as the server possesses a remarkable restoration capability. Once the repair is complete, the server resumes its service provision and resumes normal operations. Moreover, during periods of prolonged idleness, the server can enter a dormant state, akin to a vacation mode. This dormant state is triggered when the server awaits the accumulation of N or more users. Once the threshold is reached, the server transitions into a busy state and resumes its normal operations. This study represents the pioneering integration of soft failures with the N policy, marking the first of its kind in this field. Additionally, we provide explicit expressions for the transient probabilities of the model, employing generating function methodology and Laplace transform techniques. Furthermore, we include performance measures and a numerical component to underscore the significance of the model's parameters.",

These technologies have triggered huge traffic and delay by continuously transmitting telemetry data to the cloud. IoT edge choice made decision-making closer to the environment, which decreases traffic and speeds up response time. Human activity recognition (HAR) systems, among other IoT applications, require systems with quick response time; reduce costs using constrained traffic to the cloud while maintaining accurate prediction results. This study proposes an application of HAR for predicting activities using up to three smartphone accelerometers. Three models are developed, trained, and deployed to achieve the necessary accuracy at the IoT edge and in the cloud, with an acceptable response time. Since each coordinate value from the three accelerometers has different importance in activity category prediction, focusing on the data from the most related values can help minimize the amount of information transferred from the edge to the cloud. Six models were trained in the cloud; three were deployed and tested at the edge with different features by selecting the most important ones using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Different experiments showed that traffic and processing time decreased significantly based on the time required to predict HAR categories with acceptable accuracy. Since there is significant latency between the edge and the cloud and within the cloud, sending samples for verification save bandwidth, and processing requests locally at the edge speed up predictions. Results illustrate that the time required to serve one request from the environment where smartphones generate traffic through the internet connection to the cloud took about 5.8 s on average, including transmission delays and the prediction process. During this time, the model at the edge can serve 150 requests with the same accuracy using nine features. In addition, the edge can serve 286 requests in 5.8 s with 94.8 % accuracy when choosing the top four features at the edge.",

If the data sent by the device is not trustworthy, it will lead to incorrect health decisions and recommendations. In this paper, we propose a trust computational model for provisioning trusted data to the health index evaluation system (HIES). This HIES uses the trusted data selected by the trust model to calculate the health index (e.g., circadian health index) of a particular user. The objective of the proposed work is to provide a trustworthy system for better circadian health decision making by determining the trustworthiness of the data provided by health IoT devices. Unlike existing trust management protocols, our trust model considers identity-based schema such as device identity and user identity, device health, user feedback, data consensus, and acceptance rate for trustworthy data selection. Our trust computational model is resistant to malicious devices with false identities and identifies the devices that report false data. We present the performance analysis of our trusted data selection model and compare it to the baseline scheme.",

This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption of autonomous decision-making systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where the aim is to amplify productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain, mushrooms have concurrently emerged as a significant component of daily diets, offering additional vitamins and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating mushrooms in open environments poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, prompting numerous research efforts. Recognizing the inconsistencies in existing approaches to safeguard vital parameters in mushroom farms, this paper introduces an innovative system utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time records are managed based on the fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture essential data for decision-making in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic, the system addresses pivotal aspects such as substrate watering, environmental control, light management, and pest detection. Through experimental results, it becomes evident that the proposed system not only exemplifies the potential of IoT technologies in agriculture but also offers a comprehensive and efficient approach to real-time decision-making. By aggregating sensor data, the system proves instrumental in enhancing the quality and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing a promising trajectory for sustainable and technologically driven agricultural practices.",

The process converts everyday manual activities into automatic actions, such as turning on lights upon entering a room, activating air conditioning on hot days, and switching off a television when there are no viewers. This article addresses a case study on context-aware monitoring conducted at the Laboratory of Distributed Systems and Concurrent Programming (LaSDPC) of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. The focus is on a Fog layer of the IoT operating closer to sensors and reducing communication delays. Concepts of context-aware systems, multi-agent systems, ontology, and MQTT protocol were considered for the implementation of the intelligent system on-site. The programming languages used were Java and Python, leveraging libraries and frameworks dedicated to such technologies. A scalable system that does not compromise computational resource use and maintains responsiveness with low data exchange latency is proposed and tests checked the intelligent behavior of the laboratory under specific conditions using temperature, luminosity, and presence of a person as parameters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIntegrating sharded blockchain with IoT presents a solution for trust issues and optimized data flow. Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its nodes into parallel shards, yet it is vulnerable to the 1% attacks where dishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing security with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional optimization. This paper introduces a Trust-based and DRL-driven (TbDd) framework, crafted to counter collusion attack risks and dynamically adjust node allocation, enhancing throughput while maintaining network security. With a comprehensive trust evaluation mechanism, TbDd discerns node types and performs targeted resharding against potential threats. The TbDd framework maximizes the tolerance for dishonest nodes, optimizes node movement frequency, ensures even node distribution in shards, and balances sharding risks. Extensive evaluations validate TbDdâs superiority over conventional random-, community-, and trust-based sharding methods in shard risk equilibrium and reducing cross-shard transactions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, attacks against various Internet-of-Things systems, networks, servers, devices, and applications witnessed a sharp increase, especially with the presence of 35.82 billion IoT devices since 2021; a number that could reach up to 75.44 billion by 2025. As a result, security-related attacks against the IoT domain are expected to increase further and their impact risks to seriously affect the underlying IoT systems, networks, devices, and applications. The adoption of standard security (counter) measures is not always effective, especially with the presence of resource-constrained IoT devices. Hence, there is a need to conduct penetration testing at the level of IoT systems. However, the main issue is the fact that IoT consists of a large variety of IoT devices, firmware, hardware, software, application/web-servers, networks, and communication protocols. Therefore, to reduce the effect of these attacks on IoT systems, periodic penetration testing and ethical hacking simulations are highly recommended at different levels (end-devices, infrastructure, and users) for IoT, and can be considered as a suitable solution. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to explain, analyze and assess both technical and non-technical aspects of security vulnerabilities within IoT systems via ethical hacking methods and tools. This would offer practical security solutions that can be adopted based on the assessed risks. This process can be considered as a simulated attack(s) with the goal of identifying any exploitable vulnerability or/and a security gap in any IoT entity (end devices, gateway, or servers) or firmware.",

In response to the escalating challenges of theft and aggressive activities plaguing agricultural farms in Bangladesh, this research presents an innovative IoT-based smart agro-farm security system. Through comprehensive system design, program development, and testing, the system detects unauthorised access and triggers alarms, sending real-time notifications to the farmer's house and mobile device. The system consists of a sender station (farm shed) and two receiver stations (farmer's house and mobile device). The sender station integrates a range of sensors (laser and vibration sensors), including GSM and a transceiver controlled by an Arduino Mega. The receiver stations comprise an Arduino UNO, indicator lights, high-sound alarms, and remote access on the farmer's mobile device. Testing showed 100% responsiveness for the laser sensor and 90% for the vibration sensor. This system went through a rigorous process of testing which resulted in an overall system efficiency of 90%. This innovative solution empowers farmers and agro-farm entrepreneurs to protect their valuable assets, contributing to enhanced farm security in Bangladesh and promoting agricultural industry sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBody Area Sensor Network (BASN) communication methods meet clients' multi-level requirements through Wearable Internet of Things (WIoT) systems. Transparency at management levels, heterogeneous support, and distributed communication to users are requirements of the PCS. Providing essential functions is a serious problem. A flexible Ubiquitous Computing (UC) architecture presented in this study is used to improve the reliability of end-user communication in the WIoT-based health sensor approach. According to this method, demand and sharing variables provide the foundation for the evaluation of resource allocation through recurrent learning. A proposed method could be used to implement end-user mobility management on WIoT healthcare sensors for data transmission, resource allocation and sharing. To show the integrity of the approach, some parameters were used in the actual evaluation and performance predictions. In the ubiquitous ecosystem, the uninterrupted flow was guaranteed to reduce the likelihood of a request being blocked. Memory control to density assignment at the framework level through storage management helps reduce backlogs and failures when allocating resources. The proposed approach enhances storage utilization, bandwidth, and request management besides lowering connection speed, backlogs, and request failure compared to the existing systems.",

Over the next years, density and frequency of measurements will increase to generate more insights and get a more solid basis for decisions, including through redundant low-cost sensor deployments. The resulting data characteristics lead to large-scale system design in which small input data errors may lead to severe cascading problems including ultimately wrong decisions. To ensure internal data consistency to mitigate this risk in such IoT environments, fast-paced data fusion and consensus among redundant measurements need to be achieved. In this context, we introduce history-aware sensor fusion powered by accurate voting with clustering as a promising approach to achieve fast and informed consensus, which can converge to the output up to 4X faster than the state of the art history-based voting. Leveraging three case studies, we investigate different voting schemes and show how this approach can improve data accuracy by up to 30% and performance by up to 12% compared to state-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches. We furthermore contribute a specification format for easily deploying our methods in practice and use it to develop a pilot implementation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices can reduce their energy consumption by computation offloading. However, IoT devices located in areas without deployed ground communication facilities face significant challenges in computation offloading. For this reason, we propose the space-air-terrestrial integrated networks (SATINs) and design a three-tier computing framework for providing computing services to IoT devices. In the computing framework, device's task can be computed locally, on mobile edge computing (MEC) servers in the air layer, or on cloud servers in the ground. In this article, we jointly optimize the computation offloading decisions of tasks and computing resource allocation of MEC servers. We aim at minimizing the total cost of executing tasks while satisfying both the time constraints of tasks and capacity constraints of MEC servers. And the total cost includes the energy cost of IoT devices and the usage cost of servers. Since the computation offloading decisions are binary variables, the joint optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and is NP-hard. To tackle this problem, we use relaxation technique and Majorize-minimize (MM) method to transform the optimization problem into a series of convex problems for solving. Moreover, we propose a distributed algorithm based on Lagrange dual decomposition method with low time complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed distributed algorithm can effectively reduce the total cost of the system compared with other benchmark algorithms.",

This hybridized approach aims to optimize energy consumption efficiency while ensuring comprehensive network coverage for sensor deployment. The formulation of the network strategy is rooted in empirical data collected from real sensors deployed across two neighboring municipalities within the State of EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil. Specifically, our analysis encompasses 380 strategically positioned sensors throughout VitÃ³ria city, all intended for connectivity to a central gateway located in Vila Velha. To establish mesh network clusters, we employed the k-Medoids algorithm for clustering fusion, while the GA with a binary solution was utilized to determine the star network points. In this approach, Dijkstra and genetic algorithms with real solutions are incorporated to facilitate efficient resource allocation within the mesh (utilizing ZigBee) and star (utilizing LoRa) networks. These resource allocation strategies are devised with the overarching objective of minimizing energy consumption. The findings of this investigation demonstrate that through the implementation of planning and resource allocation algorithms, we were able to effectively reduce the number of mesh networks and allocate resources to each designated end-point sensor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe increasing number of vehicles on the road has made traffic regulations challenging to manage, particularly in large and crowded cities. Real-time traffic monitoring systems are one of the most important factors that enable efficient traffic flow and enhanced mobility. Therefore, vehicles and drivers have always needed reliable and accurate real-time traffic information. Recently, various solutions have been proposed to solve the problems and concerns in traffic situations. One alternative solution is vehicular cloud computing (VCC). Additionally, an IoT-aided robotic (IoRT) model has been developed with a modern architecture that integrates IoT sensor nodes and cameras to gather real-time traffic data. The main contributions of this research work are to implement two deep learning techniques based on modified LeNet-5 for real-time traffic sign recognition and the transfer learning-based Inception-V3 model for detecting and recognizing traffic lights. Furthermore, optimal distance was found between the ultrasonic sensors and the obstacles using ultrasonicsâ waves time and speed to reduce road accidents. The data, which is collected by sensors and cameras, is processed using various image processing algorithms and it is sent to the cloud to be available for drivers and commuters through a mobile application. Test results indicate that the proposed models have significant improvements in terms of accuracy. The modified LeNet-5 achieved accuracy rates of 99.12% and 99.78% on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and extended GTSRB (EGTSRB) datasets, respectively, whereas the second model, trained on Laboratory for the Intelligent and Safe Automobiles (LISA) dataset, attained a 98.6% accuracy rate. Compared to the related traffic monitoring systems, the findings of this study outperform other works by 3.78% for traffic sign recognition and by 1.02% for traffic light detection and recognition.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things promotes a view of large-scale deployments of devices able to compute, communicate, and interact with their surrounding environment. In this context, one significant challenge revolves around designing and programming collective processes, i.e., durable activities involving the collaboration of large groups of devices. Examples of collective processes include distributed sensing, collective decision-making, collective movement/transport, and adaptive maintenance of system-level structures. To address the issues involved in developing such kinds of system-wide behaviours, research has proposed multiple approaches, abstractions, and algorithmic solutions. In particular, the approach of aggregate processes has emerged as a promising formal technique for programming collective processes by a macro-level perspective while supporting decentralisation, abstraction, and resilience. In order to characterise (i) previous work on aggregate processes, (ii) the usages and applications that this technique may foster, and (iii) draw general design insights in the realm of collective computing, this article provides a characterisation of common problems and solutions based on aggregate processes. What results is a catalogue of design patterns for decentralised collective processes. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of patterns, describe each pattern in a schematic form, and discuss the implications for the design of collective processes for the Internet of Things and related scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nManual water curing is a widespread practice, yet achieving proper curing to prevent plastic cracking and ensure long-term strength and durability poses a difficulty. Aside from being labor-intensive, manual water curing is also uneconomical and has negative effects on aesthetics. As an alternative, certain researchers suggest an automated curing method that estimates water loss and replenishes it using a theory-based calculation and taking into account the weather conditions. However, their effectiveness is restricted as the estimated water loss may not be completely accurate due to several factors that impact it. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual automated water curing system that utilizes real-time monitoring with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system involves wireless sensors for temperature and relative humidity, a smart water valve, water sprinklers, and an IoT gateway. As per ASTM F2170, the sensors can be positioned, and data will be collected, examined, and handled in real-time using an IoT gateway. The IoT gateway transmits data to the smart water valve, which then sprays water when the moisture level drops below the preset threshold. This process continues until the concrete reaches a certain strength level estimated using internal concrete temperature data and the Maturity method. Moreover, the data can be transmitted continuously to cloud storage to keep track of the concrete's durability. The proposed automated water curing system offers numerous advantages, such as eliminating the risk of concrete failure caused by inadequate curing, being efficient in terms of time and resources, monitoring real-time strength development, not being impacted by other factors, and having practical benefits for both stakeholders and society.",

Nowadays, HTTP is used in three major versions, each introducing significant changes with respect to the previous one. We evaluated the energy consumption of the major versions of the HTTP protocol when used in the communication between energy-constrained devices and cloud-based or edge-based services. Experimental results show that in a machine-to-machine communication scenario, for the considered client devices â a smartphone and a Single Board Computer â and for a number of cloud/edge services and facilities, HTTP/3 frequently requires more energy than the previous versions of the protocol. The focus of our analysis is on machine-to-machine communication, but to obtain a broader view we also considered a clientâserver interaction pattern that is more browsing-like. In this case, HTTP/3 can be more energy efficient than the other versions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we propose an effective target localization strategy for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, where positioning is performed by resource-constrained devices. Target-anchor links may be impaired by Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) communication conditions. In order to derive a feasible IoT-oriented positioning strategy, we rely on the acquisition, at the target, of a sequence of consecutive measurements of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the wireless signals transmitted by the anchors. We then consider a pragmatic approach according to which the NLOS channels are pre-mitigated and âtransformedâ into equivalent Line-Of-Sight (LOS) channels to estimate more accurately each target-anchor distance. The estimated distances feed âagnosticâ localization algorithms, operating as if all links were LOS. We experimentally assess the performance of our approach in indoor (IEEE 802.11-based) and outdoor (Long Term Evolution, LTE-based) scenarios, considering both geometric and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based localization algorithms. Even if NLOS mitigation per single communication link is very effective, our results show that, in a given environment, it is possible to derive an âaverageâ NLOS mitigation strategy regardless of the specific position of the target in the given environment. This is crucial to limit the computational complexity at IoT nodes performing localization, yet guaranteeing a relatively high (for IoT scenarios) localization accuracy, especially in an IEEE 802.11-based indoor case (with six anchors). The obtained performance compares favorably (in relative terms) with that obtained with more sophisticated wireless technologies (e.g., Ultra-WideBand, UWB).",

This study aims to explore the factors and extent to which IoT technologies affect travellers' SWB during short-term trips. To this end, an integrated model was developed. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from a sample of 1028 British and 970 Chinese short-term travellers. A multigroup analysis has been conducted using Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) with Amos 26.0 software. The results reveal TTF has a positive indirect effect on consumers' SWB via perceived benefits in both groups and a positive direct impact in the case of the British group. However, no significant relationship was observed between TTF and travellers' SWB in the case of the Chinese group. Theoretically, this study first empirically explores and advances our knowledge of how the SWB of short-term travellers is affected by the use of IoT technologies across countries.

One of the significant contributors to maize crop yield loss is the Northern Leaf Blight (NLB), which traditionally takes 14â21 days to visually manifest on maize. This study introduces a novel approach for detecting NLB as early as 4â5 days using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which can identify the disease before any visual symptoms appear. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, nonvisual measurements of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and ultrasound emissions from maize plants were captured and analyzed. A controlled experiment was conducted on four maize varieties, and the data obtained were used to develop and validate a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for VOC classification and an LSTM model for ultrasound anomaly detection. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model, enhanced with wavelet data preprocessing, achieved an F1 score of 0.96 and an Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 1.00. In contrast, the LSTM model exhibited an impressive 99.98% accuracy in identifying anomalies in ultrasound emissions. Our findings underscore the potential of IoT sensors in early disease detection, paving the way for innovative disease prevention strategies in agriculture. Future work will focus on optimizing the models for IoT device deployment, incorporating chatbot technology, and more sensor data will be incorporated for improved accuracy and evaluation of the models in a field environment.",

On the other side, current AI deployment platforms focus on the provision and reuse of machine learning models through containers that can be wired together to build new applications. The challenge is that composition mechanisms of the AI platforms, albeit effective due to their simplicity, are in fact too simplistic to support cognitive IoT applications, in which sensor devices also benefit from the machine learning results. Our objective is to perform a gap analysis between the requirements of cognitive IoT applications on the one side and the current functionalities of AI deployment platforms on the other side. In this work, we provide an overview of the paradigms in AI deployment platforms and the requirements of cognitive IoT applications. We study a use case for person counting in a skiing area through camera sensors, and how this use case benefits from letting the IoT sensors have access to operational knowledge in the form of visual attention models. We describe the implementation of the IoT application using an AI deployment platform, analyze its shortcomings, and necessary workarounds. From the use case, we identify and generalize five gaps that limit the usage of deployment platforms: the transparent management of multiple instances of components, a more seamless integration with IoT devices, explicit definition of data flow triggers, and the availability of templates for cognitive IoT architectures and reuse below the top-level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLow-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) are a type of wireless communication technologies that enable efficient data transfer between low-power devices. This article explores the challenges of ensuring security in LPWANs and proposes a solution that combines two key mechanisms: Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) and Static Context Header Compression (SCHC). LPWANs are increasingly being used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, but the features that endow these technologies with low power consumption and long range also make it necessary to adapt protocols and innovate in the approaches to achieve security while maintaining communications viable in technologies like these, in some cases with severe limitations. OSCORE provides end-to-end security for constrained devices, while SCHC enables efficient IP-based transmission over LPWANs. By combining these two protocols, the proposed solution aims to address the security and efficiency challenges of LPWANs, ensuring that IoT devices and data are protected from unauthorized access and manipulation. The article also presents experimental results demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach using a real-life scenario, with industrial-grade hardware. The study concludes that the use of OSCORE and SCHC in LPWAN networks can significantly enhance the security and privacy of IoT devices.",

While existing centralized data marketplaces facilitate data trading, they are often marred by trust issues, a single point of failure, and significant security and privacy vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical shortcomings, this paper introduces a blockchain-based industrial data trading system that not only ensures secure and transparent data trading but also offers advantages over conventional systems. Unlike traditional marketplaces, our proposed system emphasizes trustworthiness by mitigating third-party risks, enhancing data integrity through decentralized storage, and employing graph technology for efficient blockchain querying. Further, with integrated access control, our system elevates security standards. Preliminary evaluations reveal the systemâs potential to offer a more secure, transparent, auditable, and trustworthy data trading environment, distinctly outpacing the capabilities of current marketplaces.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a conformal, miniaturized, and geometrically simple monopole antenna designed for VehicleâtoâEverything (V2X) communications. The antenna consists of a flexible substrate, radiating patch, ground, and metallic stubs. Meandered lines are added to the U-shaped radiator to achieve the required bandwidth of the antenna. The antenna has |S11|< â10 dB magnitude from 5.06 to 7.24 GHz, attaining a peak low magnitude ofâ68 dB. The antenna is configured into a 4-port MultipleâInputâMultipleâOutput (MIMO) setup to minimize the mutual coupling between its elements. The proposed flexible MIMO antenna offers bandwidth from 5.37 to 7.34 GHz and a peak moderate gain of 4.63 dBi with omnidirectional stable radiation patterns. To improve the mutual coupling, two hollow concentric circular structures, in combination with a pair of stub networks are integrated between the elements of the MIMO system. The transmission coefficient and surface current analysis confirm the effectiveness of the decoupling structure. The presented MIMO antenna is characterized by high isolation, a low envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), and high diversity gain, suitable for V2X MIMO communication scenarios.",

An associated mobile app is often provided for more convenient usage of these capabilities. The perceived quality of these companion apps can impact the success of the IoT product. We investigate the perceived quality and prominent issues of smart-home IoT mobile companion apps with the aim of deriving insights to: (i) provide guidance to end users interested in adopting IoT products; (ii) inform companion app developers and IoT producers about characteristics frequently criticized by users; (iii) highlight open research directions. We employ a mixed-methods approach, analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. We assess the perceived quality of companion apps by quantitatively analyzing the star rating and the sentiment of 1,347,799 Android and 48,498 iOS user reviews. We identify the prominent issues that afflict companion apps by performing a qualitative manual analysis of 1,000 sampled reviews. Our analysis shows that usersâ judgment has not improved over the years. A variety of functional and non-functional issues persist, such as difficulties in pairing with the device, software flakiness, poor user interfaces, and presence of issues of a socio-technical impact. Our study highlights several aspects of companion apps that require improvement in order to meet user expectations and identifies future directions.",

Based on the integration of IoT sensors and deep learning algorithms, this study proposes the development of intelligent monitoring systems for maternal and foetal signals in high-risk pregnancies. IoT sensors collect maternal clinical data, such as temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation level, heart rate, and fetal heart rate and store them on the cloud for monitoring and prediction purposes. Furthermore, a novel Optimized single-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-OCNN) is proposed for better classification and prediction of the different emergencies of both mother and fetus. The IoT systems have been designed based on the multiple sensors interfaced with the MICOT boards (Node MCU+MCP3008) and cloud mechanism. Nearly 9000 data were collected and used for the evaluation. The extensive experimentation is carried out using cloud-centric learning algorithms such as K-Nearest neighborhood (KNN), Random forest(RF), Support vector machines(SVM), Convolutional neural networks(CNN) and Extreme learning machines (ELM) and various parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, and F1-score are calculated. The evaluation shows that the proposed classifier has outperformed the other learning algorithms regarding accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Based on the above results, the suggested system is a practical and efficient alternative for maternal and fetal monitoring using IoT and artificial intelligence.",

Therefore, we consider it critical to manage UX and its link to business value quantitatively. Key performance indicators (KPIs) have been widely adopted for objectively measuring factors that influence business success, including measuring UX characteristics and their business contribution in the context of software systems in general. Yet, measuring UX in the context of complex Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems, remains a challenge.\nThis paper presents a multivocal literature review (MLR) of the UX-KPIs proposed in the context of (I)IoT systems, along with factors influencing UX and challenges of quantifying UX. We investigate the status quo and derive recommendations for measuring the UX of (I)IoT systems.\nOur analysis of 64 publications shows that UX has so far received relatively little attention in the context of (I)IoT. Although we identified 605 KPIs, 78 influencing factors, and 119 challenges, most of the UX features discussed were defined in a broader context of software systems, i.e., they were less specific to IoT, but rather focused on universal system quality characteristics such as functional suitability, performance efficiency, usability, and reliability.\nFinally, no generally accepted approach for measuring UX in (I)IoT systems and how these contribute to the overall business value has been proposed yet. We also found little evidence that improving UX or achieving a good UX currently plays an explicit role in the design and development of IoT systems.",

Precisely assessing water contamination levels is crucial for effective monitoring and safeguarding aquatic life within the aquaculture industry. Traditional methods for evaluating water contamination are characterized by their costliness, time-consuming nature, and susceptibility to errors. Integrating computer technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Data Analytics offers promising potential in addressing this issue. Nevertheless, current deep learning solutions have limitations related to data variability, interpretability, and performance. To address these limitations, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that incorporates IoT-based data collection and data segregation techniques to enhance the accuracy of water contamination classification in aquaculture. Real-time data collected through IoT devices, encompassing parameters like temperature, pH levels, dissolved oxygen, nitrate concentration, and other water quality indicators, enables a holistic evaluation of water quality. By considering predefined acceptable ranges for aquatic life, this framework calculates a water contamination index, facilitating the classification of data into categories such as contaminated and non-contaminated. To ensure robust classification, the study introduces an innovative attention-based model known as the Ordinary Differential Equation Gated Recurrent Unit (AODEGRU). This attention mechanism directs the model's focus towards salient features associated with water contamination, while the AODEGRU architecture captures temporal patterns within the data. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed model. It demonstrates its superiority with high performance, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 98.69% on a publicly available dataset and an impressive 99.89% accuracy on a real-time dataset, clearly outperforming existing methodologies.",

While initially designed to support the transport of Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 3 (HTTP/3) messages, QUIC can also be employed for various applications. This paper explores the effective utilization of the QUIC protocol for transporting Internet of Things (IoT) messages. Specifically, we propose a proxy-based scheme that leverages the multi-streaming features of QUIC to deliver Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) messages. In the proposed scheme, multiple CoAP connections between IoT clients and a server are aggregated using client proxy and server proxy. Each CoAP connection is mapped onto a designated QUIC stream. It is noted that this proxy-based approach can be implemented without requiring modifications to existing CoAP applications at the client and server sides. Furthermore, we introduce a compressed mapping scheme from CoAP messages to QUIC streams to enhance performance within the proxy-based model. In testbed experimentation, the proposed QUIC-based CoAP transport scheme is compared with the existing UDP-based and TCP-based CoAP schemes in a variety of IoT network environment. From the experimentation results, we see that the proposed QUIC-based scheme can achieve 80% reduction in round-trip time and 9% increase in fast response rate, compared to the other candidate schemes. We can also see that the CoAP over QUIC scheme with compression provides a 10% performance gain over the case without compression.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is a growing trend of cyberattacks against Internet of Things (IoT) devices; moreover, the sophistication and motivation of those attacks is increasing. The vast scale of IoT, diverse hardware and software, and being typically placed in uncontrolled environments make traditional IT security mechanisms such as signature-based intrusion detection and prevention systems challenging to integrate. They also struggle to cope with the rapidly evolving IoT threat landscape due to long delays between the analysis and publication of the detection rules. Machine learning methods have shown faster response to emerging threats; however, model training architectures like cloud or edge computing face multiple drawbacks in IoT settings, including network overhead and data isolation arising from the large scale and heterogeneity that characterizes these networks.\nThis work presents an architecture for training unsupervised models for network intrusion detection in large, distributed IoT and Industrial IoT (IIoT) deployments. We leverage Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train between peers and reduce isolation and network overhead problems. We build upon it to include an unsupervised device clustering algorithm fully integrated into the FL pipeline to address the heterogeneity issues that arise in FL settings. The architecture is implemented and evaluated using a testbed that includes various emulated IoT/IIoT devices and attackers interacting in a complex network topology comprising 100 emulated devices, 30 switches and 10 routers. The anomaly detection models are evaluated on real attacks performed by the testbedâs threat actors, including the entire Mirai malware lifecycle, an additional botnet based on the Merlin command and control server and other red-teaming tools performing scanning activities and multiple attacks targeting the emulated devices.",

Many different types of smart irrigation system can be used, but there is no scientific consensus about which type is the finest. The purpose of this study was to compare various irrigation methods: an IoT-based soil moisture monitoring (IoT-SM) method using moisture sensors and an ETâbased strategy. The best irrigation scheduling strategy should be determined by commercial production: keeping the soil water content near field capacity will result in a better fresh yield but not a more dry matter. Sweet corn was chosen as the crop under study. Growth characteristics (plant height, yield, and water productivity) were compared for each of the two approaches. For IoT based soil moisture monitoring method, two irrigation regimes were used: 43.5 per cent and 34.8 per cent (as field capacity (FC) of soil and 80% of FC, respectively) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc 100 per cent) for the ET-based method. The results showed that the IoT-SM 43.5 per cent could produce higher yields of about 12.05% and water savings by 11% compared to the ETc 100 per cent-based irrigation method. The developed IoT system was durable and water-resistant, allowing it to be deployed in outdoor agriculture. At the same time, a solar power supply eliminates the need for cabling and reduces sensor node maintenance.\nGraphical abstract\nOverall architecture of IoT based smart drip irrigation system.\nDownload: Download high-res image (251KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCloud-based IoT is a platform that connects smart devices to the cloud for real-time data analysis. Any device on the IoT platform can connect to the cloud through messaging. The integrated publish/subscribe and push/pull methods for a cloud-based IoT framework that is scalable for connecting IoT devices and processing the real-time data are proposed. The proposed framework uses a publish/subscribe messaging broker and a push-pull method for transmitting the data from the device to the cloud. The IoT devices publish the data via the broker, to which the cloud service providers subscribe. This publishing and transferring of data from the broker to the cloud is implemented with the help of a push-pull mechanism. In this mechanism, the broker makes the computations required to select the cloud service provider. Hence, the overhead of the device is reduced. All computations go in parallel, which reduces the latency of the system. The system is flexible for any number of devices, brokers, and cloud service providers, which shows that the system is scalable. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the model, which was developed using a cloud-based IoT framework with a focus on scalability and latency.",

Breast cancer (BC) represents the most highly infiltrative neoplasms and constitutes the primary cause of mortality in the female population due to cancer-related complications. Consequently, the imperative for early detection and prognosis has emerged as a means to enhance long-term survival rates and mitigate mortality. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are being utilized to aid radiologists in the analysis of medical images, resulting in enhanced outcomes for individuals diagnosed with cancer. The purpose of this survey is to examine peer-reviewed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that have been recently developed and utilize machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for the diagnosis of BC. The survey aims to compare these newly developed systems with previously established methods and provide technical details, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with each model. In addition, this paper addresses several unresolved matters, areas of research that require further exploration, and potential avenues for future investigation in the realm of advanced computer-aided design (CAD) models utilized in the interpretation of medical images. Furthermore, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in BC research and treatment holds immense significance by facilitating real-time monitoring and personalized healthcare solutions. IoT devices, such as wearable sensors and smart implants, enable continuous data collection, empowering healthcare professionals to track patients' vital signs, response to treatment, and overall health trends, fostering more proactive and tailored approaches to BC management. Moreover, the advent of 5G technology in BC applications promises to revolutionize communication speeds and data transfer, enabling rapid and seamless transmission of large medical datasets. This high-speed connectivity enhances the efficiency of remote diagnostics, telemedicine, and collaborative research efforts, ultimately accelerating the pace of innovation and improving patient outcomes in BC care. The present study aims to examine various classifiers utilized in ML and DL methodologies for the purpose of diagnosing BC. Research findings have demonstrated that DL has superior performance compared to standard ML methods in the context of BC diagnosis, particularly when the dataset is extensive. The existing body of research indicates that there are significant gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed in order to enhance healthcare outcomes in the future. These gaps highlight the pressing need for both practical and scientific research in the field. Finally, IoT and 5G will be how they can be used in order to enhance BC detection, treatment and patient care.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe concept of Industry 4.0 is flexible monitoring, uninterrupted services, cost-effectiveness, and things connected to networks. Industrial drives with various sensing and controlling units are the key components of every industrial process. In electric drive, the current sensor and speed encoder are used for controlling the system. A fault in the sensing unit could interrupt the process, which causes production losses. In this paper, a fast and smooth switching control strategy is designed and deployed for induction motor drives (IMD) to enhance system reliability and provide uninterrupted services. Based on supervisory decisions, suitable control strategies such as field-oriented control, slip compensation, and scalar control are chosen as alternatives during sensor failure. The adaptive reconfigurable fault-tolerant control technique (ARFTC) is employed for IMD, which can mitigate the transient issues while transitioning between different controls. This ARFTC scheme involves the DC-type feature of the synchronous-frame voltage commands (\n) and the synchronization of the rotor angle between the different control strategies. Under sensor-fault conditions, ARFTC enables better performance on the drive. Furthermore, cost-effective IoT monitoring services are integrated into the system for analyzing the performance of the drive. The proposed ARFTC is deployed in real-time on the industrial drive VLT-302 using the dSPACE MicroLabBox controller and Alborg interfacing and protection card. The proposed adaptive scheme is experimentally evaluated with a 2.2 kW squirrel cage induction motor under various sensor fault conditions. The obtained results shows that the proposed ARFTC is constructive for enhancing the reliability of induction motor drives, especially in sensor failure situations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn software-defined networking (SDN), several controllers improve the reliability as well as the scalability of networks such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT), with the distributed control plan. To achieve optimal results in IoT networks, an SDN can be employed to reduce the complexity associated with IoT and provide an improved quality-of-service (QoS). With time, it is likely expected that the demand for IoT will rise, and a large number of sensors will be connected, which can generate huge network traffic. With these possibilities, the SDN controllers processing capacity will be surpassed by the traffic sent by the IoT sensors. To handle this kind of challenge, and achieve promising results, a dynamic slave controller allocation with a premeditated mechanism can play a pivotal role to accomplish the task management and migration plan. Following this, we proposed an efficient slave controller allocation-based load balancing approach for a multi-domain SDN-enabled IoT network, which aims to transfer switches to a controller with idle resources effectively. Among several slave controllers for selecting a target controller, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) strategy, i.e., an analytical network process (ANP) has been used in our approach to enrich communication metrics and maintain high-standard QoS statistics. Moreover, switch migration is modeled with knapsack 0/1 problem to achieve maximum utilization of the slave controllers. Our proposed scheme enabled with a flexible decision-making process for selecting controllers with varying resources. The results demonstrated with emulation environment show the effectiveness of the ESCALB.",

This system can be widely used in rural areas that are linked to the nearest city hospitals to monitor the patients. The collected data from the monitoring system are stored in the cloud-based data storage and for the classification our approach proposes an innovative Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based Puzzle optimization algorithm (PO). Based on the outcome further treatments are made with the assistance of physicians. Experimental analyses are made and analyzed the performance with state-of-art works. The availability of more data storage capacity in the cloud can make physicians access the previous data effortlessly.",

Wearables is one of the most popular IoT concept nowadays, and Wearable Health devices is becoming widely used nowadays to conduct many useful health related tasks from monitoring vital signs to controlling the insulin level in the patient's blood. These small devices continually sense, collect, and transmit various patientsâ health related data. This transmitted data will be stored and part of the electronic patient care reports (ePCR) which is very private and sensitive information and must be protected from cyber threats. The security of electronic patient care reports (ePCR) is very important in safeguarding sensitive medical information. This paper explores how to implement and authenticate several security measures that secure XML data within ePCR systems. We employ AES-256 encryption to secure data in transit and XML Schema Definition (XSD) to ensure data integrity. We also evaluate the efficiency of these methods by examining the network traffic using Wireshark. We also implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions and enforce access control policies. Our experiment shows the strength of encryption in preventing unauthorized access and the capability of schema validation for detecting manipulated data. The findings present practical insights and recommendations for improving ePCR system security, stressing a multi-layered approach for protecting patient information from being tampered",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, many communities are emerging towards smart environments, requiring the communication and collaboration of diverse Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. A smart environment exploits the use of IoT technology to share and process data among such devices for a better living. However, this comes with additional costs, such as the exponential growth of IoT devices, the heterogeneity of IoT use cases, and the new complex features encountered by IoT data, which complicate their processing and analysis using the traditional techniques. This causes a dramatic performance degradation of the used processing resources, which directly affects the overall efficiency and performance of IoT-based systems. Although different studies have presented resource utilization approaches for IoT systems, but they were not evaluated from different resource utilization perspectives. Besides, no efforts have been directed to investigate their effectiveness to process the unprecedented IoT data features that inevitably impact the accuracy and efficiency of resource utilization. In this paper, the Triple Phases Resource Utilized Data Fusion (TPRUDF) framework is proposed as the first IoT-based cost-aware resource utilization using data fusion. It exclusively considers different IoT data features by employing three phases of data fusion: (1) data in â data out, (2) data in â feature out, and (3) feature in â decision out. TPRUDF fuses the raw IoT data by maintaining the complex IoT data features, independent of the IoT domain or the computing model, using the spatiotemporal data fusion (STDF) IoT-based data fusion approach. TPRUDF then fuses the uncorrelated data features via the Principal Component Analysis. Finally, it employs two different resource utilization techniques: (1) Genetic Algorithms and (2) Particle Swarm Optimization, fusing their results using the voting logic fusion technique. A public edge-computing simulator is used to evaluate TPRUDF via three real-world smart cities datasets. The experimental results of the proposed TPRUDF framework indicate that it: (1) achieves an average accuracy level of resource utilization equal to 91%, (2) increases the resource utilization throughput by an average of 40% and eventually minimizes the processing delay, (3) boosts the resource utilization availability by 60%, and (4) decreases the energy consumption by 35%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been broadly employed as a data collection platform to assist in efficiently collecting data from IoT devices. However, the deployment optimization of UAVs has been challenged due to the need to minimize the energy consumption of UAVs and IoT devices. Several algorithms have been recently proposed for tackling this challenge, but they still have room for improvement due to their slow convergence speed and memory-wasting problems. Therefore, in this study, a new energy-aware approach has been proposed for accurately optimizing the entire deployment of UAVs, which could minimize the total energy consumption. This approach is based on presenting a new encoding mechanism, namely an optimized population size mechanism, for representing both location and number of stop points in an effective manner. In this mechanism, similar to some studies in the literature, the whole population is responsible for the entire deployment, and each individual is responsible for a stop point in this deployment. However, this mechanism presents a novel way to optimize the number of stop points based on adding an auxiliary variable to each stop point to determine whether it will be removed, inserted, or replaced in the newly generated deployment. This variable will be optimized by the optimization techniques during the optimization process to search for the optimal choice for each stop point that could achieve a better deployment. Two well-known optimization techniques, known as differential evolution (DE) and gradient-based optimizer (GBO), are adapted using this mechanism to present new variants, namely DEoPS and GBoPS, for accurately tackling the deployment optimization problem. Two energy consumption formulations are used in our work to investigate the performance of DEoPS and GBoPS. Several experiments have been conducted to compare the performance of both DEoPS and GBoPS with several algorithms on eleven instances. The experimental findings show the effectiveness of GBoPS for the first formulation and the effectiveness of DEoPS for the second formulation.",

        "abstract": "In the smart city paradigm, the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) services and solutions requires extensive communication and computing resources to place and process IoT applications in real time, which consumes a lot of energy and increases operational costs. Usually, IoT applications are placed in the cloud to provide high-quality services and scalable resources. However, the existing cloud-based approach should consider the above constraints to efficiently place and process IoT applications. In this paper, an efficient optimization approach for placing IoT applications in a multi-layer fog-cloud environment is proposed using a mathematical model (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)). This approach takes into account IoT application requirements, available resource capacities, and geographical locations of servers, which would help optimize IoT application placement decisions, considering multiple objectives such as data transmission, power consumption, and cost. Simulation experiments were conducted with various IoT applications (e.g., augmented reality, infotainment, healthcare, and compute-intensive) to simulate realistic scenarios. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the existing cloud-based approach in terms of reducing data transmission by 64% and the associated processing and networking power consumption costs by up to 78%. Finally, a heuristic approach was developed to validate and imitate the presented approach. It showed comparable outcomes to the proposed model, with the gap between them reach to a maximum of 5.4% of the total power consumption.",

Meanwhile, it is arduous to visit medical professionals intermittently by the patients for fear of spreading the disease. This IoT-based healthcare monitoring system is utilized by many professionals, can be accessed remotely, and provides treatment accordingly. In context with this, we designed an IoT-based healthcare monitoring system that sophisticatedly measures and monitors the parameters of patients such as oxygen level, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate. This system can be widely used in rural areas that are linked to the nearest city hospitals to monitor the patients. The collected data from the monitoring system are stored in the cloud-based data storage and for the classification our approach proposes an innovative Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based Puzzle optimization algorithm (PO). Based on the outcome further treatments are made with the assistance of physicians. Experimental analyses are made and analyzed the performance with state-of-art works. The availability of more data storage capacity in the cloud can make physicians access the previous data effortlessly.",

IoT applications suffer from higher latency and limited network bandwidth in the internet core. However, due to bandwidth and resource constraints, the resultant massive data traffic triggers storage overhead, high latency, and network bottleneck problems. Therefore, cloud computing and fog computing are introduced as popular IoT assistance. In fact, using a fog layer with such a highly dynamic environment raises a placement problem that needs to identify the optimal fog node that can be assigned to place the sensed data there. However, using a single copy of the datum in a single node can increase the concurrent access and maximize the network latency. Therefore, replication is considered a known technique to improve availability by publishing many replicas to many sites. However, using replication causes a degree of temporal data inconsistency and requires the application to be tolerant. This work proposes a novel intelligent solution for dynamic consistent replication and optimal placement of IoT using fog computing. The results show the ability of the current work to reduce the system latency and cost of replica access and increase the data availability.",

Construction projects, strikes, and accidents may all be avoided with an effective vehicle routing solution. The Internet of Things (IoT) network simulation for Exigency Vehicle routing is proposed in this research utilizing a linguistic interval type 2 fuzzy logic system (LIT2FLS) based data fusion approach. The predicted effectiveness of our model for intelligent city applications, including emergency vehicle routing, is well demonstrated by the LIT2FLS correlation coefficients of 0.994%. This data fusion approach determines the exact level of congestion for a given place by combining sensory data with crowd reactions. In addition, OSRM employs a road communication system to detect real-time traffic variations and choose the least congested route. Furthermore, a sensor station for gathering the speeds and pollutants of moving automobiles on the road has also been established. An Android app has been developed to collect public information on blockages A driver of an Exigency Vehicle (EV) is directed towards a medical facility with the quickest, congestion-aware path by means of the Application software service. We have created an IT2FLS system that assists with decisions to calculate traffic congestion. Analyze the ability to scale and quickness of response associated with the suggested routing strategy.",

A significant challenge in guaranteeing a high level of end-user experience is the administration of IoT services. IoT networks are constructed using a variety of smart technologies such as detectors, controllers, Radio-frequency identification (RFID), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), Third Generation Cellular Networks (3G), and Global Systems for Mobile communications (GSM). Cloud technology significantly impacts how these networks grow by providing processing capabilities, network bandwidth, virtualized systems, and system software in an integrated environment. Capacity management, which assures effective resource use and load-balancing, avoids service level agreement (SLA) infractions, and enhances machine efficiency by minimizing operational expenses and power utilization, represents one of the fundamental problems in cloud-based ecosystems. To address these concerns, IoT-based robust decision-making resource management is often used. In this study, we investigate resource provisioning methods and identify the factors that must be considered for better utilization of resources in distributed systems. Specifically, we aim to improve the minimization rate, data skew rate, and approximate amount rate. We also highlight the challenges and complexities of hybrid optimization for efficient cloud-based capital allocation in the IoT.",

For the most part, cloud computing platforms handle and manage all of these data and requests. However, for certain applications, the data transmission delay that comes with transferring data from edge devices to the cloud could be unbearable. When there are a lot of devices connected to the internet, the public network actually becomes a bottleneck for data transfer. In this setting, power management, data storage, resource management, and service management all necessitate more robust infrastructure and complex processes. More efficient use of network and cloud resources is achievable with fog computing's âintelligent gatewayâ capability.\nMethodology\nPlanning and managing resources is one of the most important factors affecting system performance (especially latency) in a fog-cloud environment. Planning in an environment with fog and clouds is an NP-hard problem. This paper delves into the optimisation difficulty of longevity for data-intensive job scheduling in fog and cloud-based IoT systems. The issue is initially expressed as an optimisation model for integer linear programming (ILP). Next, we provide a heuristic algorithm known as DLJSF (Data-Locality Aware Job Scheduling in Fog-Cloud) that is based on the suggested formulation.\nResults\nThe results of the tests showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the results by an average of 87 %. Also, on average, it is 99.16 % better than the LP results obtained from the optimal solution obtained from the solver obtained from the solution that the data is processed locally. To check the efficiency of the simulation solution, it was repeated for tasks with different entry rates and data with different sizes.\nConclusion\nAccording to the obtained documents, the data transfer approach can be valuable and the proposed algorithm has not lost its performance in different conditions.",

On the other hand, wireless communications with ubiquitous connectivity and low latency have emerged as a suitable option for smart grid. The design of any DSM system using a wireless network must consider the wireless link impairments, which is missing in existing literature. In this paper, we propose a DSM system using a Real-Time Pricing (RTP) mechanism and a wireless Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) with data transfer uncertainty. A Zigbee-based Internet of Things (IoT) model is considered for the communication infrastructure of the NAN. A sample NAN employing XBee and Raspberry Pi modules is also implemented in real-world settings to evaluate its reliability in transferring smart grid data over a wireless link. The proposed DSM system determines the optimal price corresponding to the optimum system welfare based on the two-way wireless communications among users, decision-makers, and energy providers. A novel cost function is adopted to reduce the impact of changes in user numbers on electricity prices. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system benefits users and energy providers. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that the success rate of data transfer significantly varies over the implemented wireless NAN, which can substantially impact the performance of the proposed DSM system. Further simulations are then carried out to quantify and analyze the impact of wireless communications on the electricity price, user welfare, and provider welfare.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the construction sector, the maintenance and monitoring of buildings are of fundamental importance, both in civil and cultural heritage buildings, ensuring their preservation, safety, and proper functioning over time. The preservation of the built heritage is one of the main objectives that a nation must pursue, and thanks to the ever-increasing spread of new technologies, it is possible to apply innovative approaches capable of monitoring in real-time the progressive damage of structures or intercepting sudden situations capable of causing extensive damage. Traditional monitoring methodologies, employed so far, are based on direct inspections and manual data collection, and are often expensive and only sometimes effective. In this scenario, a significant contribution has been made by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, which has made it possible to collect real-time data from sensors placed on the structures to be monitored, thus enabling the implementation of predictive maintenance methodologies. A further contribution to the development of these methodologies has come from the emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin (DT), a digital model of an intended or actual real-world product, system or physical process that serves as an effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring and maintenance. In order to make the DT even more effective, it is possible to link it to the real structure through BIM, i.e. a process applied to existing buildings or monuments that aims not only at the mere restitution of the three-dimensional model but above all at the creation of so-called âintelligent modelsâ. The latter is rich in geometric information, including the state of conservation of materials, in which all components are parametric objects with well-defined semantics and can contain all the historical information derived from an adequate documentary analysis. Starting from the above, this paper aims to present a methodology for monitoring an existing building, exploiting innovative technologies based on DT and IoT concepts. The case study analyzed is the Scientific Library of the University of Salerno, and the first results of the experiment are more than satisfactory.",

Despite their limited resources, IoT devices collect and share large amounts of data and are connected to the internet, becoming an attractive target for malicious actors.\nThis work uses machine learning combined with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect possible attacks. Due to the limitations of IoT devices and low latency services, the IDS must have a specialized architecture. Furthermore, although machine learning-based solutions have high potential, there are still challenges related to training and generalization, which may impose constraints on the architecture.\nOur proposal is an IDS with a distributed architecture that relies on Fog computing to run specialized modules and use deep neural networks to identify malicious traffic inside IoT data flows. We compare our IoT-Flow IDS with three other architectures. We assess model generalization using test data from different datasets and evaluate their performance in terms of Recall, Precision, and F1-Score. Results confirm the feasibility of flow-based anomaly detection and the importance of network traffic segmentation and specialized models in the AI-based IDS for IoT.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDue to the world's rapid population expansion, the demand for food is anticipated to increase significantly during the coming decade. Traditional farming practices cannot meet the need for the food crop. Conventional farming methods use resources like land, water, herbicides, and fertilisers rather inefficiently. When it comes to making the most effective and sustainable use of resources to increase production, automation in agriculture is garnering a lot of interest. How people and machines operate on farms has been changed by integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with numerous sensors, controllers, and communication protocols. A comprehensive literature review of the key technologies involved in smart and sustainable agriculture, viz. various sensors, controllers, communication standards, IoT based intelligent machinery, were compared and presented. These sensors were continuously producing a significant quantity of data on the agricultural field. These data were transmitted to the central control unit for analysis to meet the demands for water, fertiliser, pesticides, etc. The architecture and importance of data analytics in agriculture IoT, case studies of current agricultural automation utilising IoT, key challenges and open issues in agriculture IoT technology were discussed. The findings provide support for the selection of IoT technologies for specific applications.",

        "abstract": "The lack of modern technology in healthcare has led to the death of thousands of lives worldwide due to COVID-19 since its outbreak. The Internet of Things (IoT) along with other technologies like Machine Learning can revolutionize the traditional healthcare system. Instead of reactive healthcare systems, IoT technology combined with machine learning and edge computing can deliver proactive and preventive healthcare services. In this study, a novel healthcare edge-assisted framework has been proposed to detect and prognosticate the COVID-19 suspects in the initial phases to stop the transmission of coronavirus infection. The proposed framework is based on edge computing to provide personalized healthcare facilities with minimal latency, short response time, and optimal energy consumption. In this paper, the COVID-19 primary novel dataset has been used for experimental purposes employing various classification-based machine learning models. The proposed models were validated using k-cross-validation to ensure the consistency of models. Based on the experimental results, our proposed models have recorded good accuracies with highest of 97.767% by Support Vector Machine. According to the findings of experiments, the proposed conceptual model will aid in the early detection and prediction of COVID-19 suspects, as well as continuous monitoring of the patient in order to provide emergency care in case of medical volatile situation.",

Identity management is believed to be the fundamental keystone to build security mechanisms. The traditional centralized identity management scheme suffers from a single point of failure and identity forgery. A secure IoT system framework was proposed leveraging blockchain as the basic infrastructure with Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) identifying the sensors uniquely. We brought up a scheme to improve the identity authentication protocol. Experiments showed that our approach was more effective and secure against attacks.",

IoT networks encompass a vast array of devices, from smart appliances to industrial sensors, revolutionizing industries and everyday life. However, this ubiquitous connectivity has ushered in a new frontier of security challenges, necessitating the deployment of robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paper presents a pioneering Multi-Method Stacked Feature Selection (M2SFS) approach-based IDS tailored explicitly for IoT networks. By orchestrating a diverse ensemble of feature selection techniques, the M2SFS framework adeptly curates the feature set derived from the CICIDS 2017 dataset. This comprehensive selection strategy optimally reduces dimensionality, mitigating the resource constraints inherent to IoT ecosystems. The proposed IDS, rooted in the M2SFS approach, demonstrates exceptional accuracy and efficiency in detecting anomalous network behaviors. By harnessing the collective strength of stacked feature selection, this IDS capitalizes on the synergistic potential of multiple feature selection methods. The result is an IDS uniquely adapted to the intricacies of IoT networks, effectively fortifying their security posture. Through rigorous experimentation using the CICIDS 2017 dataset, the proposed approach affirms the superiority of the M2SFS-based IDS over conventional methods. This study underscores the pressing need for IDS in IoT environments and highlights the promise of our innovative approach in safeguarding IoT networks against emerging threats.",

Communication between IoT devices is controlled using various types of protocols. A popular example of these protocols is Message Queue Telemetry Protocol (MQTT) which is a lightweight and reliable protocol for communication. However, there have been cyber-attacks that targeted MQTT-IoT networks which raises the attention for an efficient intrusion detection system for detecting such attacks. Popular type of such attacks is brute force attack. In this paper, we propose deep learning for automatic detection of brute force attacks on MQTT-IoT networks. We use a recent dataset, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020 dataset, to train the deep learning model with high number of instances and using flow-based feature. The classification model is very accurate in detection of such attacks with more than 99% accuracy in discriminating between normal and brute force attacks.",

By providing access to the collected data, consumers can monitor the quality of the crops produced. This feature enhances transparency in the agricultural supply chain, empowering consumers to make informed decisions about the agricultural produce they consume.\nAbstract\nAgriculture plays a vital role in feeding the growing global population. But optimizing crop production and resource management remains a significant challenge for farmers. This research paper proposes an innovative ML-enabled IoT device to monitor soil nutrients and provide accurate crop recommendations. The device utilizes the FC-28 sensor, DHT11 sensor, and JXBS-3001 sensor to collect real-time data on soil composition, moisture, humidity, temperature, and for nutrient levels. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze the collected data and generate customized recommendations, including a possible high-yielding crop list, fertilizer names, and its amount based on crop requirements and soil nutrients. Furthermore, the applied fertilizers and treatments to the field during production are stored in the database. As a result, it has become possible to determine the quality of the produce at the consumer level through the mobile app. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through field experiments, comparing its performance with traditional methods. The results demonstrate the device's ability to enhance crop productivity and optimize resource utilization, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and food security. The research contributes to IoT-enabled agriculture, demonstrating the potential of ML techniques in improving soil nutrient management, facilitating informed decision-making about crop fertilizers, and assessing the quality of produced crops at the consumer level.",

In this article, we illustrate a thorough experimental assessment of a self-organising and fault-tolerant monitoring service, FogMon, especially targeting Cloud-IoT settings and capable of probing hardware resource, latency and bandwidth. The assessment is carried out over networks made up of 20 to 40 nodes across two testbeds within the Fed4Fire+ federation. As a result of the assessment, we agilely improved and refined FogMon into FogMon\n, which settles at TRL5 and improves on monitoring accuracy and fault-resiliency. Experimental results show how FogMon\ncan promptly and suitably handle different types of infrastructure failure, with an average relative error of 10% on measurements and limited footprint on hardware and network resources.",

Through an extensive literature review, key assumptions are established, needs are identified, and objectives are formulated. A multi-objective mathematical planning model is proposed to minimize cost and time within the supply chain, with optimization conducted under deterministic and fuzzy conditions. The model utilizes augmented epsilon constraint and weighted sum methods to address its multi-objectiveness. Noteworthy is the integration of advanced technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), blockchain, and online sales, distinguishing it from traditional approaches. Initial validation and testing in smaller dimensions demonstrate the modelâs adaptability to precise methods, while larger dimensions necessitate the use of meta-heuristic algorithms for efficient problem resolution. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in the insurance industry on objective function coefficients reveals intricate relationships, offering valuable insights into optimization dynamics across diverse conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccess control is essential for the IoT environment to ensure that only approved and trusted parties are able to configure devices, access sensor information, and command actuators to execute activities. The IoT ecosystem is subject to various access control complications due to the limited latency between IoT devices and the Internet, low energy requirements of IoT devices, the distributed framework, ad-hoc networks, and an exceptionally large number of heterogeneous IoT devices that need to be managed. The motivation for this proposed work is to resolve the incurring challenges of IoT associated with management and access control security. Each IoT domain implementation has particular features and needs separate access control policies to be considered in order to design a secure solution. This research work aims to resolve the intricacy of policies management, forged policies, dissemination, tracking of access control policies, automation, and central management of IoT nodes and provides a trackable and auditable access control policy management system that prevents forged policy dissemination by applying Software Defined Network (SDN) and blockchain technology in an IoT environment. Integration of SDN and blockchain provides a robust solution for IoT environment security. Recently, smart contracts have become one of blockchain technologyâs most promising applications. The integration of smart contracts with blockchain technology provides the capability of designing tamper-proof and independently verifiable policies. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable solution for implementing immutable, verifiable, adaptive, and automated access control policies for IoT devices together with a successful proof of concept that demonstrates the scalability of the proposed solution. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of throughput and resource access delay between the blockchain component and the controller as well as from node to node. The number of nodes in the IoT network and the number of resource access requests were independently and systematically increased during the evaluations. The results illustrate that the resource access delay and throughput were affected neither linearly nor exponentially; hence, the proposed solution shows no significant degradation in performance with an increase in the number of nodes and/or requests.",

The Internet of Things (IoT) devices may exchange critical data, which makes battery/power, connectivity, and security issues crucial. An automated system for identifying and reporting abnormalities to a central controller is a prerequisite for this. In order to distinguish between approved and legitimate IoT devices, this method should be able to. IoT devices that are malicious, non-IoT devices that are malicious, and other man-in-the-middle traffic sources must all be isolated to prevent noncompliance. For improved QoS management, this aids in the formulation of administrative rules and the regulation and enforcement of network traffic. A framework-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is suggested in this research to discover the aforementioned problems in IoT devices. A system that classifies IoT devices into their respective categories and reliably identifies new entries has been developed based on CNN. The findings demonstrate that CNN is capable of classifying IoT devices into the appropriate categories with the necessary accuracy as well as identifying between IoT and non-IoT devices with better accuracy.",

Shorter delays in transmission between Roadside Units (RSUs) and vehicles, road safety, and smooth traffic flow are the major difficulties of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Machine Learning (ML) was an advanced technique to find hidden insights into ITSs. This article introduces an Improved Arithmetic Optimization with Deep Learning Driven Traffic Congestion Control (IAOADL-TCC) for ITS in Smart Cities. The presented IAOADL-TCC model enables traffic data collection and route traffic on existing routes for avoiding traffic congestion in smart cities. The IAOADL-TCC algorithm exploits a hybrid convolution neural network attention long short-term memory (HCNN-ALSTM) method for traffic congestion control. In addition, an IAOA-based hyperparameter tuning strategy is derived to optimally modify the parameters of the HCNN-ALSTM model. The presented IAOADL-TCC model effectively enhances the flow of traffic and reduces congestion. The experimental validation was performed using the road traffic dataset from the Kaggle repository. The proposed model obtained an average accuracy of 98.03â¯% with an error rate of 1.97â¯%. The experimental analysis stated the superior performance of the IAOADL-TCC approach over other DL methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDue to the widespread availability of services and smart devices, the decentralized internet of things and wireless sensor network-based systems (DIoT and WSN) have drawn the attention of academics and researchers and are still under constant development. Many challenges face the DIoT and WSN networks and need to be solved. The main issue among these challenges is reducing energy consumption in order to increase network lifetime. Energy-efficient routing protocols and the clustering method are the best solutions to this problem. In this paper, Type-2 Fuzzy Harris Hawks Optimization (T2FHHO) is used to choose the best path (route) from the source (cluster head (CH)) to the destination nodes (base station (BS)). Along with this, we propose a new fitness function to find the next hop based on residual energy, distance, traffic, and buffer size. Then, we apply the T2FHHO method to get the best CH. This protocol seeks to increase the long-term reward earned by each node. The best path in terms of the minimum cost obtained using the proposed method is found. The two main contributions of this study are as follows: firstly, we present a new efficient routing approach that minimizes costs and maximizes efficiency. Secondly, we apply the T2FHHO to the network parameters of energy consumption, network lifetime, and convergence curves. The results indicate that T2FHHO outperforms competing methods. The proposed method holds the promise of significantly advancing the state of the art in energy-efficient routing for DIoT and WSN networks, with significant implications in various sectors and applications, ensuring extended network lifetimes and sustainable IoT implementations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSmart Hospital will play a key role in improving the quality of services (QoS) related to the health sector. In the present scenario, it is impossible to accommodate an ageing population with the current infrastructure and facilities provided by conventional hospitals. However, the integration of technologies with the conventional hospital is enhancing the medical services and also making it easier for the public, who can save time and money by getting all the necessary medical facilities while sitting at home. The deployment of the fifth generation (5G) is taking place all over the world. The 5G network offers a better service that can be used in hospitals to make it a smart health service provider with online facilities such as video monitoring, suggesting a proper medical prescription based on medical data, remote surgery, and so on. High bandwidth, a fast data rate, low latency, and a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) are some requirements that need to be fulfilled by the 5G radio. In this work, we focus on improving the power savings, spectral access, latency, and Bit error rate (BER) of the advanced 5G waveforms such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In the first part of the article, we proposed a PAPR reduction algorithm to improve the power efficiency of the power amplifier (PA) for 5G waveforms. Several algorithms are applied to the 5G waveforms, and their performances are estimated in terms of PAPR curves. In the second part, we have utilised advanced detection algorithms to improve the signal detection of the 5G waveforms. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms efficiently enhance the throughput of the framework. In the third part, we improve the spectral efficiency of the 5G waveforms by applying spectrum sensing (SS) algorithms. It is seen that the SS methods efficiently reduce the spectrum leakage of the multi-carrier waveforms (MCW). Finally, we examined the role and challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in smart hospitals. Overall, it is concluded that hospitals can become more effective, cut expenses, and provide better patient care with the aid of AI and IoT. Hospitals can improve patient outcomes and the state of the healthcare system as a whole by utilising these technologies.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicles to act as mobile nodes that can fetch, share, and disseminate information about vehicle safety, emergency events, warning messages, and passenger infotainment. However, the continuous dissemination of information from vehicles and their one-hop neighbor nodes, Road Side Units (RSUs), and VANET infrastructures can lead to performance degradation of VANETs in the existing host-centric IP-based network. Therefore, Information Centric Networks (ICN) are being explored as an alternative architecture for vehicular communication to achieve robust content distribution in highly mobile, dynamic, and error-prone domains. In ICN-based Vehicular-IoT networks, consumer mobility is implicitly supported, but producer mobility may result in redundant data transmission and caching inefficiency at intermediate vehicular nodes. This paper proposes an efficient redundant transmission control algorithm based on network coding to reduce data redundancy and accelerate the efficiency of information dissemination. The proposed protocol, called Network Cording Multiple Solutions Scheduling (NCMSS), is receiver-driven collaborative scheduling between requesters and information sources that uses a global parameter expectation deadline to effectively manage the transmission of encoded data packets and control the selection of information sources. Experimental results for the proposed NCMSS protocol is demonstrated to analyze the performance of ICN-vehicular-IoT networks in terms of caching, data retrieval delay, and end-to-end application throughput. The end-to-end throughput in proposed NCMSS is 22% higher (for 1024 byte data) than existing solutions whereas delay in NCMSS is reduced by 5% in comparison with existing solutions.",

A compact house is one of the dwellings built on limited modern land, providing flexible use of space according to the activities carried out by residents. The current version of this type of residence, namely smart homes, is still far from what is expected. There is a need for the modern use of IoT in every room, which can adapt to the activities of residents to make it easier for residents to move. A grounded theory and descriptive approach was used to find the continuity of modern Industry 4.0 and IoT technology in smart homes with the compact house concept to find the novelty of design standards. The findings are in the form of lighting that can be adjusted via IoT to reduce the crime rates in abandoned homes or in homes that are not active because the residents are traveling.",

        "abstract": "In recent times, technology has advanced significantly and is currently being integrated into educational environments to facilitate distance learning and interaction between learners. Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) into education can facilitate the teaching and learning process and expand the context in which students learn. Nevertheless, learning data is very sensitive and must be protected when transmitted over the network or stored in data centers. Moreover, the identity and the authenticity of interacting students, instructors, and staff need to be verified to mitigate the impact of attacks. However, most of the current security and authentication schemes are centralized, relying on trusted third-party cloud servers, to facilitate continuous secure communication. In addition, most of these schemes are resource-intensive; thus, security and efficiency issues arise when heterogeneous and resource-limited IoT devices are being used. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based architecture that accurately identifies and authenticates learners and their IoT devices in a decentralized manner and prevents the unauthorized modification of stored learning records in a distributed university network. It allows students and instructors to easily migrate to and join multiple universities within the network using their identity without the need for user re-authentication. The proposed architecture was tested using a simulation tool, and measured to evaluate its performance. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed architecture to significantly increase the throughput of learning transactions (40%), reduce the communication overhead and response time (26%), improve authentication efficiency (27%), and reduce the IoT power consumption (35%) compared to the centralized authentication mechanisms. In addition, the security analysis proves the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in resisting various attacks and ensuring the security requirements of learning data in the university network.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nFederated Learning (FL, or Collaborative Learning (CL)) has surely gained a reputation for not only building Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on distributed datasets, but also for starting to play a key role in security and privacy solutions to protect sensitive data and information from a variety of ML-related attacks. This made it an ideal choice for emerging networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially with its state-of-the-art algorithms that focus on their practical use over IoT networks, despite the presence of resource-constrained devices. However, the heterogeneous nature of the current devices and models in complex IoT networks has seriously hindered the FL training process's ability to perform well. Thus, rendering it almost unsuitable for direct deployment over IoT networks despite ongoing efforts to tackle this issue and overcome this challenging obstacle. As a result, the main characteristics of FL in the IoT from both security and privacy aspects are presented in this study. We broaden our research to investigate and analyze cutting-edge FL algorithms, models, and protocols, with a focus on their efficacy and practical application across IoT networks and systems alike. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the recently available protection solutions for FL that can be based on cryptographic and non-cryptographic solutions over heterogeneous, dynamic IoT networks. Moreover, the proposed work provides a list of suggestions and recommendations that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of the adoption of FL and to achieve higher robustness against attacks, especially in heterogeneous dynamic IoT networks and in the presence of resource-constrained devices.",

        "abstract": "Most research works nowadays deal with real-time Internet of Things (IoT) data. However, with exponential data volume increases, organizations need help storing such humongous amounts of IoT data in cloud storage systems. Moreover, such systems create security issues while efficiently using IoT and Cloud Computing technologies. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) has the potential to make IoT data more secure and reliable in various cloud storage services. Cloud-assisted IoTs suffer from two privacy issues: access policies (public) and super polynomial decryption times (attributed mainly to complex access structures). We have developed a CP-ABE scheme in alignment with a Hidden Hierarchy Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (HH-CP-ABE) access structure embedded within two policies, i.e., public policy and sensitive policy. In this proposed scheme, information is only revealed when the userâs information is satisfactory to the public policy. Furthermore, the proposed scheme applies to resource-constrained devices already contracted tasks to trusted servers (especially encryption/decryption/searching). Implementing the method and keywords search resulted in higher access policy privacy and increased security. The new scheme introduces superior storage in comparison to existing systems (CP-ABE, H-CP-ABE), while also decreasing storage costs in HH-CP-ABE. Furthermore, a reduction in time for key generation can also be noted. Moreover, the scheme proved secure, even in handling IoT data threats in the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) case.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol has recently been standardized to provide a lightweight open messaging service over low-bandwidth and resource-constrained communication environments. Hence, it is the primary messaging protocol used by Internet of Things (IoT) devices to disseminate telemetry data in a machine-to-machine approach. Despite its advantages in providing reliable, scalable, and timely delivery, the MQTT protocol is widely vulnerable to flooding and denial of service attacks, specifically, the low-rate distributed denial of services (LR-DDoS). Unlike conventional DDoS, the LR-DDoS attack tends to appear as normal traffic at a very slow rate, which makes it difficult to differentiate from legitimate packets, allowing the packets to move undetected by traditional detection policies. This paper presents an intelligent lightweight detection scheme that can capture LR-DDoS attacks based on MQTT protocol in a software-defined IoT environment. The proposed scheme examines the performance of four machine learning models on a modern dataset (LRDDoS-MQTT-2022) with a minimum feature set (i.e., two features only) and a balanced dataset, namely: decision tree classifier (DTC), multilayer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural networks (ANN), and naÃ¯ve Bayes classifier (NBC). Our exploratory assessment demonstrates the arrogance of the DTC detection scheme achieving an accuracy of 99.5% with peak detection speed. Eventually, our best outcomes outdo existing models with higher prediction rates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBoth Internet of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Networks (SDN) have a major role in increasing efficiency and productivity for smart cities. Despite that, they face potential security threats that need to be reduced. A new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has become necessary to secure them. Many researchers have recently used recent techniques such as machine learning to analyze and identify the rapid growth of attacks and abnormal behavior. Most of these techniques have low accuracy and less scalability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Secured Automatic Two-level Intrusion Detection System (SATIDS) based on an improved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed system differentiates between attack and benign traffic, identifies the attack category, and defines the type of sub-attack with high performance. To prove the efficiency of the proposed system, it was trained and evaluated using two of the most recent realistic datasets; ToN-IoT and InSDN datasets. Its performance was analyzed and compared to other IDSs. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms others in detecting many types of attacks. It achieves 96.35 % accuracy, 96 % detection rate, and 98.4  % precision for ToN-IoT dataset. For InSDN dataset, the results were 99.73 % accuracy, 98.6 % detection rate, and 98.9 % precision.",

        "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) devices are being increasingly used in numerous areas. However, the low priority on security and various IoT types have made these devices vulnerable to attacks. To prevent this, recent studies have analyzed firmware in an emulation environment that does not require actual devices and is efficient for repeated experiments. However, these studies focused only on major firmware architectures and rarely considered exotic firmware. In addition, because of the diversity of firmware, the emulation success rate is not high in terms of large-scale analyses. In this study, we propose the adaptive emulation framework for multi-architecture (AEMA). In the field of automated emulation frameworks for IoT firmware testing, AEMA considers the following issues: (1) limited compatibility for exotic firmware architectures, (2) emulation instability when configuring an automated environment, and (3) shallow testing range resulting from structured inputs. To tackle these problems, AEMA can emulate not only major firmware architectures but also exotic firmware architectures not previously considered, such as Xtensa, ColdFire, and reduced instruction set computer (RISC) version five, by implementing a minority emulator. Moreover, we applied the emulation arbitration technique and input keyword extraction technique for emulation stability and efficient test case generation. We compared AEMA with other existing frameworks in terms of emulation success rates and fuzz testing. As a result, AEMA succeeded in emulating 864 out of 1,083 overall experimental firmware and detected vulnerabilities at least twice as fast as the experimental group. Furthermore, AEMA found a 0-day vulnerability in real-world IoT devices within 24 h.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe progression in quantum computing and the rapid development of quantum computation hardware has raised expectations for its application to commercially relevant use cases in the future. However, the need for high-level quantum programming abstractions and targeted use cases paired with vertical applications, which can directly benefit from quantum computing, remains an open challenge. This paper presents our vision for a decentralized architecture for swarm based IoT systems that leverages a high-level continuous development and integration quantum programming suite to support edge processing capabilities for different use cases across the edge-fog-cloud continuum. The planned Quantum DevKit provides the necessary abstractions and low-level backend interfaces for quantum computing infrastructure, enabling edge computation using quantum processing, with extensions to efficient management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The paper focuses on the presentation of the development kit and its coupling swarm-based architecture that automates the orchestration of the cloud-to-edge continuum, showcasing the potential of quantum technology in edge processing.",

Firstly, a flexible, surface-tolerant, low-profile, and low-cost passive UHF-RFID windshield tag inlay is designed. The tag is prototyped as wet-inlay with silver conductive-ink inkjet printed antenna on Polyethylene-Terephthalate layer, bonded with Higgs-EC IC. The dimension of the antenna is 0.25\n0.05\n. The overall inlay structure is around 0.27\n0.06\n. The antenna is designed at ETSI band, with a return loss of â14 dB at 900 MHz and a read range of 13.3 m and 8 m over lower and upper bands, respectively. The antenna demonstrates an omnidirectional radiation pattern and a maximum gain of 1.92 dBi. The developed prototype is tested in both indoor and outdoor environments. Secondly, the data is sent over the IoT cloud where decision-making is made for authorization. The reader data is transmitted over MQTT broker, via the Scotland 5G network to the MongoDB database using Python module Pymongo. The algorithm for vehicle recognition is written and verified by testing the dummy registered tags for access authorization, with a 100% recognition accuracy. We achieved higher read ranges, surface tolerance, and low profile features, comparatively. The overall system shows optimally great results.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (229KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Some of them are the Internet of Things (IoT). This technical concept solves some of the issues like traffic system, parking lots, and operating electronic devices at home when the user is away. The Internet of things provides wireless access to this system and allows users to maintain one-track parking space availability in the crowded area and on the busy lanes, with the increase in Vehicle population, road congestion in big cities is one of the major consequences. The system majorly focuses on the concept of a parking space detection mechanism that uses sensors in combination with the use of Internet of Things. i.e., it sends parking status to the internet web page. This allows users to see which parking spaces are free and where to park. This is achieved by sending the sensor's data to an IoT platform via the ESP8266 WiFi module, which displays data using HTTP. These types of systems make the user find parking slots easier than creating a mess this process saves the user time as well as improves the easy being by tracking the charges of the vehicle.",

Since it is essential for resource sharing and data security, access control is a security issue in IoT devices. However, it can be difficult to implement common access control methods in IoT device modes with limited resources. Numerous studies have examined the usage of Blockchain in the Internet of Things to address security problems since the advent of the technology. Traditional AC mechanisms, such as Attribute-based Access Control, Role-based Access Control, and Access Control Lists, are unable to provide a manageable, scalable, and accurate mechanism meeting the needs of IoT systems, effectively protecting the hardware and data in large-scale IoT systems. This study thoroughly examines how blockchain-based decentralized architecture can potentially improve IoT access management.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of things (IoT) has become more popular due to the development and potential of smart technology aspects. Security concerns against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have grown along with the need for IoT technologies. Enhanced system security protocols are difficult due to the diverse capabilities of IoT devices and the dynamic, ever-changing environment, and simply applying basic security requirements is dangerous. Therefore, this proposed work designs a malware detection and prevention approach for secure data transmission among IoT gadgets. The malware detection approach is designed with the aid of a deep learning approach. The initial process is identifying attack nodes from normal nodes through a trust value using contextual features. After discovering attack nodes, these are considered for predicting different kinds of attacks present in the network, while some preprocessing and feature extraction strategies are applied for effective classification. The Deep LSTM classifier is applied for this malware detection approach. Once completed malware detection, prevention is performed with the help of the Improved Elliptic Curve Cryptography (IECC) algorithm. A hybrid MA-BW optimization is adopted for selecting the optimal key during transmission. Python 3.8 software is used to test the performance of the proposed approach, and several existing techniques are considered to evaluate its performance. The proposed approach obtained 95% of accuracy, 5% of error value and 92% of precision. In addition, the improved ECC algorithm is also compared with some existing algorithm which takes 6.02 s of execution time. Compared to the other methods, the proposed approach provides better security to IoT gadgets during data transmission.",

This research has found satisfactory results with the DL models and IoT-based components. The best benchmark accuracy for setup-1 was 96% for all of the DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201 architecture, and for setup-2, it was 96% for the Xception model. Finally, we have constructed a hybrid (CNN + Convolutional LSTM) model, for which the accuracy was 97%, outperforming all of the abovementioned state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the research has performed some experiments with the IoT-based Solution. Though the proposed solution has exhibited some drawbacks, but it can be practicable in real-time solutions.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (350KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The system may become unstable when transient situations occur. The power system should be able to perform continuous operation to maintain its voltage within acceptable limits. To achieve more stability and increase its speed of response, an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system requires the inclusion of a controller. The AVR system in the generating station uses the PID controller to adjust the abnormal voltage caused by transient conditions. To maintain the nominal voltage level under all the load conditions in the system, a bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm called Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO) algorithm is proposed to tune the PID controller gain parameters and obtain the optimal gain, thereby the AVR system adjusts the generator terminal voltage to nominal levels. The ARO algorithm inspires natural survival techniques to improve the AVR performance by reducing errors. To maintain a stable voltage profile in a power system, this research mathematically models survival techniques using the Internet of Things (IoT) to obtain an optimal solution. As a result, all devices connected to the power network receive a stable voltage that ensures their voltage reliability. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the AVR system is verified with the MATLAB R2022a model, and the statistics functions are implemented in the module of Pandas, Scipy and mathematical investigations done in Numpy. The proposed ARO algorithm achieves a better voltage profile with less than 12.63% maximum peak overshoot during the system's transient response. The proposed algorithm provides the fastest response and highest stability comparable to other optimisation algorithms.",

An efficient trust-based service ranking scheme (TBSRS) is proposed. The novelty of our design lies in providing accurate trust evaluation and service ranking in the absence of assessment data or presence of untrustworthiness recommendations. TBSRS also addresses the issue about the trustworthiness evaluation of a new service. Service providers are ranking based on the binary fruit fly optimization algorithm in TBSRS. The experimental results demonstrate desirable convergence, accuracy, and resiliency properties of TBSRS, and also demonstrate that TBSRS outperforms Adaptive IoT Trust and IoT-HiTrust in terms of the precision of service selection and other a few performance metrics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid growth of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has opened up new avenues for cyber threats, with ransomware being a primary area of concern. In response to this, proposed study introduces an innovative approach that combines the strength of the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and the precision of Lasso Regression to effectively identify ransomware threats in IIoT settings. Functioning on the Zephyr operating system, the GBM's ability to handle large-scale datasets and traverse complex data dimensions is complemented by Lasso Regression's skill in curbing overfitting and extracting critical features. This combined ML technique is specifically designed to address the diverse data challenges of IIoT, providing a solid line of defense. Comprehensive tests on updated ransomware tools and the established RanSAP & IoT-23 datasets validated our model's capabilities, achieving an impressive 92 percent detection rate while keeping false positives to a minimum. When compared to existing strategies, projected solution showcased superior performance, highlighting its pivotal role in bolstering IIoT security against ransomware attacks. These results shed light on the next steps for ensuring a safer IIoT landscape, emphasizing the need for advanced, flexible cybersecurity measures in our ever-evolving industrial ecosystem.",

In this paper, we propose a decentralized and collaborative machine learning framework specially oriented to resource-constrained devices, usual in IoT deployments. With this aim we propose the following construction blocks. First, an incremental learning algorithm based on prototypes that was specifically implemented to work in low-performance computing elements. Second, two random-based protocols to exchange the local models among the computing elements in the network. Finally, two algorithmics approaches for prediction and prototype creation. This proposal was compared to a typical centralized incremental learning approach in terms of accuracy, training time and robustness with very promising results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a monitoring, control, and management system that allows the interoperability of multiple smart gateways in a greenhouse to bolster automatic decision making on water supplied to the crops in real-time. The system consists of several sensor nodes interconnected by Zigbee to measure ambient and soil parameters to control the greenhouse irrigation process. In addition, a web service is included to help the system manager to visualize and operate the greenhouse on a web platform. The system also supports human decision making to cope with undesirable and unexpected environmental events. Smart gateways enable data reading, storage and edge computing using automatic rules to manage actions in the greenhouse, as well as data transmission for centralized processing in cloud services. The service communication system layer is supported by choreography middleware for messaging distribution, which enables agile scalability. This research proposes a hybrid scheme and compares to a centralized scheme. The latency times in the choreography system were analyzed to find a suitable solution adapted to infrastructure deployment features. Numerical results shows that such an adaptive deployment of the irrigation services among edge and fog layers can reduce the computational load on the gateways, improve system response times, and enhance device performance.",

However, task scheduling and resource allocation pose significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Our research introduces a novel framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning algorithm into an edge-enabled wireless sensor network for multi-objective optimization of the functionality of the Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). This framework extends the traditional Q-learning method to manage large state-action spaces efficiently. It employs a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function, rather than relying on a Q-table, making it more capable of handling complex problems with high-dimensional state spaces. It forms heterogenous data clusters supports an optimal task scheduling and resource allocation policies, sustains key objectives such as minimal energy consumption, latency, efficient resource utilization, and reduced task completion time. The framework's performance is evaluated in a simulated environment mimicking real-world smart farming applications. Results confirm its superiority in enhancing performance metrics and lowering energy consumption, as opposed to traditional networks.",

The biggest problem for blind people is figuring out how to get where they want to go. People with good eyesight need to help these people. Smart shoes are a technique that helps blind people find their way when they walk. So, a special shoe has been made to help blind people walk safely without worrying about running into other people or solid objects. In this research, we are making a new safety system and a smart shoe for blind people. The system is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology and uses three ultrasonic sensors to allow users to hear and react to barriers. It has ultrasonic sensors and a microprocessor that can tell how far away something is and if there are any obstacles. Water and flame sensors were used, and a sound was used to let the person know if an obstacle was near him. The sensors use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to detect motion from almost every side to keep an eye on them and ensure they are safe. To test our proposal, we gave a questionnaire to 100 people. The questionnaire has eleven questions, and 99.1% of the people who filled it out said that the product meets their needs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCollaboration of business processes is essential for business-to-business (B2B) processes. Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been developed for directing and maintaining the atmosphere in smart buildings in real time. In order to optimise the power generation sector and schedule routine maintenance, it is crucial to predict future energy demand. Electricity demand forecasting is difficult because of the complexity of the available demand patterns. Establishing a perfect prediction of energy consumption at the buildingâs level is vital and significant to efficiently managing the consumed energy by utilising a strong predictive model. Low forecast accuracy is just one of the reasons why energy consumption and prediction models have failed to advance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create an IoT-based energy prediction (IoT-EP) model that can reliably estimate the energy consumption of smart buildings. A real-world test case on power predictions is conducted on a local electricity grid to test the practicality of the approach. The proposed (IoT-EP) model selects the significant features as input neurons, the predictable data is selected as output nodes, and a multi-layer perceptron is constructed along with the features of the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The analysis of the proposed IoT-EP model has higher accuracy of 90%, correlation of 89%, and variance of 16% in less training time of 29.2âs, and with a higher prediction speed of 396 (observation/sec). When compared to existing models, the results showed that the proposed (IoT-EP) model outperforms with a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting energy consumption in smart buildings.",

Approximate computing is one of the major techniques used to achieve high performance and energy efficiency in error resistant computationally intense applications. Low power VLSI design is one of the important factors in the designing of new IoT system or reconstructing the existed IoT system. An inexact reverse carry select adder (IRCSLA) with back carry propagation is presented in this work. Three different types of adder implementations were presented in IRCSLA. The method of back carry propagation is applied to the design of both 16-bit ripple carry adder (RCA) & 16-bit carry select adders. These adders were designed in CADENCE schematic tool and simulations were done in Analog Design Environment with 45 nm CMOS technology. The design parameters such as delay and power of the three IRCSLA designs were compared with the existed back carry propagate full adders. IRCSLA-III gives 34.84% reduction in power and 56.91% improvement in delay compared to conventional CSLA adder and also improves the energy at the rate of 86.77% and 71.92% compared to the conventional RCA and a CSLA adder respectively.",

IRIS can boot a Linux kernel image pre-stores in removable media and comprises a data verifier securing the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of the boot process. IRIS is fully developed as a hardware module and the results reveal short boot-up times and a small hardware footprint when implemented on field programmable gate array chips. In addition, IRIS is an open-source generic solution that can be adapted to multiple architectures and includes a crypto-core called E-LUKS that can be used outside the boot-loading process to add confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity to data stored on off-chip storage like a flash device.\nIRIS shows a reduction in lookup tables footprint when compared to other IoT solutions consuming from 90% to 750% less resources and only slightly greater, around 30%, with solutions that only cover authentication and integrity.",

While redundant data maintains reliability, sink nodes waste energy processing the redundant data.\nObjective\nIn order to upholdthe compromiseamong energy ingesting and reliability, necessary to eliminate the redundancies in sensed data up to an appropriate level. Data aggregation algorithms currently assign time slots based on data sensing period and program rate, disregarding packet loss and latency.\nMethodology\nIn this paper, we suggest a cluster based reliable data aggregation (CRDA) scheme for IoTnetwork which ensures data collection and aggregation in energy efficient manner and transfer to another end very effectively. We first introduce a monarch and sine-cosine (MSC) algorithm to form clusters by grouping the IoT sensors which ensures the effective data transferring. In data aggregation phase, we utilize the multiple design metrics to compute the trust degree of each IoT sensors and design an improved sunflower optimization (ISFO) algorithm to optimize the design constraints. The highest trust degree owned swelling is act as cluster head (CH) of the cluster which ensures data aggregation. A reformative optimalâlearning-based deep neural network (ROL-DNN) is then used to compute routes between IoT sensors which ensures reliabledata aggregation and transferring.\nResults\nand analysis: Finally, we validate our proposed routing with the different simulation scenario and their results are compared with the existing routing protocols to prove the effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nArticle history\nIn Korea, the use of fire-detection systems applying IoT technology to existing analog fire-alarm systems has increased owing to the communication technology convergence, the world's best Internet network, and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT). Its use can be expected to increase worldwide in the future. For IoT-based fire-detection systems to exhibit the requisite reliability (based on a low false-alarm rate), research related to the analysis of detection signals should be actively promoted and conducted. However, there has been no research activity based on actual operational data, apart from the research that has been conducted in laboratory environments. The primary reason for this state of affairs has been that the installation and use of IoT-based fire-detection systems on a large scale has been rare, worldwide. Consequently, with respect to the fire-signal characteristics of IoT-based fire-detection systems, related data in this study were obtained by investigating actual fire accident cases, using fire alarm data that occurred over a period of 5 years. Based on the signal pattern analysis results using these field data, a fuzzy logic system for recognizing fire signal patterns was developed and verified. As a result, in the actual fire accidents examined, an âalarmâ conditionâcorresponding to the high possibility of fire among the five fire alarmsâwas determined 30 s before the actual fire alarm. Moreover, it was also found that approximately 80% of non-fire alarms could be reduced in the actual fire alarms that occurred at Institute K during the 5-year period examined.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman activity recognition is increasingly recognized as a key task in many applications. However, gathering data from the variety of sensors commonly available on end devices risks compromising userâs privacy when signals are transmitted to more powerful computing units for inference offloading. It is therefore important to design and implement strategies that could prevent privacy breaches without impairing the capability of the system of recognizing activity patterns, and by taking into account the energy constraints of low-power devices. In this work, we propose an energy-aware approach aimed at preserving the privacy of users during inference of human activities. The proposed method is based on a deep learning autoencoder trained to process the signal in order to remove the most sensitive information regarding privacy attributes, without significantly impacting classification accuracy. We also perform a thorough architectureâs parameter tuning of the designed system to enable its implementation on a low-power platform, which we also characterize in terms of energy expenditure. Experimental results show that this system is capable of effectively transforming the signal in order to prevent the inference of sensitive attributes (i.e. weight, height, age, and gender) and it can be conveniently implemented on a constrained embedded system at different levels of the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption. Indeed, a complete obfuscation of sensitive attributes can be achieved at the cost of a marginal reduction in classification accuracy (5% at most), with an expenditure of around 165 mJ for an execution time of around 30ms needed during the signal transformation step.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn mobile computing environments, most IoT devices connected to networks experience variable error rates and possess limited bandwidth. The conventional method of retransmitting lost information during transmission, commonly used in data transmission protocols, increases transmission delay and consumes excessive bandwidth. To overcome this issue, forward error correction techniques, e.g., Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) can be used in data transmission. The primary challenge in RLNC-based methodologies is sustaining a consistent coding ratio during data transmission, leading to notable bandwidth usage and transmission delay in dynamic network conditions. Therefore, this study proposes a new block-based RLNC strategy known as Adjustable RLNC (ARLNC), which dynamically adjusts the coding ratio and transmission window during runtime based on the estimated network error rate calculated via receiver feedback. The calculations in this approach are performed using a Galois field with the order of 256. Furthermore, we assessed ARLNC's performance by subjecting it to various error models such as Gilbert Elliott, exponential, and constant rates and compared it with the standard RLNC. The results show that dynamically adjusting the coding ratio and transmission window size based on network conditions significantly enhances network throughput and reduces total transmission delay in most scenarios. In contrast to the conventional RLNC method employing a fixed coding ratio, the presented approach has demonstrated significant enhancements, resulting in a 73% decrease in transmission delay and a 4 times augmentation in throughput. However, in dynamic computational environments, ARLNC generally incurs higher computational costs than the standard RLNC but excels in high-performance networks.",

Multitude of technologies are contributing to an abundance of information sources which are already the baseline for multi-millionaire services and applications. Internet of Things (IoT), is probably the most representative one. However, for an economy of data to actually flourish there are still several critical challenges that have to be overcome. Among them, data quality can become an issue when data come from heterogeneous sources or have different formats, standards and scale. Improving data quality is of utmost importance for any domain since data are the basis for any decision-making system and decisions will not be accurate if they are based on inadequate low-quality data. In this paper we are presenting a solution for assessing several quality dimensions of IoT data streams as they are generated. Additionally, the solution described in the paper actually improves the quality of data streams by curating them through the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques. The approach followed in our work has been to append data quality information as metadata linked to each individual piece of curated data. We have leveraged linked-data principles and integrated the developed AI-based IoT data curation mechanisms within a Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that employs the NGSI-LD standard to harmonize and enrich heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, we have evaluated our design under experimental research conditions, achieving a robust compromise between functionality and overhead. Besides, it demonstrates a stable and scalable performance.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables end users to access networking services amongst diverse kinds of electronic devices. IoT security mechanism is a technology that concentrates on safeguarding the devices and networks connected in the IoT environment. In recent years, False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) have gained considerable interest in the IoT environment. Cybercriminals compromise the devices connected to the network and inject the data. Such attacks on the IoT environment can result in a considerable loss and interrupt normal activities among the IoT network devices. The FDI attacks have been effectively overcome so far by conventional threat detection techniques. The current research article develops a Hybrid Deep Learning to Combat Sophisticated False Data Injection Attacks detection (HDL-FDIAD) for the IoT environment. The presented HDL-FDIAD model majorly recognizes the presence of FDI attacks in the IoT environment. The HDL-FDIAD model exploits the Equilibrium Optimizer-based Feature Selection (EO-FS) technique to select the optimal subset of the features. Moreover, the Long Short Term Memory with Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) model is also utilized for the purpose of classification. At last, the Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is employed as a hyperparameter optimizer in this study. To validate the enhanced performance of the HDL-FDIAD model, a wide range of simulations was conducted, and the results were investigated in detail. A comparative study was conducted between the proposed model and the existing models. The outcomes revealed that the proposed HDL-FDIAD model is superior to other models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSmart Buildings (SBs) employ the latest IoT technologies to automate building operations and services with the objective of increasing operational efficiency, maximising occupant comfort, and minimising environmental impact. However, these smart devices â mostly cloud-based â can capture and share a variety of sensitive and private data about the occupants, exposing them to various privacy threats. Given the non-intrusive nature of these devices, individuals typically have little or no awareness of the data being collected about them. Even if they do and claim to care about their privacy, they fail to take the necessary steps to safeguard it due to the convenience offered by the IoT devices. This discrepancy between user attitude and actual behaviour is known as the âprivacy paradoxâ. To address this tension between data privacy, consent and convenience, this paper proposes a novel solution for informed consent management in shared smart spaces. Our proposed Informed Consent Management Engine (ICME) (a) increases user awareness about the data being collected by the IoT devices in the SB environment, (b) provides fine-grained visibility into privacy conformance and compliance by these devices, and (c) enables informed and confident privacy decision-making, through digital nudging. This study provides a reference architecture for ICME that can be used to implement diverse end-user consent management solutions for smart buildings. A proof-of-concept prototype is also implemented to demonstrate how ICME works in a shared smart workplace. Our proposed solution is validated by conducting expert interviews with 15 highly experienced industry professionals and academic researchers to understand the strengths, limitations, and potential improvements of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIoT devices typically encompass objects or devices equipped with software and internet connectivity, allowing them to collect data. They have limited processing power, memory, and storage. These limitations can make it difficult to secure these devices, as traditional security measures may not be practical. Implementing security for IoT devices can be challenging due to these characteristics, but several steps can be taken to mitigate these challenges. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) can secure resource constrained IoT devices by providing a more efficient method of encryption and authentication than traditional methods such as RSA. In this paper, we analyzed the lightweight cryptographic algorithm ECC for securing resource-constrained devices such as IoT and evaluated its performance compared to the RSA cryptosystem. The analysis result indicates that ECC is considered to provide stronger security than RSA for the same key length. The CoAP protocol is applied to devices with limited resources, and an examination of its impact is conducted, considering three key performance metrics: CPU usage, bandwidth efficiency, and message communication latency.",

There are several challenges to be addressed in this sector, such as food security and climate change. Agriculture 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology paradigms aim to address these challenges, allowing for sustainable usage of natural resources and application of novel farming practices. This paper introduces an innovative smart IoT-based prototype system that supports precision irrigation of crops and enables real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting. It is based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (SBC) for data logging using various sensors that monitor soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature and UV light. Farmersâ Intelligent Actuation systems have full access to all relevant raw data, in order to choose when, where and how much to irrigate. The respective precision irrigation prototype system has been evaluated over series of experiments and the respective findings are presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSoil permeability tests require a time series of water level measurements to determine system losses, including both infiltration and evaporation. Laboratory measurements of flow are standardised by international regulations such as ASTM International, ISO or UNE, but field measurements are not as well described and in some cases may require definition and specification of test conditions. This is the case for geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) products, where permeability is assessed by a laboratory measurement using a flexible wall permeameter as defined in standard test method D 5887-04. This method is not able to evaluate the performance of such products in the field and therefore cannot guarantee their ability to be used for the repair of landfill liner overlays. For this reason, we have defined a field test in a confined steel ring and developed a real-time ultrasonic IoT device to evaluate water losses over a period of time. The test method was applied in Mallorca (Spain) and as a result the quality of a landfill cover repair solution was evaluated, the corresponding civil works were carried out and the basis for future field measurements of soil permeability tests on different materials and conditions was established.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (286KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The majority of publicly accessible security mechanisms for health information do not concentrate on the flow of information from IoT different sensors installed upon the person's blood through networking devices to primary health care centers. In this paper, we investigated the potential risks of unprotected transmission data, particularly among IoT sensor systems and network gateways. The study encourages the transmission of health insurance data to hospitals remotely. The proposed health care information model would encode immediately so that the sensing element before even being transferred to cryptographic techniques. To use a laboratory configuration with two-stage cryptography at the IoT sensor and two-stage decoding at the physician's surgery receptor, the prototype system was validated. The test results for a complete safety system for IoT - based on the transmission of healthcare data seem good. The study opens up new avenues for information security on IoT devices.",

Unfortunately, these devices are more and more targeted by cyberattacks because of their diffusion and of the usually limited hardware and software resources. This calls for designing and evaluating new effective approaches for protecting IoT systems at the network level (Network Intrusion Detection Systems, NIDSs). These in turn are challenged by the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the growing volume of transmitted data.\nTo tackle this challenge, we select a Deep Learning architecture to perform unsupervised early anomaly detection. With a data-driven approach, we explore in-depth multiple design choices and exploit the appealing structural properties of the selected architecture to enhance its performance. The experimental evaluation is performed on two recent and publicly available IoT datasets (IoT-23 and Kitsune). Finally, we adopt an adversarial approach to investigate the robustness of our solution in the presence of Label Flipping poisoning attacks. The experimental results highlight the improved performance of the proposed architecture, in comparison to both well-known baselines and previous proposals.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn multi-hop routing, Internet of Things (IoT) node energy constraints remain a critical issue in the routing process, and effective energy-efficient relay selection algorithms are considered as one of the important ways to solve this problem. Therefore, in order to better improve the efficiency of the network under limited energy and extend the life of the entire network, this paper proposes a novel energy-saving Relay Selection Algorithm based on Olive Forwarding Area (OFA-RSA). The algorithm optimizes the network energy utilization by taking the maximum transmit distance of nodes under unit energy consumption as the objective function, which fully takes into account the inherent fading characteristics of the wireless channel and the circuit energy consumption of nodes. Find the optimal olive forwarding area through the optimal value of the objective function of the maximum transmission distance of the node under unit energy consumption, and then within the optimal olive forwarding area, the next-hop relay node is selected based on the node's geographical location information. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this article has certain advantages in terms of interruption probability and energy consumption balance, and can significantly improve the energy utilization efficiency of the entire network. This has certain significance in resource-constrained environments such as wireless sensor networks.",

While enabling communication for a large number of stations with RAW in IEEE 802.11ah, the state-of-the-art solutions for channel access are deficient in dealing with both periodic uplink and event-driven downlink actuation at the same time, as per the applicationâs criteria. In this paper, we propose IoT-MAC, a downlink traffic-aware Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for automation in smart spaces. The proposed scheme uses new RAW frames to schedule downlink actuation traffic, considering the periodicity and freshness of uplink traffic. IoT-MAC identifies the periodicity of uplink traffic and schedules a frame without further contention. It then prioritizes critical downlink traffic without losing fresh uplink data. The performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in terms of throughput, delay, power consumption and packet loss for running different IoT applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe forthcoming era of industrialization is marked by intelligent production, with the manufacturing industry and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) driving the creation and innovation of new concepts and systems. One innovative solution addressing the demands of industrial settings is the time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) protocol, known for its ultra-low power consumption and reliable communication. However, the scheduling mechanism at the core of TSCH requires substantial time for every node. In this study, we propose a sustainable scheduling method for Industrial IoT networks called Linguistic Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic System (LIT2FLS) based Priority Aware TSCH (LIT2FLPAS). The suggested method aims to promote service diversification to extend battery life and reduce delay. The significance of each node is determined by the LIT2FLS method, which allocates the required number of slots based on priority and the volume of generated traffic. We compare our proposed LIT2FLPAS algorithm with two state-of-the-art scheduling functions, Scheduling Function-Zero (SF0) and Low Latency Scheduling Function (LLSF). The results demonstrate that LIT2FLPAS exhibits superior adaptability compared to SF0 and LLSF. It provides collision-free communications and significantly enhances the duty cycle by 8%, battery life by 30.32%, and packet loss ratio by 95% while reducing latency by 75.69% and collisions by 91%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the LIT2FLPAS algorithm in addressing the specific challenges of industrial IoT networks, offering improved performance metrics and robust communication in dynamic industrial environments. The proposed method presents a promising solution for achieving efficient and reliable communication in the evolving landscape of intelligent industrial production.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe number of Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications is constantly increasing, and transferring all their associated data to a remote centralized cloud requires more latency, energy, bandwidth, and cost. In such cases, the fog layer as a new computing paradigm supports resource-constrained IoT devices. Fog computing equipment at the network edge can allocate its resources to process real-time IoT applications. IoT application placement mechanisms in the fog environment have been developed to address these issues. According to microservice architecture, subordinate services of IoT applications can be independently deployed on fog servers. Hence, optimal utilization of fog resources is of great importance to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) and requires a distributed and autonomous mechanism to solve the Service Placement Problem (SPP) in fog. Motivated by the generalizability shortcomings of existing approaches, we use the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm as a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve SPP. The proposed scheme focuses on the placement of IoT services with the objectives of minimizing cost and latency under deadline and resource constraints. According to these objectives, A3C seeks to maximize the long-term cumulative reward for improving QoS. We perform placement on local fog domains and use neighboring fog domains when needed to improve fog utilization. In addition, a resource distribution extraction technique over time is considered to save more resources to handle future requests. The simulation results show that our mechanism significantly improves the cost and latency compared to its counterparts such as DDQL and IMPALA.",

Efficient and reliable data routing is one of the major challenges in the Internet of Things network due to the heterogeneity of nodes. This paper presents a traffic-aware, cluster-based, and energy-efficient routing protocol that employs traffic-aware and cluster-based techniques to improve the data delivery in such networks. The proposed protocol divides the network into clusters where optimal cluster heads are selected among super and normal nodes based on their residual energies. The protocol considers multi-criteria attributes, i.e., energy, traffic load, and distance parameters to select the next hop for data delivery towards the base station. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated through the network simulator NS3.40. For different traffic rates, number of nodes, and different packet sizes, the proposed protocol outperformed LoRaWAN in terms of end-to-end packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, end-to-end delay, and network lifetime. For 100 nodes, the proposed protocol achieved a 13% improvement in packet delivery ratio, 10 ms improvement in delay, and 10 mJ improvement in average energy consumption over LoRaWAN.",

This can lead to the IoT Massive Access Problem that causes buffer overflow, large end-to-end delays and missed deadlines. This paper analyzes a novel traffic shaping method named the Quasi-Deterministic Traffic Policy (QDTP) that mitigates this problem by shaping the incoming traffic without increasing the end-to-end delay or dropping packets. Using queueing theoretic techniques and extensive data driven simulations with real IoT datasets, the value of QDTP is shown as a means to considerably reduce congestion at the Gateway, and significantly improve the IoT networkâs overall performance.",

IoT devices are used in healthcare for remote monitoring of vital signs, transmission and reception of private data, and other similar applications. Protection from cyber threats is the most vital aspect of IoT device operation. Malicious activities result in the leakage of sensitive data and the malfunctioning of devices, which becomes a critical issue. As a result, it is now a serious endeavor to create effective solutions that can safeguard the data and record exchange networks of every IoT device. To address some critical issues with current consensus algorithms, this paper proposes the verifiable random ranking (VRR) based Secure Blockchain Consensus (SBC) mechanism. In place of conventional algorithms, we developed new techniques for managing active nodes and evaluating node reliability and robustness. Our experiments show that the VRR-SBC algorithm speeds up consensus, improves security, and reduces the price of verification. The results of the simulation demonstrate the usefulness of the blockchain era for limited devices and provide an opportunity to assess the scope of the consensus algorithm's applicability.",

The DG is a hybrid machine that generates electrical energy using a Diesel Engine (DE) and an Electric Generator (EG). By routinely monitoring crucial machine parameters, alternative power source efficiency can be improved. Furthermore, Condition Monitoring Systems (CMS) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have supplanted the traditional equipment maintenance method. Predictive maintenance is also an important building block of Industry 4.0, whose entire process and performance can be fully understood by using IoT-enabled Remote Monitoring (RM) schemes. Firstly, this paper introduces a remote monitoring and data acquisition scheme to realize the concept of predictive maintenance. Secondly, this article discusses a strategy for real-time observation of DG parameters as well as a comprehensive analysis of various metrics. Thirdly, this research article includes a monitoring and analysis scheme of crucial factors in a DG, like the speed of an engine, voltage output, the current produced, power factor, coolant required, fuel consumption, and battery health. Different mathematical models are formulated by correlating experimental data and estimating the coefficients. Finally, to create suitable real-time warnings under critical circumstances, a fuzzy logic-based Decision Support System (DSS) and web-based integration elements are presented.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, safety accidents in university laboratories have occurred frequently. Not only do the accidents result in property damage, but also in injuries. Real-time environmental monitoring of the laboratory through IoT enables early detection of potential safety risks such as high temperatures, high humidity and gas leaks, and timely action to reduce the likelihood of accidents. To ensure laboratory safety, in the paper, an emergency treatment mechanism for laboratory safety accidents was proposed based on IoT and context perception. The mechanism uses sensors to collect environmental information and fill a feature characterization architecture for unified safety management. Subsequently, the meta-rule algorithm is used to discover services in the prior knowledge model to form a workflow engine, so as to drive the security business management. Additionally, based on the standard measurement model, we normalize the fuzzy uncertainty measurement model with different granularities and define the fuzzy uncertainty of different emergency decision-making knowledge. Based on this, a knowledge fusion method for emergency decision-making under different fuzzy uncertainties is proposed, which improves laboratory safety emergency response performance based on situational awareness. The implementation of the proposed mechanism in a chemical laboratory demonstrates its efficacy in optimizing operational processes and discovering operational flow through multi-dimensional information analysis. This capability significantly aids safety administrators in their daily laboratory safety management.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study introduces a MIMO antenna system incorporating an epsilon negative Meta Surface (MS). The systemâs architects intended for it to have a large usable frequency range, high gain, narrow inter-component spacing, and superior isolation properties with four elements of MIMO antenna that are strategically organized in an orthogonal arrangement and a compact form factor measuring 41 Ã 41 Ã 1.6 mm\n, utilizing a low-loss Rogers RT5880 substrate. The architecture of the antenna is characterized by integrating a multi-slotted radiating patch, a partial ground plane, and an epsilon-negative Meta Surface. This integration is done by a 7 Ã 7 Metamaterial array at the back of the MIMO antenna with a dimension of 41 Ã 41 Ã 1.6 mm\n, resulting in a collective enhancement of the antennaâs overall performance by affecting the phase, amplitude, electromagnetic field and reducing the backward radiation. The separation between the Meta-surface and the MIMO antenna is established at a distance of 6 mm. The antennaâs exceptional super wideband performance is increased from 2â19 GHz to 1.9â20 GHz after using the MS. Moreover, isolation increases from 20 dB to 25.5 dB, Realized gain from 4.5 dBi to 8 dBi, and radiation efficiency from 77% to 89% across the operational bandwidth. The MIMO antenna exhibits remarkable diversity characteristics, as indicated by an envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of\n0.004, a diversity gain (DG) surpassing 9.98 dB, a channel capacity loss (CCL) below 0.3, and a total active reflection coefficient (TARC) measuring 12 dB. Furthermore, a circuit analogous to a resistorâinductorâcapacitor (RLC) system is constructed, and four regression methods from the field of machine learning are employed to validate the gain and efficiency achieved. Notably, the linear regression model exhibits exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 99%. The MIMO antenna design demonstrates significant potential for many applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), specifically focusing on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. These highlight its appropriateness for emerging IoT sectors.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought convenience to peopleâs lives; however further development of IoT faces serious challenges, such as limited energy and shortage of network spectrum resources. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer IoT adaptive time slot resource allocation (SIATS) algorithm. First, an adaptive time slot consisting of periods for sensing, information transmission, and energy harvesting is designed to ensure that the minimum energy harvesting requirement is met while the maximum uplink and downlink throughputs are obtained. Second, the optimal transmit power and channel assignment of the system are obtained using the Lagrangian dual and gradient descent methods, and the optimal time slot assignment is determined for each IoT device such that the sum of the throughput of all devices is maximized. Simulation results show that the SIATS algorithm performs satisfactorily and provides an increase in the throughput by up to 14.4% compared with that of the fixed time slot allocation (FTS) algorithm. In the case of a large noise variance, the SIATS algorithm has good noise immunity, and the total throughput of the IoT devices obtained using the SIATS algorithm can be improved by up to 34.7% compared with that obtained using the FTS algorithm.",

Security is the main progressive concept in smart-related Internet of Things (IoT) software denied networks to share and increase the scalability and efficiency in data storage. Because of the rapid growth of different smart services, different security-related problems may appear in resource processing and sharing data in real-time computing systems. To increase the reliability in secure data storage and satisfy the basic requirements related to IoT-related smart computing networks. So propose and implement a Novel Artificial Intelligence based Blockchain Secure Model (NAIBSM) to provide efficient secure data storage in IoT-related smart computing systems. This model flexibly captures each user authentication for the detection of different user-related attacks (i.e. distributed denial-of-service (DDOS)) in the storage of data via applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) calculation method i.e. Leverage Bat algorithm to explore complex features. Build a blockchain at the server side to provide secure communication and reliability of storing data on the terminal of IoT. This approach provides random hash values to each data to ensure blockchain for the integrity of data and uses a weight-based data storage procedure to arrange/store and classify data to each user with secure and unsecured storage in smart computing networks. The experimental results of the proposed model are to explore complex security features and ensure the performance of secure authentication to each user and better security, accuracy, and low communication overhead in IoT-related smart computing data storage and sharing systems.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, wireless networks are widely used in different domains. This phenomenon has increased the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their applications. Though IoT has numerous advantages, the commonly-used IoT devices are exposed to cyber-attacks periodically. This scenario necessitates real-time automated detection and the mitigation of different types of attacks in high-traffic networks. The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique and the Machine Learning (ML)-based intrusion detection technique are effective tools that can quickly respond to different types of attacks in the IoT networks. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) models can be employed to secure the SDN-enabled IoT environment in this scenario. The current study devises a Harmony Search algorithm-based Feature Selection with Optimal Convolutional Autoencoder (HSAFS-OCAE) for intrusion detection in the SDN-enabled IoT environment. The presented HSAFS-OCAE method follows a three-stage process in which the Harmony Search Algorithm-based FS (HSAFS) technique is exploited at first for feature selection. Next, the CAE method is leveraged to recognize and classify intrusions in the SDN-enabled IoT environment. Finally, the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters. This process improves the outcomes of the intrusion detection process executed by the CAE algorithm and shows the workâs novelty. The proposed HSAFS-OCAE technique was experimentally validated under different aspects, and the comparative analysis results established the supremacy of the proposed model.",

Further, deployment of power negotiating algorithms with reliable communication capability is essential to reduce the overall power consumption and hence, minimize the electricity cost.\nâ¢\nA comprehensive initiative in smart grid is essential, which includes energy management framework associated with an IoT environment that monitors and visualizes power consumption at the consumer premises.\nâ¢\nOptimization techniques are to be evaluated to find the cost effective and computationally efficient approach for the given demand side consumer constraints.\nâ¢\nAccurate prediction of power generation or power availability is required for Proper scheduling mechanism.\nAbstract\nEffectively utilizing renewable energy sources while avoiding power consumption restrictions is the problem of demand-side energy management. The goal is to develop an intelligent system that can precisely estimate energy availability and plan ahead for the next day in order to overcome this obstacle. The Intelligent Smart Energy Management System (ISEMS) described in this work is designed to control energy usage in a smart grid environment where a significant quantity of renewable energy is being introduced. The proposed system evaluates various predictive models to achieve accurate energy forecasting with hourly and day-ahead planning. When compared to other predictive models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) seems to have better performance accuracy. Then, using the anticipated requirements, the experimental setup for ISEMS is shown, and its performance is evaluated in various configurations while considering features that are prioritized and associated with user comfort.

IoT is now a commonplace tool used by technology companies but is rarely used in biology experiments. IoT can benefit cloud biology research through alarm notifications, automation, and the real-time monitoring of experiments. We developed an IoT architecture to control biological devices and implemented it in lab experiments. Lab devices for electrophysiology, microscopy, and microfluidics were created from the ground up to be part of a unified IoT architecture. The system allows each device to be monitored and controlled from an online web tool. We present our IoT architecture so other labs can replicate it for their own experiments.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (201KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) network is comprised of heterogeneous devices which are part of critical infrastructures throughout the world. To enable end-to-end security, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is undergoing advancements to incorporate IoT devices globally which primarily provides device authentication. In addition to this, integrity of the software-state is vital, where Remote Attestation (RA) and Integrity Certificates play an important role. Though, Integrity Certificate verifies the software-state integrity of the device at the time of execution of the remote attestation process, it does not provide mechanisms to validate that the current software-state corresponds to the attested state. This issue is referred to as the Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) problem and remains unsolved in the context of Integrity Certificates.\nIn this paper, we propose AutoCert, the first TOCTOU-secure mechanism to combine software-state integrity with PKI for IoT which resolves the TOCTOU problem in RA and Integrity Certificates. To this end, we utilize the IETF Remote Attestation Procedures architecture and standard X509 IoT profile certificates to ensure both device authentication and software assurance for IoT. We implement and evaluate the performance of the AutoCert proof-of-concept on a real IoT device, the OPTIGA TPM Evaluation Kit, to show its practicality and usability. AutoCert can validate the attested state of an IoT device in approximately 4746 milliseconds, with a minimal network overhead of 350 bytes.",
