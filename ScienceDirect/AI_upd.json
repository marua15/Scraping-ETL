    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThe study uses heuristic-systematic model of the algorithmic process, parasocial interaction, regulatory engagement theory.\nâ¢\nThe authenticity concept in AI context goes beyond social presence and includes credibility, integrity, and symbolism.\nâ¢\nMedia richness, co-branding fit, and parent-brand attitude are antecedents for authenticity in AI-powered service apps.\nâ¢\nDifferent combinations of media, brand, social, and personal factors can foster the perception of authenticity.\nâ¢\nThis research contributes to algorithmic experience, authenticity, and engagement literature.\nAbstract\nMobile applications integrated with artificial intelligence play a vital role in engaging users with the services thanks to their ability to perform natural interactions and conduct various tasks. Despite usersâ quest for authenticity, limited studies have explored the notion of authenticity of this non-human humanlike touchpoint. Study 1 (n = 331) explores the four dimensions of authenticity in the context of AI-powered service apps. Using regulatory engagement and parasocial interaction theory, study 2 (n = 309) confirms media richness, parent brand attitudes, and co-branding fit as influencing factors of perceived authenticity in the context of AI-powered service apps. The six solutions from fsQCA reveal the different but equally important combinations of media, brand, endorser, and personal factors to achieve a high perception of authenticity. This study contributes to the algorithmic experience literature by extending the idea of âproper meansâ in the AI-powered context.",

New health interventions that use AI to perform their functions are increasingly expected to be developed. To date, the reporting of economic evaluations (EEs) of AI-based health interventions appears to lack important details regarding the AI nature of the intervention and potential implications for cost-effectiveness results.\nâ¢\nThe Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) checklist is intended to standardize reporting of EEs of health technologies that use AI. Developed using a Delphi study, it contains 38 reporting items in total. It comprises the original 28 CHEERS-2022 checklist items with 8 elaborations to draw out potential AI-related nuances, plus 10 new AI-specific items that extend upon CHEERS-2022.\nâ¢\nThe CHEERS-AI checklist will ensure that important details relating to the AI nature of the intervention and implications for the analysis are reported in a transparent and reproducible way. CHEERS-AI will also support the interpretation and comparison of such studies by reviewers and decision makers. It will raise the standard of EEs reporting for AI technologies as their presence in healthcare proliferates.\nAbstract\nObjectives\nEconomic evaluations (EEs) are commonly used by decision makers to understand the value of health interventions. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide reporting guidelines for EEs. Healthcare systems will increasingly see new interventions that use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform their function. We developed Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) to ensure EEs of AI-based health interventions are reported in a transparent and reproducible manner.\nMethods\nPotential CHEERS-AI reporting items were informed by 2 published systematic literature reviews of EEs and a contemporary update. A Delphi study was conducted using 3 survey rounds to elicit multidisciplinary expert views on 26 potential items, through a 9-point Likert rating scale and qualitative comments. An online consensus meeting was held to finalize outstanding reporting items. A digital health patient group reviewed the final checklist from a patient perspective.\nResults\nA total of 58 participants responded to survey round 1, 42, and 31 of whom responded to rounds 2 and 3, respectively. Nine participants joined the consensus meeting. Ultimately, 38 reporting items were included in CHEERS-AI. They comprised the 28 original CHEERS 2022 items, plus 10 new AI-specific reporting items. Additionally, 8 of the original CHEERS 2022 items were elaborated on to ensure AI-specific nuance is reported.\nConclusions\nCHEERS-AI should be used when reporting an EE of an intervention that uses AI to perform its function. CHEERS-AI will help decision makers and reviewers to understand important AI-specific details of an intervention, and any implications for the EE methods used and cost-effectiveness conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nModerately-structured and ill-structured case problems afforded more considerations of AI integration.\nâ¢\nTeachers generated more new ideas or used ideas from the PD in discussing moderately structured and ill-structured case problems.\nâ¢\nTeachersâ self-reported AI literacy improved after the case-based AI PD.\nâ¢\nModel cases should be provided first in AI PD before solving ill-structured case problems.\nAbstract\nIntegrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching practices is increasingly vital for preparing students for a technology-centric future. This study examined the influence of a case-based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well-structured to ill-structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachersâ reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem-solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video-recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem-solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co-construction, and dealing with ill-structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachersâ AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case-based discussions in AI-related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively. The research has implications for using a case-based learning approach during short-term PD initiatives and advocates the ongoing need for comprehensive AI literacy development to facilitate teachersâ AI integration in subject-specific teaching.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (254KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Existing design principles for ethical, safe and trustworthy AI tend to be highly abstract and focus on AI systems in isolation. They have rarely considered the adverse effects on safety that may emerge from interactions between AI and other technical components. Organisational theories of safety take such emergent outcomes of interactions between entities in socio-technical systems into account. They offer guidance on how to identify structural vulnerabilities in socio-technical systems enhanced by AI, and how to organise the design and operation of such systems for safety. In this paper, which is the result of a collaboration between sociologists and computer scientists (AI consultants), we conduct an analysis that can support the process of designing AI-enhanced autonomous systems in order to avoid structural vulnerabilities. It builds on organisational theories of safety and derives five key descriptors from them, the examination of which can guide the design of AI-enhanced systems. We demonstrate the utility of the descriptors by applying them to proposals for AI-enhanced critical functions in advanced microgrids. We discuss these proposals from the research literature on microgrids and review their effects on structural vulnerabilities. We then explore the implications that go beyond the example of advanced microgrids and propose steps for reviewing and reflecting on structural vulnerabilities that AI controllers may introduce into socio-technical systems.",

A daily diary study over five days was conducted among university students, distinguishing between inter-individual (between-person) and intra-individual (within-person) variations. Multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. In Study 1 (N = 72), results indicated that AI chatbot anxiety was associated with perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU), which serially mediated the link with AI chatbot usage intensity. Study 2 (N = 153) supported these findings and further explored the roles of facilitating conditions and subjective norm as additional predictors of PEOU and PU. Results from both studies demonstrated that, at the between-person level, students with higher average levels of PEOU and PU reported more intensive AI chatbot usage. In Study 1, the relationship between PEOU and usage intensity was mediated through PU at the within-person level, while the mediation model was not supported in Study 2. Post-hoc comparisons highlighted much higher variability in PEOU and PU in Study 1 compared to Study 2. The results have practical implications for enhancing AI chatbot adoption in educational settings. Emphasizing user-friendly interfaces, reducing AI-related anxiety, providing robust technical support, and leveraging peer influence may enhance the usage intensity of AI chatbots. This study underscores the necessity of considering both stable individual differences and dynamic daily influences to better understand AI chatbot usage patterns among students.",

Based on these variables, we identify three meaningful student groups, which can guide educational initiatives. We recruited 1,465 undergraduate and graduate students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany and measured their AI self-efficacy, AI literacy, interest in AI, attitudes towards AI, and AI use. Using a path model, we examine the correlations and paths among these variables. Results reveal that AI usage and positive attitudes significantly predict interest in AI, which in turn and together with AI literacy, enhances AI self-efficacy. Moreover, using Gaussian Mixture Models, we identify three stable and distinct groups of students: 'AI Advocates,' 'Cautious Critics,' and 'Pragmatic Observers,' each exhibiting unique patterns of AI-related cognitive, affective, and behavioral traits. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of educational strategies that not only focus on AI literacy but also aim to foster students' attitudes, usage, and interest to effectively promote AI self-efficacy. Furthermore, we argue that educators who aim to design inclusive AI educational programs should take into account the distinct needs of different student groups identified here.",

This study introduces a second-order scale for analyzing AI ethics and proposes a model to examine the intention to use AI caregiving robots. The model incorporates elements from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)âincluding social influence and performance expectancyâalongside AI ethics, self-efficacy, and trust in AI. The findings reveal that AI ethics and social influence enhance self-efficacy, which in turn increases trust in AI, performance expectancy, and the intention to use AI caregiving robots. Moreover, trust in AI and performance expectancy directly and positively influence the intention to adopt these robots. By incorporating AI ethics, the model provides a more comprehensive perspective, addressing dimensions often overlooked in conventional models. The proposed model is validated across diverse samples, demonstrating both its theoretical and practical significance in predicting AI usage intentions.",

AI significantly alters the interaction dynamics among students, teachers, and technology, necessitating the collaborative integration of AI in education instead of mere mechanical use. This study investigates pre-service teachers' perceptions and capabilities within the framework of social cognitive theory, focusing on their attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy, and AI literacy for effective AI integration. We discuss how these perceptions and capabilities help pre-service teachers prepare for the changing identities of being a teacher in AI-integrated education. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with a sample of 24 pre-service teachers suggests that (1) these pre-service teachers only use AI when warranted, (2) they need more understanding regarding AI fundamentals and ethics for AI's integration into education, and (3) they mechanically view AI as a tool to be utilized, rather than a dynamic collaborator in education. The findings indicate a need for more awareness of the possible changes in teachers' functions and roles in collaborative AI-integrated education, leading to specific teacher-training demands that aid them in success in AI-integrated education.",

These biases are found to hinder the identification of ethical issues in AI, the development of related ethical policies, and their application. This pervasive impact has been mostly neglected, giving rise to what is called here the heuristics gap in AI ethics. This heuristics gap is illustrated using the AI carbon footprint problem as an exemplary case. Psychological work on biases hampering climate warming mitigation actions is specialized to this problem, and novel extensions are proposed by considering heuristic mentalization strategies that one uses to design and interact with AI systems. To mitigate the effects of this heuristics gap, interventions on the design of ethical policies and suitable incentives for AI stakeholders are suggested. Finally, a checklist of questions helping one to investigate systematically this heuristics gap throughout the AI ethics pipeline is provided.",

While AI ethics has gained prominence in addressing broader societal concerns, existing regulations and guidelines often lack specificity for certain domain-specific applications (e.g. agri-food). AI is rapidly developed and deployed throughout the agri-food sector, but there is little practical guidance on how to do this responsibly. This study examines if the agri-food sector needs domain-specific guidance for the development and use of responsible AI and, if so, what it could look like. This research proposes it does and aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel approach for responsible AI in agri-food: the ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA) Scan. This assessment comprises 25 targeted questions aimed at identifying ELSA considerations. These questions were developed and based on 23 ELSA aspects of AI in agri-food literature and from testing in two case studies (arable and dairy farming). The ELSA Scan provides a clear and implementable approach for identifying ELSA in the development and use of AI in agri-food with AI developers and organisations.",

Synthesizing theories on regulatory focus and cognitive dissonance, we develop and test a model describing how organizational goals impact the dynamics of AI-based unethical pro-organizational behavior (UPB). First, we show that promotion-focused goals increase AI-based UPB and that RAI values act as a novel mediator. Promotion-focus goals significantly lower fairness in Study 1A and explainability in Study 1B, mediating the relationship between regulatory focus and AI-based UPB. Study 2A further supports RAI values as the driving mechanism of AI-based UPB using a moderation-by-processes design experiment. Study 2B provides evidence that AI-based UPB decisions can, in turn, lead to more unethical RAI values for promotion-focused firms, creating a negative RAI feedback loop within organizations. Our research provides theoretical implications and actionable insights for researchers, organizations, and policymakers seeking to improve the responsible use of AI.",

This paper investigates how AI is transforming entrepreneurship by reshaping traditional business paradigms and entrepreneursâ roles. It examines AI's influence on entrepreneurial decision-making, innovation, and identity. Through a comprehensive literature review and thematic analysis of previously published data, the research identifies emergent themes in AI's integration into entrepreneurial discourse. The findings indicate that AI enhances operational efficiency and decision-making but challenges traditional notions of entrepreneurial identity and creativity. Furthermore, entrepreneurs increasingly depend on AI for data-driven insights, strategic foresight, and personalised customer interactions, reshaping business strategies and competitive landscapes. This article emphasises the importance of AI literacy and adaptive strategies for entrepreneurs to leverage the human-AI dyad effectively while maintaining values and ethics. It also highlights the significance of concentrating research efforts on entrepreneurs as they are the very cohort to shape new norms and pioneer new business models and innovations. Future research should explore AI's long-term impacts on entrepreneurial ecosystems, including psychological, ethical, and socio-cultural dimensions, with comparative studies across industries and regions providing further insights.",

To what extent do observers believe that AI agents are responsible for their own actions? How do these AI agents' socio-psychological features affect observers' judgment of them when they transgress? With full factorial, between-participant designs, we presented participants with vignettes in which an AI agent contributed to a negative outcome either intentionally or unintentionally. We independently manipulated four features of the agent's mind: its adherence to moral values, autonomy, emotional self-awareness, and social connectedness. In Study 1 (N = 2012), AI agents that intentionally contributed to a negative outcome consistently received harsher judgments than AI agents that contributed unintentionally. For unintentional actions, socially connected AI agents received less harsh judgments than socially disconnected AI agents. In Studies 2a-c (N = 1507), these judgments were explained by ratings of the socially connected AI agent's âmindâ as less distinct from the mind of its programmers (Study 2b) and that this kind of agent also possessed less free will (Study 2c). We discuss the implications of these findings in advancing the field's understanding of the moral psychologyâand designâof AI agents.",

The initial study tested the utility of generative AI across diverse tasks and the significance of AI-related skills enhancement. The subsequent study explored interactions between humans and AI, analyzing emotional tone, sentence structure, and word choice. Our results indicate that incorporating AI can significantly improve organizational task performance in areas such as automation, support, creative endeavors, and innovation processes. We also observed that generative AI generally presents more positive sentiment, utilizes simpler language, and has a narrower vocabulary than human counterparts.

The emergence and widespread use of generative AI models present new challenges for public regulators aiming at implementing effective regulatory interventions. Generative AI operates on distinctive technological properties that require a comprehensive understanding prior to the deployment of pertinent regulation. This paper focuses on the recent case of the suspension of ChatGPT in Italy to explore the impact the specific technological fabric of generative AI has on the effectiveness of technology-neutral regulation. By drawing on the findings of an exploratory case study, this paper contributes to the understanding of the tensions between the specific technological features of generative AI and the effectiveness of a technology-neutral regulatory framework. The paper offers relevant implications to practice arguing that until this tension is effectively addressed, public regulatory interventions are likely to underachieve their intended objectives.",

First, we provide a thorough mapping of European regions focusing on the structural factorsâsuch as sectoral specialisation, R&D capacity, productivity and workforce skillsâthat may shape diffusion as well as economic and employment effects of AI. To capture these differences, we conduct a cluster analysis which group EU regions in four distinct clusters: high-tech service and capital centres, advanced manufacturing core, southern and eastern periphery. We then discuss potential employment implications of AI in these regions, arguing that while regions with strong innovation systems may experience employment gains as AI complements existing capabilities and production systems, others are likely to face structural barriers that could eventually exacerbate regional disparities in the EU, with peripheral areas losing further ground.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe question of how generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) will reshape communication is causing questions and concerns across the field of education, particular literacy and writing classrooms. Although important questions have surfaced surrounding the varied effects on writing instruction and ethical implications of AI in the classroom, there are calls for deeper investigations about how these tools might shape multimodal composing processes. This study builds upon this developing field by exploring how 21 university students in literacy education courses multimodally composed with generative AI and their perspectives on the use of AI in the classroom. Data sources included screen capture and video observations, design interviews, pre- and post- surveys, and multimodal products. Through qualitative and multimodal analysis, four main themes emerged for understanding preservice teachersâ multimodal composing processes: (1) composing was an iterative process of prompting guided by the AI tools, (2) composers exhibited two distinct processes when designing their projects, (3) AI shaped creative possibilities, and (4) play, humor, and surprise served a key function while composing. Preservice teachersâ perspectives also revealed insights into how AI shaped engagement with content, the importance of scaffolding AI in the classroom, and how ethics were intertwined with technical function and teaching beliefs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs organizations continue to embrace the use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is crucial to ensure that these AI systems can be trusted. However, there is still a significant gap between research on trustworthy AI and its implementation in real-world applications. To address this issue, we sought to explore the perspectives of AI developers and the challenges they face in creating trustworthy AI systems. This exploratory study involved conducting interviews with 19 AI developers. We identified key challenges faced by AI developers due to the immature state of trustworthy AI, inconsistent global regulatory landscape, a lack of standardized definitions of key concepts, limited tools and standards for practical implementation in organizations. This paper provides recommendations for organizations to invest in trustworthy AI processes and practices, this includes building a foundation for trustworthy AI specific to their organization, adopting an organizational approach to trustworthy AI culture, and providing proper data infrastructures to support AI developers in creating trustworthy AI systems. By investing in trustworthy AI practices, organizations can prepare for evolving regulations and ensure that their AI systems are reliable and trustworthy.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (222KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The study employed a research-creation approach and implemented a hands-on workshop, in which the participants engaged in a speculative design process using generative AI. The study focused on how participants, armed with their new tool, approached their designs, made design decisions, and interacted with the responsive tool. The qualitative analysis of the video data from students' project presentations employed thematic analysis, interpreting the students' responses in relational terms. The results revealed that the emerging human-technology relationships were primarily expressed through distributed decision-making, with the AI actively contributing both to the object of activity and to the emerging design process. The findings highlight that genAI is neither passive nor neutral tool but actively transforms both the design process and its outcomes, shaping how people experience new forms of agency in relation to such technology.",

As remote work continues to grow, organizations must adapt to ensure adequate performance and employee well-being. This study pioneered investigations of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing work engagement and well-being in remote work settings. Drawing on the socio-technical system (STS) theory, we examine the mediating effects of human-AI teaming, task-technology fit, and perceived e-leadership support on the relationship between AI digital assistant skills and employee well-being. Our quantitative study of 360 sampling subjects reveals a significant positive relationship between AI digital assistant skills and human-AI teaming, task-technology fit, and perceived e-leadership support. Furthermore, these variables significantly influence employee well-being, which in turn has a positive effect on work engagement. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing human aspects within AI adoption, advocating for a balanced approach that enhances organizational efficiency while promoting positive workforce outcomes. This study highlights the need to consider the human factor when implementing technology in remote work environments, emphasizing the importance of a people-centric approach to AI adoption.",

While the forms of human-machine interaction are becoming increasingly natural and naturalized, the impacts of such interactions for individuals and society are far from simple to grasp. As AI and Urban AI-related systems are being adopted by local governments and public authorities in support of public service delivery, it becomes increasingly important to involve communities in discussing impacts and working towards acceptable trade-offs in terms of the risks and benefits AI can represent to everyday life. Participation is often part of the discourse around policymaking and urban governance, yet the gap between decision-makers and city-makers within urban governance is not resolved. Besides, the barriers participatory processes hold to be accessible and inclusive stem now from lack of AI literacy and overall awareness on why and how participation can be a pillar of policymaking. We propose an urban governance framework for assessing the collective challenges of AI focused on people centeredness and public participation. Our contribution to the field of urban governance is a piloted framework designed and implemented in collaboration with city representatives, supra governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations and respective lessons learned.",

Considering the current integration of AI in work processes, the requirements for sales managers' interpersonal communication competence (ICC) are likely to be modified. However, research on sales management competencies is surprisingly scarce. This longitudinal case study investigates sales managers' perceptions of their ICC needs in leading AI-integrated sales teams in the financial sector. During the years 2019â2024, 35 expert interviews with sales managers were collected from one of Scandinavia's largest financial groups. The findings indicate that AI system integration brought benefits, concerns and communication challenges to sales managers' job content. The main components related to sales managers' ICC in leading AI-integrated sales teams encompass both traditional competencies (motivation, knowledge, communication skills, and adaptability) but also include contextual AI factors and a concern for ethical reflectivity. A component model of managerial interpersonal communication competence in AI-integrated teams (MICCAIT) is produced and its implications are examined. Given the greater reliance on technology, sales managers may increasingly need to place greater emphasis on their empathy and people-oriented skills for the human employees remaining in the workplace.",

This impact is likely to accelerate and become even more significant as the computational potential of generative AI grows through training on more diverse and more extensive language models and data sets. Emerging research in this new field suggests that previous models of understanding the interactions between machine and human may no longer be sufficient in a world of generative AI. The significant question is how emerging generative AI technologies will relate to and be a part of human creativity and creative outputs. In this article, we adopt a posthuman stance and conceive of creative output involving generative AI and humans in terms of a yet-to-be-fully-realised and emergent relationship that will likely become more integrated and complex. To investigate and experiment with this relational notion, each of us (as part of an autoethnographic approach) developed a creative output using ChatGPT: a poem and a multimodal narrative. We then employed the idea of alterity relations from the American philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, to conceive of the possibilities and limitations in working relationally and productively with generative AI. As two academics working in teacher education, we applied our learning from this exploration to possibilities in educational contexts. In this article, we offer several important implications and provocations for practitioners, researchers, educators and policymakers, not only in terms of practical concerns but also for rethinking the nature of the creative output.",

A comparative analysis of four companiesâtwo that have adopted AI and two that have notâreveals significant discrepancies in the management of TM processes between AI-driven and traditional companies.\nThe study employs the Delphi method to ascertain expert consensus on eight critical areas of AI governance, including data privacy, transparency, and ethical AI use. The findings indicate that companies integrating AI demonstrate enhanced decision-making capabilities, accelerated processing times, and enhanced stakeholder engagement. However, they also encounter challenges pertaining to ethical governance and regulatory compliance.\nThe research highlights the necessity of aligning the adoption of AI with the latest European directives, such as the AI Act and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to ensure both operational efficiency and adherence to ethical standards. The broader implications of the study underscore the necessity for pharmaceutical companies to develop robust governance frameworks, prioritize ethical considerations, and maintain regulatory compliance to fully leverage the potential of AI. Additionally, the study contributes to the ongoing scholarly discourse by providing empirical evidence on the interplay between AI, ethics, and governance, thereby encouraging further interdisciplinary research. This work emphasizes the critical role of strategic AI adoption in maintaining competitive advantage while safeguarding societal trust and adhering to legal requirements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nIn Autumn 2023, amendments to the Health and Care Professions Councils (HCPC) Standards of Proficiency for Radiographers were introduced requiring clinicians to demonstrate awareness of the principles of AI and deep learning technology, and its application to practiceâ (HCPC 2023; standard 12.25). With the rapid deployment of AI in departments, staff must be prepared to implement and utilise AI. AI readiness is crucial for adoption, with education as a key factor in overcoming fear and resistance. This survey aimed to assess the current understanding of AI among students and qualified staff in clinical practice.\nMethods\nA survey targeting radiographers (diagnostic and therapeutic), radiologists and students was conducted to gather demographic data and assess awareness of AI in clinical practice. Hosted online via JISC, the survey included both closed and open-ended questions and was launched in March 2023 at the European Congress of Radiology (ECR).\nResults\nA total of 136 responses were collected from participants across 25 countries and 5 continents. The majority were diagnostic radiographers 56.6 %, followed by students 27.2 %, dual-qualified 3.7 % and radiologists 2.9 %. Of the respondents, 30.1 % of respondents indicated that their highest level of qualification was a Bachelor's degree, 29.4 % stated that they are currently using AI in their role, whilst 27 % were unsure. Only 10.3 % had received formal AI training.\nConclusion\nThis study reveals significant gaps in training and understanding of AI among medical imaging staff. These findings will guide further research into AI education for medical imaging professionals.\nImplications for practice\nThis paper lays foundations for future qualitative studies on the provision of AI education for medical imaging professionals, helping to prepare the workforce for the evolving role of AI in medical imaging.",

Nevertheless, instances of notable AI failures have heightened ethical concerns, emphasising the imperative for local governments to approach the adoption of AI technologies in a responsible manner. While local government AI guidelines endeavour to incorporate characteristics of responsible innovation and technology (RIT), it remains essential to assess the extent to which these characteristics have been integrated into policy guidelines to facilitate more effective AI governance in the future. This study closely examines local government policy documents (n = 26) through the lens of RIT, employing directed content analysis with thematic data analysis software. The results reveal that: (a) Not all RIT characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) Participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (c) Adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (d) Many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. Furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible AI characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible AI practices. The study informs local government policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the critical aspects of responsible AI policymaking.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose:\nThis study aims to understand factors influencing consumer acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) voice assistants used in customer support within telecom companies in Jordan.\nMethodology:\nA survey was conducted involving 248 individuals who have experience with telecom support services. To evaluate consumer acceptance, the study incorporates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework and extends it with attributes specific to AI, such as Perceived Reliability, Voice Quality, and Quality of Information. Advanced statistical methods, including structural equation modeling with SPSS AMOS 28 and SmartPLS, were utilized to analyze the collected data.\nFindings:\nThe results revealed that Perceived Reliability and Quality of Information were significant predictors of AI voice assistant adoption in the telecom sector, while traditional factors such as Perceived Usefulness and Trust showed no significant impact. These findings suggest that performance-related elements play a more crucial role in user acceptance of AI in this context compared to earlier technological acceptance models.\nImplications:\nThe study offers an expansion to traditional technology acceptance models by highlighting the importance of AI-specific attributes over conventional factors like Perceived Usefulness and Trust. For telecom operators in developing markets, this research provides guidance on enhancing customer engagement with AI voice assistants. It suggests focusing on improving the reliability and quality of information provided by AI systems to boost user acceptance.\nOriginality/value:\nThe study provides valuable insights into the changing dynamics of consumer acceptance of AI in customer support, emphasizing a shift toward performance-based criteria. Telecom companies in Jordan can use these findings to inform their AI adoption strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs technology continues to reshape the educational landscape, understanding how autonomous engagement with AI-driven platforms influences second language (L2) acquisition is increasingly important. This study examined the impact of self-directed writing development through computer- and AI-based tasks on L2 writing outcomes, growth mindfulness, and grammatical knowledge. The research was conducted in three private English institutes in Ahvaz, Iran, involving 561 intermediate-level EFL learners that were selected using a convenience sampling method. Using a quasi-experimental design, participants were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG) of 276 students, which engaged in self-directed AI-based writing tasks, and a control group (CG) of 285 students, which followed traditional writing instruction. Quantitative data were gathered through pre- and post-tests measuring writing proficiency, growth mindfulness, and grammatical accuracy. Additionally, qualitative data were collected through interviews and questionnaires administered to the EG to assess their attitudes toward AI-based learning. The results indicated that the EG significantly outperformed the CG in writing outcomes and grammatical accuracy. Moreover, the EG demonstrated greater growth in mindfulness, with participants showing increased awareness of their writing processes and enhanced self-regulation strategies. Interviews and questionnaires revealed that participants in the EG held positive attitudes toward AI-based tasks, emphasizing increased engagement, autonomy, enjoyment, motivation, personalized learning, critical thinking, self-efficacy, time management, and collaboration in their English learning development. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based tasks in fostering both linguistic competence and metacognitive skills in L2 learners. The study provides valuable insights into the role of AI technologies in promoting independent learning and calls for further exploration of AI-based interventions in writing education.",

This case study examines an experiential exercise involving 118 postgraduate management students at a UK business school, where students were asked to write a 500-word reflection on their use of AI for a 2500-word essay-style assessment. Using sensemaking as a theoretical lens, we compare students' claims with assessors' evaluations of students' AI usage. Our findings indicate that students predominantly use generative AI for writing, paraphrasing, and rephrasing, rather than for fostering critical thinking or engaging in the more advanced stages of sensemaking, a level achieved by only one-tenth of the cohort. The consistency between this study's findings and pre-generative AI research suggests that higher education has yet to adapt adequately in ways to integrate AI to mitigate, rather than exacerbate, current sector deficiencies. We call on university leaders to develop institutional strategies that allow for effective and responsible integration of generative AI, and on educators to develop students' critical evaluation and academic writing skills that build on generative AI's affordances, with several specific recommendations made in this article.",

The study uses a mixed methods design to gather data from 50 English, Translation, and Linguistics faculty members at Ha'il University whose collective and individual views on the ethical and pedagogical issues are analyzed using a questionnaire and individual interviews. Results indicate an overall high perception (M = 3.49, Std = 0.808) among the teachers towards the ethical use of AI in their teaching experience and (M = 3.84, Std = 0.833), on the pedagogical implications of AI in the learning process. Findings also indicate that educators are aware of solutions to ensure maintenance of ethics with inclusion of AI in teaching, including training students on the use of AI, regulating the learning environment, using AI-based plagiarism detector and reformulating the assessment systems. They also report pedagogical considerations that help in the integration of AI tools in the EFL classroom. The study concludes with recommending that both EFL instructors and students be aware about the ways and need to ensure safer use of AI in the learning process.",

To cope with this quick and uncertain environment, firms need to be flexible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) are must for manufacturing firms to achieve the flexibility in procurement to manufacturing to marketing. This study explores role of AI-BDA played between Supply Chain Flexibility (SCF) and Supply chain firms performance(SCFP) through six hypothesis. A sample data of 297 responses from forty Indian manufacturing firms were collected. Exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis were used to analyse the collected data. Out of six hypothesis, four hypothesis are supported. The results show positive impact of AI, BDA and SCF on supply chain firm performance. Also AI positively impacts on BDA. However two hypothesis not supported are positive effect of AI and BDA on SCF needs further investigated. The study can guide decision makers to understand role of AI and BDA to improve supply chain performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) defense model aims to assist subject matter experts in planning, identifying, and executing against cyber intrusion activity, by outlining seven stages required for adversaries to execute an attack. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have empowered adversaries to execute sophisticated attacks to exploit system vulnerabilities. As a result, it is essential to consider how AI-based tools change the cyber threat landscape and affect the current standard CKC model. Thus, this study examines and categorizes how attackers use AI-based tools, and offers potential defense mechanisms. We conducted a systematic literature review of 62 papers published between 2013 and 2023 from the Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. Our findings indicate that AI-based tools are used most effectively in the initial stages of cyberattacks. However, we find that current defense tools are not designed to counter these sophisticated attacks during these stages. Thus, we provide insights to 1) highlight the changing threat landscape due to AI and 2) to guide the development of cyber defense mechanisms.",

The study addresses the gap in practical guidance for incorporating AI literacy by developing and implementing a 10-week AI-integrated EAP module at a pathway college in Scotland based on a novel framework termed AI for Academic Purposes (AIAP). Utilising a mixed-methods approach, the research investigates the impact of this module on international students' attitudes, confidence, and purposes of using AI tools. Results of this study indicate significant improvements in students' ability to critically evaluate GenAI output, confidence in using a greater variety of AI tools, understanding of ethical AI use, and an expansion in the purposes for which students use AI tools. The integration of AI literacy with traditional EAP skills was found to meet students' academic needs effectively. This study provides a replicable model for integrating AI literacy into EAP courses, offering a holistic educational approach that aligns technological proficiency with ethical awareness.",

The current work tends to center adult-oriented, adult-generated, and issues-based conceptions of ethics. This paper reports on an alternative model for âdoing ethicsâ via co-design with young people, highlighting the need for students to engage in AI ethics work, especially as AI is increasingly used in their education and social lives. In particular, we focus on developing a rights-based approach, using the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights as a starting point for redesigning core AI ethics principles and their conveyance to be accessible and relevant to young people, in collaboration with young people. In this manuscript, we describe our empirical work in a series of three studies on AI ethics teaching and learning with middle and high school students, which culminated in redesigning pieces of the AI Bill of Rights. We present lessons learned, implications for responsible AI in education from student perspectives, and conclude with our suggested principles for integrating student insight and perspectives into the ethics frameworks that guide AI applications.",

The incorporation of AI capabilities in the military holds the potential for significant strategic advantages in information and decision supremacy. However, AI also brings novel risks and safety considerations that existing certification processes are inadequate to address. Consequently, the need arises for the establishment of an entirely new certification framework, encompassing requirements and standardized processes tailored to the unique demands of AI safe-ty. During the development of such framework, the 7 High Level Requirements of the EU AI High Level Experts Group are taken as reference to develop the successive horizontal (cross-domain) and vertical (domain-specific) standards that would produce legal, robust and ethical AI. To facilitate the creation of a new AI certification framework in military aviation, a review has been done over traditional civil and military certification processes and the current AI certification progress under development, to present an overview of the key elements and processes involved. References from various levels (regulatory, industry, research) have been considered to provide an introduction to the prospective military AI certification framework.",

In particular, the aspect of information quantifiability could influence trust and dependence, especially considering that human and AI support may have varying strengths in assessing criteria that differ in their quantifiability. To investigate the effect of information quantifiability we conducted an online experiment (\n) with a 2 (support agent: AI vs. human)\n2 (quantifiability: low vs. high) between-subjects design, using a simulated recruitment task. The support agent was manipulated via framing, while quantifiability was manipulated by the evaluation criteria in the recruitment paradigm. The analysis revealed higher trust for human over AI support. Moreover, trust was higher in the low than in the high quantifiability condition. Counterintuitively, participants rated the applicants as less qualified than their support agentâs rating, especially noticeable in the low quantifiability condition. Besides reinforcing earlier findings showing higher trust towards human experts than towards AI and showcasing the importance of information quantifiability, the present study also raises questions concerning the perceived leniency of support agents and its impact on trust and behavior.",

A novel survey instrument was devised, validated and administered to 1600 employees in independent hotels across the United States. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses derived from a conceptual framework. The results confirmed that employee readiness and acceptance of AI significantly affects AI and SDG adoption, and also positively impacted NFP metrics such as employee optimism, satisfaction and engagement. The study finds evidence of a pathway from employee engagement with AI to greater SDG adoption, and in turn, enhanced NFP. This highlights the significance of leveraging employee attitudes toward AI for more sustainable and effective performance in the hospitality sector.",

By employing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Activity Theory, the research provides a robust analytical framework to examine the factors influencing lecturers' adoption of generative AI. The study is particularly relevant as generative AI offers significant potential to improve teaching efficiency and content personalization, yet its adoption presents challenges in aligning outputs with educational standards and maintaining meaningful teacher-student interaction. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from reflective compositions, where lecturers critically evaluated their experiences with generative AI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that performance expectancy and social influence significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention, while effort expectancy had no significant effect. Facilitating conditions, unexpectedly, negatively impacted behavioral intention, likely due to satisfaction with existing resources reducing the perceived necessity for new tools. A strong positive correlation between behavioral intention and actual use behavior demonstrated the critical role of intention in driving adoption. Thematic analysis provided further depth by emphasizing both the benefits and challenges of generative AI, accentuating the importance of balancing its use with human instruction to ensure quality teaching and interaction. The study stresses the need for the strategic integration of generative AI, offering practical and theoretical insights into its adoption and implications for advancing EFL teaching in higher education.",

AI specialists from computer engineering and closely related fields, as well as CCOs, communication directors/managers, public affairs officers, and CEOs participated in this research, explaining and assessing the role of ethics in AI. Through numerous points of data collection, the topic of AI ethics in public relations was examined through a mixed method approach. This study offers insight into the ethics and design of AI systems that communication professionals must not only use in practice but also understand, advise upon, ethically oversee, and occasionally defend in the public sphere when used (or commissioned) by our organizations. After a review of broad literature and longitudinal data from hundreds of sources, recommendations for a more robust framework for AI ethics in public relations are proposed. Ethical considerations and quantum and neuromorphic computing are posed as means to avoid technocracy, and base use of these advanced systems on moral values.",

This study examines the comparative effectiveness of AI-generated ideation and traditional expert workshops. In collaboration with BSH Home Appliances Group (BSH), ideas were generated and evaluated using both expert-based and AI-based methods in the context of sustainable packaging. The main quantitative analysis focuses on the quality dimensions of novelty, value, and feasibility. The results indicate that GenAI models such as ChatGPT not only match, but also occasionally outperform, those generated by expert sessions in terms of generating highly novel ideas. However, this increased novelty comes with a trade-off in perceived feasibility, highlighting a critical balance that must be managed in innovation efforts. A complementary qualitative analysis provides insights into potential barriers to integrating AI into ideation at the personal and organizational levels. Depending on the innovation setting, AI-based idea stimulation may limit the creativity and motivation of experts. Therefore, the form of AI integration should be adapted to the company's innovation context and should contribute to organizational learning. On the basis of these findings, guidelines are provided on how to effectively apply, and benefit from the use of, AI as a non-human intermediary to enhance the ideation process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe widespread popularity of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots has sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly regarding their impact on academic integrity among students. While several studies have examined AI's role in education, a significant gap remains concerning how AI chatbot usage affects studentsâ perceptions of academic integrity. This study aims to address this gap through rigorous quantitative techniques to explore the dynamics of student interactions with AI chatbots and assess whether this engagement diminishes academic integrity in higher education. Using a non-experimental design, the research investigates the causal relationship between AI chatbot usage and academic integrity, focusing on eight latent variables identified in the literature. A stratified sampling technique was employed to collect a representative sample of 594 participants via a 5-point Likert scale survey from four Southern Asian countries. The dataset underwent extensive statistical analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques. The findings establish significant links between motivations for using AI chatbots and a decline in academic integrity. The study identifies a behavioral link between academic integrity and pedagogical limitations, highlighting traditional classroom-based pedagogy as the most impactful factor influencing studentsâ motivation to engage with AI chatbots. This research not only quantitatively addresses ethical concerns related to AI in academia but also offers insights into user behavior by assigning distinct weights to post-usage behavioral factors, differentiating it from earlier studies that treated these factors equally.",

The first purpose of the current study is to advance the measurement of AI literacy by collecting evidence regarding the validity of the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) by Carolus and colleagues published in 2023: a self-assessment instrument for AI literacy and additional psychological competencies conducive for the use of AI. For this purpose, we first formulated the intended measurement purposes of the MAILS. In a second step, we derived empirically testable axioms and subaxioms from the purposes. We tested them in several already published and newly collected data sets. The results are presented in the form of three different empirical studies. We found overall evidence for the validity of the MAILS with some unexpected findings that require further research. We discuss the results for each study individually and also together. Also, avenues for future research are discussed. The study's second purpose is to develop a short version (10 items) of the original instrument (34 items). It was possible to find a selection of ten items that represent the factors of the MAILS and show a good model fit when tested with confirmatory factor analysis. Further research will be needed to validate the short scale. This paper advances the knowledge about the validity and provides a short measure for AI literacy. However, more research will be necessary to further our understanding of the relationships between AI literacy and other constructs.",

In particular, it focuses on identifying features that are important to students when using AI during their studies. For this purpose, a choice-based conjoint experiment was conducted through a survey involving over 6300 participants from German universities. The results show that students attach particular importance to the degree of scientific rigor. The optimal package for an AI-based tool for studying includes the citation of reliable or truthful sources, the detection and correction of errors in the input, a comprehensive and detailed formulation of the output, no AI-caused hallucinations and transparency of the database. These characteristics differ only slightly in group-specific analyses.",

We examine individual-level antecedents of willingness to use Strong AI for improving human cognitive abilities. Two quantitative studies (N1 = 1446, N2 = 1090) reveal that gender and emotions have significant effects on the intention to use Strong AI for cognitive self-enhancement. Male (compared to female) participants demonstrate a higher willingness to use Strong AI for self-improvement. This difference can be explained partly by negative and independently by positive emotional reactions toward Strong AI. Neuroticism moderates the indirect effect via negative emotional reactions, such that sex differences in negative emotions diminish with higher levels of neuroticism. Our research findings provide first empirical evidence for demographic asymmetries regarding adoption intentions of Strong AI for cognitive self-improvement.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is growing recognition among researchers and stakeholders about the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on classroom instruction. As a crucial element in developing AI literacy, AI education in K-12 schools is increasingly gaining attention. However, most existing research on K-12 AI education relies on experiential methodologies and suffers from a lack of quantitative analysis based on extensive classroom data, hindering a comprehensive depiction of AI education's current state at these educational levels. To address this gap, this article employs the advanced semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create an intelligent analysis framework that identifies learning theories, pedagogical approaches, learning tools, and levels of AI literacy in AI classroom instruction. Compared with the results of manual analysis, analysis based on LLMs can achieve more than 90% consistency. Our findings, based on the analysis of 98 classroom instruction videos in central Chinese cities, reveal that current AI classroom instruction insufficiently foster AI literacy, with only 35.71% addressing higher-level skills such as evaluating and creating AI. AI ethics are even less commonly addressed, featured in just 5.1% of classroom instruction. We classified AI classroom instruction into three categories: conceptual (50%), heuristic (18.37%), and experimental (31.63%). Correlation analysis suggests a significant relationship between the adoption of pedagogical approaches and the development of advanced AI literacy. Specifically, integrating Project-based/Problem-based learning (PBL) with Collaborative learning appears effective in cultivating the capacity to evaluate and create AI.",

Employing the theory of elaboration likelihood, the current study presents an analytical framework for identifying factors and internal mechanisms of consumers' readiness to adopt AI chatbot recommendations. The authors evaluated the model employing questionnaire responses from 411 Chinese AI chatbot consumers. The findings of present study indicated that chatbot recommendation reliability and accuracy is positively related to AI technology trust and have negative effect on perceived self-threat. In addition, AI technology trust is positively related to intention to adopt chatbot decision whereas perceived self-threat negatively related to intention to adopt chatbot decision. The perceived dialogue strengthens the significant relationship between AI-tech trust and intention to adopt chatbot decision and weakens the negative relationship between perceived self-threat and intention to adopt AI chatbot decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study utilizes 3,682 full-time workers to examine perceptions of AI-induced job displacement risk and evaluate AI's potential complementary effects on labor. By distinguishing between these variables, the research identifies which worker characteristics and industries are most affected by AI. Employing an extended ordered probit model, the results show that those with higher perceived risks are mainly female, older, and more educated. Workers with frequent internet usage and remote work are more concerned about AI-induced job risks. Sector-wise, entry-level employees perceive the least risk, whereas manufacturing professionals and senior service sector employees are more apprehensive. Contrary to the mainstream assumption that AI causes unemployment, this study identifies a potential complementary effect on job tasks, suggesting that AI can enhance and support human labor rather than replace it. This inference is based on observed worker perceptions and the increased use of AI tools in tasks that complement human skills. Moreover, AI's integration contributes to sustainable practices and entrepreneurial opportunities, enhancing business innovation and environmental efficiency. Workers increasingly view AI as a value-added element in their jobs rather than a threat, particularly in sectors focusing on sustainable development and green technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUsing firm-level data from 15 European countries between 2011 and 2019, this paper examines the productivity effect associated with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), measured by patenting success in AI fields. By making advances in AI and expanding on their knowledge base, companies can optimise production tasks, and improve resource utilisation, ultimately leading to higher levels of efficiency. To investigate this, we develop a two-fold panel regression analysis estimated within a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework. First, we investigate whether firms that engage in AI innovation experience a productivity boost after developing the new technology, compared to similar firms which do not undertake AI innovation. To analyse this, we employ a novel event-analysis methodology that quantifies the effect of the treatment (AI innovation) on firm performance (productivity) using a Local Projections approach within the DiD setting. Second, we utilise a Distance-to-Frontier (DTF) regression framework in order to examine whether the productivity premium of AI is associated with a firmâs ability to absorb knowledge and learn from the technologies developed by market leaders. Our findings reveal that the productivity gains directly associated with AI are statistically significant and quantitatively important, ranging between 6.2 and 17% in the event analysis, and between 2.1 and 6% in the DTF framework. We also provide some evidence that the productivity benefits of AI might be greater for those firms further away from the frontier (between 0.3 and 0.7%). Our research demonstrates that Artificial Intelligence can play a crucial role in enhancing firm productivity in Europe, a result that is evident even in these early stages of the technologyâs life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThis study evaluated the artificial intelligence (AI) proficiency of obstetrics residents in clinical scenarios.\nâ¢\nThis study identified a gap between perceived and actual AI skills.\nâ¢\nThere is a need for AI literacy in medical education.\nâ¢\nStructured AI training programmes in obstetrics are proposed.\nâ¢\nThis study highlighted the role of AI in enhancing healthcare efficiency.\nAbstract\nIn line with the digital transformation trend in medical training, students may resort to artificial intelligence (AI) for learning. This study assessed the interaction between obstetrics residents and ChatGPT during clinically oriented summative evaluations related to acute hepatic steatosis of pregnancy, and their self-reported competencies in information technology (IT) and AI.\nThe participants in this semi-qualitative observational study were 14 obstetrics residents from two university hospitals. Studentsâ queries were categorized into three distinct types: third-party enquiries; search-engine-style queries; and GPT-centric prompts. Responses were compared against a standardized answer produced by ChatGPT with a Delphi-developed expert prompt. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to explore the relationship between AI/IT skills and response accuracy.\nThe study participants showed moderate IT proficiency but low AI proficiency. Interaction with ChatGPT regarding clinical signs of acute hepatic steatosis gravidarum revealed a preference for third-party questioning, resulting in only 21% accurate responses due to misinterpretation of medical acronyms. No correlation was found between AI response accuracy and the residentsâ self-assessed IT or AI skills, with most expressing dissatisfaction with their AI training. This study underlines the discrepancy between perceived and actual AI proficiency, highlighted by clinically inaccurate yet plausible AI responses â a manifestation of the âstochastic parrotâ phenomenon.\nThese findings advocate for the inclusion of structured AI literacy programmes in medical education, focusing on prompt engineering. These academic skills are essential to exploit AIâs potential in obstetrics and gynaecology. The ultimate aim is to optimize patient care in AI-augmented health care, and prevent misleading and unsafe knowledge acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe used deep learning methods to develop an AI model capable of autonomously delineating cancerous regions in digital pathology images (H&E-stained images). By using a transgenic brain tumor model derived from the TS13-64 brain tumor cell line, we digitized a total of 187 H&E-stained images and annotated the cancerous regions in these images to compile a dataset. A deep learning approach was executed through DEEP:PHI, which abstracts Python coding complexities, thereby simplifying the execution of AI training protocols for users. By employing the Image Crop with Mask technique and patch generation method, we not only maintained an appropriate data class balance but also overcame the challenge of limited computing resources. This approach enabled us to successfully develop an AI training model that autonomously segments cancerous areas. This AI model enables the provision of guiding images for determining cancerous areas with minimal assistance from neuropathologists. In addition, the high-quality, large dataset curated for training using the proposed approach contributes to the development of novel terahertz imaging-based AI cancer diagnosis technologies and accelerates technological advancements.",

Data were collected from employees of Saudi travel agencies, resulting in 1122 valid responses, which were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that AI positively impacts OS as well as the three IC dimensions. Additionally, HC, SC, and RC have a positive influence on OS. The study also reveals that these dimensions partially mediate the relationship between AI and OS. This study advances the literature by clarifying how AI-enabled capabilities are translated into sustainable outcomes within the tourism and hospitality sectors. The findings offer valuable insights for industry professionals aiming to harness AI technologies for sustainable transformation. The study also offers strategic recommendations for tourism and hospitality organizations to invest in enhancing their IC, thereby optimizing the sustainability advantages of AI integration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPrior research highlights the critical role of AI in enhancing second language (L2) learning. However, the factors that practically affect L2 learners to engage with AI resources are still underexplored. Given the widespread availability of digital devices among college students, they are particularly poised to benefit from AI-assisted L2 learning. As such, this study, grounded in an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), investigates the predictors of college L2 learners' actual use of AI tools, focusing on AI self-efficacy, AI-related anxiety, and their overall attitude toward AI. Data was gathered from 429 L2 learners at Chinese universities via an online questionnaire, utilizing four established scales. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24, the results indicate that AI self-efficacy could negatively affect AI anxiety, and positively influence both learners' attitude toward AI and their actual use of AI tools. Besides, AI anxiety negatively predicted the actual use of AI. Moreover, AI self-efficacy was a positive predictor of AI use through reducing AI anxiety, enhancing attitude toward AI, or a combination of both. This study also discusses the theoretical and pedagogical implications and suggests directions for future research.",

This paper explores the application of AI technologies in the retail sector, focusing on their potential to enhance decision-making processes by preventing major ethical risks inherent to them, such as the propagation of bias and systemsâ lack of explainability. Drawing on recent literature on AI ethics, this study proposes a methodological path for the design and the development of trustworthy, unbiased, and more explainable AI systems in the retail sector. Such framework grounds on European (EU) AI ethics principles and addresses the specific nuances of retail applications. To do this, we first examine the VRAI framework, a deep learning model used to analyse shopper interactions, people counting and re-identification, to highlight the critical need for transparency and fairness in AI operations. Second, the paper proposes actionable strategies for integrating high-level ethical guidelines into practical settings, and particularly, to mitigate biases leading to unfair outcomes in AI systems and improve their explainability. By doing so, the paper aims to show the key added value of embedding AI ethics requirements into AI practices and computer vision technology to truly promote technically and ethically robust AI in the retail domain.",

This study addresses one context in which AI might become a relevant tool for different purposes: German secondary education. This study therefore examines the extent to which STEM teachers in German secondary education assess the benefits but also the risks of ChatGPT and how this influences the future use of AI in an educational context. As part of a questionnaire study, 102 STEM teachers were investigated. The current and future use of ChatGPT and various teacher variables were recorded with questionnaires based on classifications of researchers as well as political institutions. Relationships between the variables were explored using a path model investigating hypotheses regarding the affect heuristic, perceived risks and benefits as well as effects on teaching quality. In general, AI is still used relatively rarely, but future usage expectations are high compared to current usage. Results further revealed that perceived competence and benefits of ChatGPT have a positive influence on the use and intention to use it. Perceived risks and concerns have no significant influence on the usefulness of ChatGPT in the classroom, indicating that STEM teachers use AI in the classroom despite potential concerns and perceived risks. Additionally, perceived benefits and risks are negatively associated with each other, indicating that teachers rely on an affect heuristic when judging the usefulness of AI technology in the classroom.",

This emphasises the importance of a balanced approach to the integration of AI that retains the essential human aspect of (FL) education.\nAbstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has gained acceptance in the field of education. Nevertheless, existing research on AI in education, particularly in foreign language (FL) learning and teaching, is notably limited in scope and depth. In the present study, we addressed this research gap by investigating social and computer science students' perceptions of the integration and use of AI-based technologies in education, focusing specifically on foreign language teaching. Using an online questionnaire, we analysed factors such as students' field of study, gender differences, and the type of AI used. The questionnaire included statements categorised into thematic clusters, with responses measured on a five-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis, including chi-square tests and Cohen's d, revealed that individuals studying computer science, males, and supporters of generative AI are more likely to use AI tools for educational purposes. They perceive fewer barriers to the integration of AI into FL education. Social science students and women are less likely to use AI tools in FL education and express scepticism about their potential to improve academic outcomes. They tend to be more critical or cautious regarding the role of AI in FL education. They view AI as a valuable tool that enhances the learning experience but, at the same time, recognise the irreplaceable role of human teachers. The study highlights the need for targeted educational initiatives to address gender and disciplinary gaps in AI adoption, promote informed discussions on AI in education, and develop balanced AI integration strategies to improve FL learning. These findings suggest educators and policymakers should implement comprehensive AI training programs and ethical guidelines for responsible AI use in (FL) education.",

In particular, Gen-AI text-to-image models allow people to easily create high-quality images possibly revolutionizing human creative practices. Despite their increasing use, however, the broader population's perceptions and understandings of Gen-AI-generated images remain understudied in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. This study investigates how individuals, including those unfamiliar with Gen-AI, perceive Gen-AI text-to-image (Stable Diffusion) outputs. Study findings reveal that participants appraise Gen-AI images based on their technical quality and fidelity in representing a subject, often experiencing them as either prototypical or strange: these experiences may raise awareness of societal biases and evoke unsettling feelings that extend to the Gen-AI itself. The study also uncovers several ârelationalâ strategies that participants employ to cope with concerns related to Gen-AI, contributing to the understanding of reactions to uncanny technology and the (de)humanization of intelligent agents. Moreover, the study offers design suggestions on how to use the anthropomorphizing of the text-to-image model as design material, and the Gen-AI images as support for critical design sessions.",

Drawing from the Diffusion of Innovation Theory and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as well as the literature on digital equality, this research attempts to unravel the dynamics of digital equality and trust in AI-empowered metaverses for various industry sectors. Three cross-sectional surveys (NTotal = 1086) examined US Internet users' intention to adopt metaverses for business, education, and workplaces. Structural equation models were estimated using Mplus 8.8. Study 1 indicates dynamic relationships among digital equality (commerce dimension), blockchain transparency, privacy concerns, and adoption intention. Study 2 shows dynamic associations among digital equality (educational, social, and political dimensions), digital adaptability, loneliness, and adoption intention. Study 3 demonstrates dynamic interconnections among digital equality (labor, government, and health dimensions), digital adaptability, identity threat, and adoption intention. Across three datasets, trust mediates the relationship between digital equality and adoption intention. Theoretical contributions to the emerging literature on decentralized finance (DeFi), AI-driven digital transformation, and AI-VR-convergence are discussed. DeFi businesses, enterprises, policy makers, educators, professional training providers, and workforce developers need to consider third-level digital (in)equality and digital adaptability in developing equitable, sustainable, and inclusive user experience (UX) in AI-empowered metaverses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThere has been a growing concern about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in urban environments. Scholars have highlighted the dual nature of AI, which can both enhance urban sustainability and pose significant privacy risks. The literature acknowledges that AI introduces specific challenges in urban contexts. However, there remains a gap in comprehensive sector-specific ethical frameworks tailored to the unique challenges posed by AI applications in cities. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a starting framework for the ethics of Urban AI applications, providing principles to guide responsible AI development and deployment in urban settings. The study employed a two-phase methodology: a content analysis of 100 AI ethics documents to develop a preliminary framework, followed by a survey of experts and stakeholders to validate and expand this framework by identifying urban-specific risks and ethical considerations. The developed ethical framework for Urban AI applications provides a starting point to pave the way for ethical and sustainable urban AI systems that enhance the quality of life for all city residents.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nConducted survey experiments to analyze public's attitude towards adopting AI in healthcare consultations.\nâ¢\nIntergrated both cognitive and emotional trust to understand public's interactions with AI.\nâ¢\nRevealed public's demand for personalization and carefulness in AI adoption.\nâ¢\nExplored trust formation and broaden the \"perception-belief-attitude-intention\" model in AI adoption.\nAbstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies, exemplified by health chatbots, are transforming the healthcare industry. Their widespread application has the potential to enhance decision-making efficiency, improve the quality of healthcare services, and reduce medical costs. While there is ongoing discussion about the opportunities and challenges brought by AI, more needs to be known about the public's attitude towards its use in the healthcare domain. Understanding public attitudes can help policymakers better grasp their needs and involve them in making decisions that benefit both technological development and social welfare. Therefore, this study presents evidence from two between-subjects experiments. This study aims to compare the public's adoption and trust levels in health advice provided by human vs. AI doctors and explore the potential effects of personalization and carefulness on the public's attitudes. Experimental designs adopt a trust-centered, cognitively and emotionally balanced perspective to study the public's intention to adopt AI. In Experiment 1, the experimental conditions involve the types of decision-makers providing online consultation advice, either AI or human doctors. In Experiment 2, the experimental conditions involve varying levels of perceived personalization and carefulness (high vs. low). A total of 734 participants took part in the study. They were randomly assigned to one of the intervention conditions and responded to manipulation checks after reading the materials. Using a seven-point Likert-type scale, participants rated their cognitive and emotional trust levels and intention to adopt the advice. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) is conducted to estimate the proposed theoretical perspective. Qualitative interviews on both real-world and AI-generated treatment recommendations further enriched the understanding of public perceptions.The results show that AI-generated advice is generally slightly less trusted and adopted by the public. However, a noticeable inclination towards AI-generated advice emerges when AI demonstrates proficiency in understanding individuals' health conditions and providing empathetic consultations. Further analyses confirm the mediating influence of emotional trust between cognitive trust and adoption intention. These findings provide deeper insights into the process of adoption and trust formation. Moreover, they offer guidance to digital healthcare providers, empowering them with the knowledge to co-design AI implementation strategies that cater to the public's expectations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTransitioning to college life while navigating the complexities of emerging adulthood can be stressful. In some instances, it may even lead to the onset of mental health problems or the exacerbation of existing issues. While therapeutic resources are typically available in tertiary educational contexts, social stigma may lead to service underutilization. Additionally, high student-to-therapist ratios can create bottlenecks to access when such services are sought. Offering an adjunct to traditional campus counseling services, AI chatbots can potentially address such issues. Chatbots can provide flexible, accessible, anonymous, and cost-effective first-line support, improving access and extending traditional treatment methodologies. This study evaluates college students' perceptions (N = 224) of an AI chatbot (Pi) designed to emulate supportive and empathetic interactions characterized by active listening. Participants blindly assessed transcripts from active listening interactions between a client and Pi versus interactions between a client and a human counselor/therapist. The results indicate that participants could not distinguish between the human-human and human-AI counseling transcripts, answering correctly only 47.5% of the time. Moreover, participants gave higher quality ratings to the human-AI counseling transcripts than the human-human ones. These findings provide tentative support for the user-acceptability of relational AI chatbots during the counseling process's early phases (active listening and problem exploration).",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe majority of AI literacy studies have designed and developed self-reported questionnaires to assess AI learning and understanding. These studies assessed students' perceived AI capability rather than AI literacy because self-perceptions are seldom an accurate account of true measures. International assessment programs that use objective measures to assess science, mathematical, digital, and computational literacy back up this argument. Furthermore, because AI education research is still in its infancy, the current definition of AI literacy in the literature may not meet the needs of young students. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test for school students within the interdisciplinary project known as AI4future. Engineering and education researchers created and selected 25 multiple-choice questions to accomplish this goal, and school teachers validated them while developing an AI curriculum for middle schools. 2390 students in grades 7 to 9 took the test. We used a Rasch model to investigate the discrimination, reliability, and validity of the items. The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items. They indicate the quality of the test items. The test enables AI education researchers and practitioners to appropriately evaluate their AI-related education interventions.",

Several trustworthy AI frameworks have been created by U.S. federal agencies and international organizations to outline the principles to which AI systems must adhere for their use to be considered responsible. Different trustworthy AI frameworks reflect the priorities and perspectives of different stakeholders, and there is no consensus on a single framework yet. We evaluate the leading frameworks and provide a holistic perspective on trustworthy AI values, allowing federal agencies to create agency-specific trustworthy AI strategies that account for unique institutional needs and priorities. We apply this approach to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an entity with largest health care system in US. Further, we contextualize our framework from the perspective of the federal government on how to leverage existing trustworthy AI frameworks to develop a set of guiding principles that can provide the foundation for an agency to design, develop, acquire, and use AI systems in a manner that simultaneously fosters trust and confidence and meets the requirements of established laws and regulations.",

This review synthesizes cutting-edge developments, methodologies, and applications of AI-ML-DL across key hydrological processes. By critically evaluating these techniques against traditional models, we highlight their superior ability to capture complex, nonlinear relationships and adapt to diverse environments. We further explore AI applications in precipitation forecasting, evapotranspiration estimation, groundwater dynamics, and extreme event prediction (floods, droughts, and compound events), showcasing their timely potential in addressing critical water-related challenges. A particular emphasis is placed on Explainable AI (XAI) and transfer learning as essential tools for improving model transparency and applicability, enabling broader stakeholder trust and cross-regional adaptability. The review also addresses persistent challenges, including data limitations, computational demands, and model interpretability, proposing solutions that integrate emerging technologies like quantum computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and interdisciplinary collaboration. This review charts a strategic course for future research and practice by bridging AI advancements with practical hydrological applications. Our findings highlight the importance of embracing AI-driven approaches for next-generation hydrological modeling and provide actionable understandings for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. As hydrology faces escalating challenges due to human-induced climate change and growing water demands, the continued evolution of AI-integrated models and innovations in data handling and stakeholder engagement will be imperative. In conclusion, the findings emphasize the critical role of AI-driven hydrological modeling in addressing global water challenges, including climate change adaptation, sustainable water resource management, and disaster risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nWe give an overview of AI literacy measures.\nâ¢\nTheir factorial structures were mostly confirmed.\nâ¢\nPA EFA identified four correlated latent dimensions across all instruments.\nAbstract\nComprehensive concepts of AI literacy (AIL) and valid measures are essential for research (e.g., intervention studies) and practice (e.g., personnel selection/development) alike. To date, several scales have been published, sharing standard features but differing in some aspects. We first aim to briefly overview instruments identified from unsystematic literature research in February 2023. We identified four scales and one collection of items. We describe the instruments and compare them. We identified common themes and overlaps in the instruments and developmental procedure. We also found differences regarding scale development procedures and latent dimensions. Following this literature research, we came to the conclusion that the literature on AI literacy measurement was fragmented, and little effort was undertaken to integrate different AI literacy conceptualizations. The second focus of this study is to test the factorial structures of existing AIL measurement instruments and identify latent dimensions of AIL across all instruments. We used robust maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analysis to test factorial structures in a joint survey of all AIL items in an English-speaking online sample (N=219). We found general support for all instruments' factorial structures with minor deviations from the original factorial structures for some of the instruments. In a second analysis step, to address the issue of fragmented research on AI literacy conceptualization and measurement, we used principal axis exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation to identify latent dimensions across all items. We found four correlated latent dimensions of AIL, which were mostly interpretable as the abilities to use and interact with AI, to design/program AI (incl. in-depth technical knowledge), to perform complex cognitive operations regarding AI (e.g., ethical considerations), and a common factor for the abilities to detect AI/differentiate between AI and humans and manage persuasive influences of AI (i.e., persuasion literacy). Our findings sort the multitude of AIL instruments and reveal four latent core dimensions of AIL. Thus, they contribute importantly to the conceptual understanding of AIL that has been fragmented so far.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of generative AI has been a major disruptive force in academia. Academics are concerned about its impact on student learning. Students can use generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, to complete many academic tasks on their behalf. This could lead to poor academic outcomes as students use ChatGPT to complete assessments, rather than engaging with the learning material. One particularly vulnerable academic activity is academic writing. This paper reports the results of an active learning intervention where ChatGPT was used by students to write an academic paper. The resultant papers were then analysed and critiqued by students to highlight the weaknesses of such AI-produced papers. The research used the Technology Acceptance Model to measure changing student perceptions about the usefulness and ease of use of ChatGPT in the creation of academic text. A statistical analysis indicates the intervention's impact on their behavioural intentions on using ChatGPT for academic writing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDrawing from AI classification experience and identity-based motivation frameworks, this research explores the impact of AI classification failures on consumersâ self-identification and examines how self-expression plays a crucial role in shaping these effects. Across five studies, this research reveals that AI classification failures can diminish consumersâ self-identification, increasing negative outcomes such as regret, defensive neurophysiological cues, and adverse downstream behaviors for service providers. Consistent with our identity-based account, the findings highlight that the detrimental impact of AI classification failures is more pronounced when consumers are motivated to utilize AI-recommended content for self-expression, and such effects are mitigated when these motives are not salient. This study offers important theoretical and managerial implications for the burgeoning field of service failures by shedding light on the nuanced impact of AI classification failures and their potentially detrimental effects. Finally, it provides managerial recommendations for recovering failures in AI classification experience.",

This study aimed to explore the views of those professionals who are now using AI tools.\nMethods\nA small-scale exploratory research process was employed, where qualitative data was obtained from five UK-based participants; all professionals working in medical imaging and radiotherapy who use AI in clinical practice. Five semi-structured interviews were conducted online. Verbatim transcription was performed using an open-source automatic speech recognition model. Conceptual content analysis was performed to analyse the data and identify common themes.\nResults\nParticipants spoke about the possibility of AI deskilling staff and changing their roles, they discussed issues around data protection and data sharing strategies, the important role of effective leadership of AI teams, and the seamless integration into workflows. Participants thought that the benefits of adopting AI were smoother clinical workflows, support for the workforce in decision-making, and enhanced patient safety/care. They also highlighted the need for tailored AI education/training, multidisciplinary teamwork and support.\nConclusion\nParticipants who are now using AI tools felt that clinical staff should be empowered to support AI implementation by adopting new and clearly defined roles and responsibilities. They suggest that attention to patient care and safety is a key to successful AI adoption. Despite the increasing adoption of AI, participants in the UK described a gap in knowledge with professionals still needing clear guidance, education and training regarding AI in preparation for more widespread adoption.\nRÃSUMÃ\nIntroduction\nL'intelligence artificielle (IA) a le potentiel de transformer l'imagerie mÃ©dicale et la radiothÃ©rapie, deux domaines dans lesquels l'utilisation des outils d'IA par les radiographes est en augmentation. Cette Ã©tude visait Ã  explorer les points de vue des professionnels qui utilisent actuellement des outils d'IA.\nMÃ©thodologie\nUn processus de recherche exploratoire Ã  petite Ã©chelle a Ã©tÃ© employÃ©, oÃ¹ des donnÃ©es qualitatives ont Ã©tÃ© obtenues auprÃ¨s de cinq participants basÃ©s au Royaume-Uni; tous sont des professionnels travaillant en imagerie mÃ©dicale et en radiothÃ©rapie qui utilisent l'IA dans la pratique clinique. Cinq entretiens semi-structurÃ©s ont Ã©tÃ© menÃ©s en ligne. La transcription verbatim a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e Ã  l'aide d'un modÃ¨le de reconnaissance automatique de la parole Ã  source ouverte. Une analyse conceptuelle du contenu a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©alisÃ©e pour analyser les donnÃ©es et identifier les thÃ¨mes communs.\nRÃ©sultats\nLes participants ont Ã©voquÃ© la possibilitÃ© que l'IA dÃ©qualifie le personnel et modifie son rÃ´le, et ont discutÃ© des questions relatives Ã  la protection des donnÃ©es et aux stratÃ©gies de partage des donnÃ©es, du rÃ´le important d'une direction efficace des Ã©quipes d'IA et de l'intÃ©gration transparente dans les flux de travail. Les participants ont estimÃ© que les avantages de l'adoption de l'IA Ã©taient des flux de travail cliniques plus fluides, le soutien du personnel dans la prise de dÃ©cision et l'amÃ©lioration de la sÃ©curitÃ©/des soins des patients. Ils ont Ã©galement soulignÃ© la nÃ©cessitÃ© d'une formation adaptÃ©e Ã  l'IA, d'un travail d'Ã©quipe multidisciplinaire et d'un soutien.\nConclusion\nLes participants qui utilisent actuellement des outils d'IA estiment que le personnel clinique devrait Ãªtre habilitÃ© Ã  soutenir la mise en Åuvre de l'IA en adoptant des rÃ´les et des responsabilitÃ©s nouveaux et clairement dÃ©finis. Ils suggÃ¨rent que l'attention portÃ©e aux soins et Ã  la sÃ©curitÃ© des patients est la clÃ© d'une adoption rÃ©ussie de l'IA. MalgrÃ© l'adoption croissante de l'IA, les participants britanniques ont dÃ©crit un manque de connaissances, les professionnels ayant encore besoin d'une orientation, d'une Ã©ducation et d'une formation claires en matiÃ¨re d'IA en vue d'une adoption plus gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©e.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prominent in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. However, research on the factors influencing learners' sustained engagement with AI-assisted learning is scarce. This study bridges this gap by investigating the impact of AI literacy, learner attitudes toward AI-assisted learning, and foreign language enjoyment (FLE) on Chinese EFL learners' continuance intention (CI) for AI-assisted EFL learning. A survey of 417 EFL learners was conducted, and structural equation modeling was utilized to elucidate the relationships between these variables. The findings reveal that AI literacy, learner attitudes, and FLE significantly predict the CI. Moreover, AI literacy indirectly influences CI by mediating learner attitudes and FLE. Finally, FLE mediates the relationship between learner attitudes and CI. The study verifies a sequential mediation model, providing new insights into EFL learners' cognitive and affective traits and extending current models on the continuance intention in AI-assisted EFL learning. The research underscores the necessity for educators and technology developers to consider learners' interests and feedback, which are crucial for the sustainable progress of AI-assisted EFL learning.",

The results show that past-positive, present-hedonistic, and future time perspectives impact individuals' privacy concerns and their recognition of AI's utilitarian and hedonic benefits. Conversely, past-negative and present-fatalistic perspectives show negligible effects. The study highlights distinct patterns in credence versus experience services, with future-oriented and present-hedonistic individuals favoring AI's benefits in hospitals over restaurants, and past-positive individuals valuing hedonic benefits more in restaurant settings. These orientations affect perceived usefulness and ease of use, with privacy concerns significantly influencing ease of use. The findings offer significant theoretical and practical implications, underscoring the nuanced role of time perspectives in AI service robot acceptance across different environments.",

Given the data-, process-, and organizational structure-related requirements for effective implementation of such systems, these organizations encounter a major challenge in developing capabilities in this context. However, the existing literature has yet to unravel the organizational processes and practices associated with artificial intelligence (AI) capability development and deployment in industrial incumbent firms. The present study frames AI adoption in established industrial firms as a process of history-embedded, situated organizational learning involving explorative and exploitative learning. Based on a qualitative study of seven firms utilizing ML algorithms in their industrial and business processes, we develop a grounded model that explains AI capability building as both enabled and constrained by perceptual and functional triggers and barriers, leveraged via communicative and structural practices, and resulting in ongoing and interdependent processes of exploration and exploitation. The study contributes to the literature by showing how the convergence of organizational learning and AI technology's unique features promotes a distinct dynamic of AI capability building and deployment.",

However, its development is slowed by the absence of a tailored image database and explainable AI models. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop an explainable AI model that can not only diagnose ACDs but also present the basis for the diagnosis.\nMethods\nA dataset of 4942 slit-lamp images from 10 ophthalmological institutions across Japan were used as the image database. A sequential pipeline of segmentation AI was constructed to identify 12 clinical findings in 1038 images of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (AC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), and normal subjects. The performance of the pipeline was evaluated by determining its ability to obtain explainable results through the extraction of the findings. Its diagnostic accuracy was determined for 4 severity-based diagnosis classification of AC, AKC/VKC, GPC, and normal.\nResults\nSegmentation AI pipeline efficiently extracted crucial ACD indicators including conjunctival hyperemia, giant papillae, and shield ulcer, and offered interpretable insights. The AI pipeline diagnosis had a high diagnostic accuracy of 86.2%, and that of the board-certified ophthalmologists was 60.0%. The pipeline had a high classification performance, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.959 for AC, 0.905 for normal subjects, 0.847 for GPC, 0.829 for VKC, and 0.790 for AKC.\nConclusions\nAn explainable AI model created by a comprehensive image database can be used for diagnosing ACDs with high degree of accuracy.",

To address this limitation, we propose an AI-driven knowledge discovery framework known as genetic algorithm-geographic weighted regression. Through this framework, we have constructed an iterative optimization of knowledge generation and utilization. On the one hand, new explicit equations are discovered to describe the intricate relationship between precipitation patterns and terrain characteristics. Experiments have shown that the discovered equations demonstrate remarkable accuracy when applied to precipitation data, outperforming conventional empirical models. Notably, our research reveals that the parameters within these equations are dynamic, adapting to evolving climate patterns. On the other hand, these previously undisclosed equations have contributed new knowledge about terrain-precipitation relationships, which can be embedded into the AI model for better interpretability and climate projection accuracy. Specifically, the unveiled equations can enable fine-scale downscaling for precipitation predictions using low-resolution future climate data. This capability offers invaluable insights into the anticipated changes in precipitation patterns across diverse terrains under future climate scenarios, which enhances our ability to address the challenges posed by contemporary climate science.",

This study explores the adoption and impact of AI tools on an undergraduate research proposal assignment using a mixed-methods approach. From a sample of 187 students, 69 completed a survey, with 46 (67%) reporting the use of AI tools. AI-using students were significantly more likely to be higher-performing, with a pre-semester average GPA of 5.46 compared to 4.92 for non-users (7-point scale, p = .025). Most students used AI assistance for the highest-weighted components of the task, such as the research topic and methods section, using AI primarily for generating research ideas and gathering feedback. Regression analysis suggests that there was no statistically significant effect of AI use on student performance in the task, with the preferred regression specification estimating an effect size of less than 1 mark out of 100. The qualitative analysis identified six main themes of AI usage: idea generation, writing assistance, literature search, grammar checking, statistical analysis, and overall learning impact. These findings indicate that while AI tools are widely adopted, their impact on academic performance is neutral, suggesting a potential for integration into educational practices without compromising academic integrity.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe objective of this randomized controlled experiment was to evaluate the effect of delaying induction of ovulation and timed artificial insemination (TAI) on expression of estrus before AI and first service reproductive outcomes. A secondary objective was to evaluate the effects of delaying induction of ovulation in a Double-Ovsynch protocol on ovarian function. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 4,672) from 2 commercial dairy farms fitted with sensors for automated detection of estrus were synchronized with a Double-Ovsynch protocol up to the first PGF2Î± (PGF-L) of the Breeding-Ovsynch portion of the protocol (Pre-Ovsynch: GnRH, 7 d later PGF2Î±, 3 d later GnRH, 7 d later Breeding-Ovsynch: GnRH, 7 d later PGF2Î±, 1 d later PGF2Î±). At PGF-L, cows blocked by parity (primiparous vs. multiparous) and semen used for first service (sex-sorted dairy vs. conventional beef) were randomly assigned to the G56 (n = 2,338) or G80 (n = 2,334) treatments. Cows in G56 had 56 h whereas cows in G80 had 80 h from PGF-L to induction of ovulation with the last GnRH (GnRH2) before AI. For both treatments, TAI occurred â¼16 h after GnRH2. All cows with automated estrus alerts between PGF-L and TAI were inseminated at detected estrus (AIE) without GnRH. Ovarian function and responses to synchronization were monitored based on circulating concentrations of progesterone and examination of the ovaries by ultrasonography. Data for binary outcomes were analyzed by logistic and continuous outcomes with lineal regression. More cows in G80 received AIE and had estrus before AI. Overall, pregnancies per AI (P/AI) did not differ for the G80 and G56 treatments. Cows in G80 that received TAI and had no estrus had fewer P/AI than cows with estrus that received AIE or TAI in G80, and fewer P/AI than cows AIE and cows that received TAI and had or did not have estrus in the G56 treatment. No differences were observed between treatments or for cows with and without estrus for pregnancy loss. Unlike some minor differences between treatments for concentrations of progesterone at GnRH2, the most notable differences in ovarian function were for cows in both treatments with or without estrus that received TAI. Cows with estrus, were more likely to have follicles > 16 mm, had larger follicles before ovulation, and had a greater ovulation risk after AI. Likewise, within the G80 treatment only, cows with estrus that received AIE or TAI had larger follicles, were more likely to have complete luteal regression, had greater ovulation risk, were more likely to have a functional corpus luteum, and had more circulating progesterone after AI. We concluded that delaying induction of ovulation and TAI was effective for allowing more cows to express estrus before AI which had different ovarian function outcomes and greater P/AI than cows that did not express estrus. However, the greater P/AI of cows that expressed estrus was insufficient to compensate for the reduced P/AI of cows that did not express estrus, and thus increase overall P/AI compared with the treatment without delayed induction of ovulation. Detection of estrus before AI in cows undergoing synchronization of ovulation could help identify cows with different likelihoods of pregnancy after insemination.",

Moving away from seeing the user as the problem to recognising the user as part of the solution, our research reports on a novel cybersecurity intervention (comprising Explainable AI features, assisted remediation) designed to support users to identify, diagnose and mitigate cyber-attacks on the AI component of their smart devices. We carried out a case study of a bespoke smart heating device inclusive of this intervention and conducted fieldwork with ten households who experienced simulated integrity cyber-attacks over a month. Our research contributes an understanding of how to design AI-enabled devices and their ecosystems to support users to perceive integrity cyber-attacks, offering new considerations for intervention design that exploits multimodal indicators and supports users to troubleshoot themselves the causes as well as actions of cyber-attacks. Contributing to the growing area of human-centred cybersecurity, we evidence the distinctive challenges users face when evaluating integrity attacks on the AI component in the home context.",

These workers are sourced through digital labor (âcrowdworkâ) platforms that often are unregulated and offer low wages, raising concerns about labor standards in AI development. Using the results of a survey, this article aims to shed light on the experiences and perceptions of fair treatment among workers in the AI supply chain. The study reveals significant variability in workersâ experiences, identifies potential drivers of fairness, and highlights how design choices by labor platforms can significantly affect worker welfare. Drawing on lessons from physical supply chains, the article offers practical guidance to managers on how to enhance worker welfare within the AI supply chain and ensure that AI technologies are responsibly sourced.",

Utilizing dynamic capabilities and resource dependency theories, we provide a comprehensive and integral analysis of the drivers that facilitate AI adoption in SMEs. We conducted an empirical study encompassing 12,108 SMEs, based on survey data of the Flash Eurobarometer database from the European Union. Our analysis employed a combination of classical regression methods and advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and tree regression. Our findings highlight the importance of digital capabilities in driving AI adoption, where complementing innovation capabilities exhibit synergistic effects. Contrary to prevailing literature, business environmental support alone demonstrates limited impact, emphasizing its contingent effectiveness within a well-elaborated institutional framework. Furthermore, the synergy between business environmental support and digital and innovation capabilities has a significant impact on AI adoption in SMEs. However, internal capabilities exert a greater influence on AI adoption in SMEs compared to business environmental support. This study contributes to dynamic capabilities theory by elucidating the interplay of digital and innovation capabilities, offering a nuanced understanding of their combined influence on AI adoption. It also enriches resource dependency theory by highlighting the dynamic nature of business environmental support. For practitioners, our results underscore the need for a balanced investment in digital and innovation capabilities. Policymakers should consider these insights when designing support structures for SMEs, emphasizing a comprehensive approach to foster internal capabilities alongside creating an enabling external environment.",

Where AI performs productive tasks more efficiently than humans, organisations will benefit economically through increases in productivity. However, if AI is deployed to undertake unproductive, superfluous tasks, the efficiency benefits will be reduced, even if these tasks are performed more efficiently than a human could, because the said tasks are inefficient to begin with. We call this eventuality âefficient inefficiency.â\nWe outline several reasons why superfluous tasks are created by managers and why they persist in organisations, drawing on an array of behavioural, managerial, and sociological literature. We argue bounded rationality accounts for why managers often fail to identify superfluous tasks, coupled with organisational conflicts which often incentivise their creation. These factors impede the ability of organisations to avoid efficient inefficiency. Restructuring organisations to promote knowledge sharing and align stakeholder incentives may reduce, though not eliminate, the risk of efficient inefficiency.",

How has assessment of the impact on fundamental rights been framed by the EU legislator in the AI Act? What methodological criteria should be followed in developing the FRIA? These are the three main research questions that this article aims to address, through both legal analysis of the relevant provisions of the AI Act and discussion of various possible models for assessment of the impact of AI on fundamental rights.\nThe overall objective of this article is to fill existing gaps in the theoretical and methodological elaboration of the FRIA, as outlined in the AI Act. In order to facilitate the future work of EU and national bodies and AI operators in placing this key tool for human-centric and trustworthy AI at the heart of the EU approach to AI design and development, this article outlines the main building blocks of a model template for the FRIA. While this proposal is consistent with the rationale and scope of the AI Act, it is also applicable beyond the cases listed in Article 27 and can serve as a blueprint for other national and international regulatory initiatives to ensure that AI is fully consistent with human rights.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial Intelligence systems are used more and more nowadays, from the application of decision support systems to autonomous vehicles. Hence, the widespread use of AI systems in various fields raises concerns about their potential impact on human safety and autonomy, especially regarding fair decision-making. In our research, we primarily concentrate on aspects of non-discrimination, encompassing both group and individual fairness. Therefore, it must be ensured that decisions made by such systems are fair and unbiased. Although there are many different methods for bias mitigation, few of them meet existing legal requirements. Unclear legal frameworks further worsen this problem. To address this issue, this paper investigates current state-of-the-art methods for bias mitigation and contrasts them with the legal requirements, with the scope limited to the European Union and with a particular focus on the AI Act. Moreover, the paper initially examines state-of-the-art approaches to ensure AI fairness, and subsequently, outlines various fairness measures. Challenges of defining fairness and the need for a comprehensive legal methodology to address fairness in AI systems are discussed. The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on fairness in AI and highlights the importance of meeting legal requirements to ensure fairness and non-discrimination for all data subjects.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThis paper presents an analysis of literature exploring AI and related techniques in an accounting context from January 1990 to November 2023. It provides a comprehensive typology of accounting and AI research.\nâ¢\nIn doing so it sets out an agenda for future research.\nâ¢\nIt is one of the first applications of probabilistic topic modelling to accounting literature.\nAbstract\nHistorically, literature suggests that a variety of accounting roles will be replaced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies; however, in recent years there is a growing recognition that accounting can in fact harness AIâs potential to add value to organisations. Commentators have highlighted the need for increased research exploring accounting and AI and for accounting scholars to consider multi-disciplinary research in this area. This study uses a form of topic modelling to analyse literature exploring AI and related techniques in an accounting context. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used to enable probabilistic, machine-based interrogation of large volumes of literature. This study applies LDA to the abstracts of 930 peer-reviewed academic publications from a variety of disciplines to identify the most significant accounting and AI topics discussed in the literature during the period 1990 to 2023. Our findings suggest that prior literature reviews based on more traditional methodologies do not capture a comprehensive picture of accounting and AI research. Eleven topic clusters are identified which provide a comprehensive topology of the extant literature discussing accounting and AI and set out an agenda for future research designed to foster academic progress in the area. It also represents one of the first applications of probabilistic topic modelling to accounting literature.",

Using data collected through 20 semi-structured interviews with business managers and engineers involved in AI adoption for B2B marketing activities, as well as academic experts in the field of AI, this paper discusses how AI adoption priorities and motives shape the power dynamics amongst the various network actors, including focal firms, AI suppliers and tech giant companies. The findings show that, in the context of AI adoption in B2B, both technology and expertise are key sources of power, and that data creates and perpetuates power negotiations and renegotiations in the network. We envisage this process as the movements on a busy dancefloor where groups of actors are engaged in what we refer to as the Power Tango. This paper contributes to the power dependence theory by showing that, through the adoption process, network actors' power is exchanged, exercised, counter-balanced and perpetuated, creating fluid network dynamics.",

Given the recent increase in attention to AI technologies, this research explores consumers' preferences and intentions when products are framed as âsmartâ versus âAI-powered.â While previous literature has explored AI products and smart products individually, little is known about consumersâ preferences between the two products simultaneously. Three empirical experiments demonstrate that consumers show preference for products labeled as âsmartâ over those labeled as âAI-powered.â This preference is mediated by enhanced learning anxiety related to AI. The findings provide insights for marketers applying message framing, suggesting that labeling products as âsmartâ may evoke more favorable consumer behavior compared to the âAI-poweredâ label. Moreover, this research significantly contributes to the existing literature on perceptions and intentions related to AI and smart products by concurrently exploring consumer preferences regarding both smart products and AI-powered products.",

This study examines the intersection of cognitive processes and sociocultural contexts in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms, focusing on 79 learners enrolled in a compulsory EFL course at a Japanese university and their self-regulated use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Translate for writing tasks. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this study investigates learners' evolving perceptions and highlights the interplay between their cognitive engagement and sociocultural interactions within the classroom setting. Quantitative data from pre- and post-surveys reveal learnersâ attitudes towards AI-assisted writing, while qualitative insights are drawn from their self-reported experiences. Findings indicate that while the students perceived that their writing outcomes have improved by using AI tools for editing, the role of instructors for providing proper guidance and training on the technology, as well as the collocative learning with peers cannot be replaced by the AI tools.",

Two radiologists (R1, R2) measured total diameter (tD) and the longest solid diameter (sD) under each condition. The AI-based software automatically detected lung nodules, providing tD, sD, total volume (tV), and solid volume (sV).\nResults\nAll measurements by R1 and R2 with AI-based software were identical. Four out of the 8 measurements showed significant variation between R1 and R2. For LNM, multivariate logistic regression identified significant indicators including sD at mediastinum-2 of R1, sD at mediastinum-1 and mediastinum-2 of R2, tV, and the proportion of sV to tV (sV/tV) of AI-based software. For DFS, multivariate Cox regression identified sD at lung-1 of R1, the proportions of sD to tD at lung-2 of R1, sD at lung-2 and mediastinum-1 of R2, tV, and sV/tV of AI-based software as significant. For OS, multivariate Cox regression identified sD at lung-1 and mediastinum-2 of R1, tD at lung-2 of R2, sD at mediastinum-1 of R2, sV, and sV/tV of AI-based software as significant.\nConclusion\nRadiologistsâ CT measurements were significant predictors of LNM and prognosis, but variability existed among radiologists and display conditions. AI-based software can provide accurate and reproducible indicators for predicting LNM and prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSeveral reports in education have called for transforming physics learning environments by promoting sensemaking of real-world scenarios in light of curricular ideas. Recent advancements in Generative-Artificial Intelligence have garnered increasing traction in educators' community by virtue of its potential to transform STEM learning. In this exploratory study, we adopt a mixed-methods approach in comparatively examining student- and AI-generated responses to two different formats of a physics problem through the theoretical lenses of sensemaking and mechanistic reasoning. The student data is derived from think-aloud interviews of introductory students and the AI data comes from ChatGPT's (versions 3.5 and 4o) solutions collected using Zero shot approach. The results highlight AI responses to evidence most features of the two processes through well-structured solutions and student responses to effectively leverage representations in their solutions through iterative refinement of arguments. In other words, while AI responses reflect how physics is talked about, the student responses reflect how physics is practiced. Implications of these results in light of development and deployment of AI systems in physics pedagogy are discussed.",

This study focuses on source and message credibility evaluation as AI becomes incorporated into journalistic practices. An experiment (N = 269) explored the effects of news bylines and AI authorship on readersâ perceptions. The findings showed that perceived AI contribution, rather than the labeling of the AI role, predicted readersâ perceptions of the source and the content. When readers thought AI contributed more to a news article, they indicated lower message credibility and source credibility perceptions. Humanness perceptions fully mediated the relationships between perceived AI contribution and perceived message credibility and source credibility. This study yielded theoretical implications for understanding readersâ mental model of machine sourceness and practical implications for newsrooms toward ethical AI in news automation and production.",

These contained 115 cancers that were diagnosed within one year of a negative MRI. The model aimed to identify these cancers, with the goal of predicting cancer development up to one year in advance. The network was fine-tuned and tested with 10-fold cross-validation. Mean age of patients was 52 years (range, 18â88 years), with average follow-up of 4.3 years (range 1â12 years).\nResults\nThe AI detected cancers one year earlier with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (0.67â0.76). Retrospective analysis by a radiologist of the top 10% highest risk MRIs as ranked by the AI could have increased early detection by up to 30%. (35/115, CI:22.2â39.7%, 30% sensitivity). A radiologist identified a visual correlate to biopsy-proven cancers in 83 of prior-year MRIs (83/115, CI: 62.1â79.4%). The AI algorithm identified the anatomic region where cancer would be detected in 66 cases (66/115, CI:47.8â66.5%); with both agreeing in 54 cases (54/115, CI:%37.5â56.4%).\nConclusion\nThis novel AI-aided re-evaluation of \"benign\" breasts shows promise for improving early breast cancer detection with MRI. As datasets grow and image quality improves, this approach is expected to become even more impactful.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEfficient design, production, and optimization of new safe and sustainable by design materials for various industrial sectors is an on-going challenge for our society, poised to escalate in the future. Wood-based composite materials offer an attractive sustainable alternative to high impact materials such as glass and polymers and have been the focus of experimental research and development for years. Computational and AI-based materials design provides significant speed-up the development of these materials compared to traditional methods of development. However, reliable numerical models are essential for achieving this goal. The AI-TranspWood project, recently funded by the European Commission, has the ambition to develop such computational and AI-based tools in the context of transparent wood (TW), a promising composite with potential applications in various industrial fields. In this project we advance the development specifically by using an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven multiscale methodology.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (242KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nPathologist-read tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have showcased their predictive and prognostic potential for early and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but it is still subject to variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising approach toward eliminating variability and objectively automating TILs assessment. However, demonstrating robust analytical and prognostic validity is the key challenge currently preventing their integration into clinical workflows.\nMethods\nWe evaluated the impact of ten AI models on TILs scoring, emphasizing their distinctions in TILs analytical and prognostic validity. Several AI-based TILs scoring models (seven developed and three previously validated AI models) were tested in a retrospective analytical cohort and in an independent prospective cohort to compare prognostic validation against invasive disease-free survival endpoint with 4 years median follow-up. The development and analytical validity set consisted of diagnostic tissue slides of 79 women with surgically resected primary invasive TNBC tumors diagnosed between 2012 and 2016 from the Yale School of Medicine. An independent set comprising of 215 TNBC patients from Sweden diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, was used for testing prognostic validity.\nFindings\nA significant difference in analytical validity (Spearman's r = 0.63â0.73, p < 0.001) is highlighted across AI methodologies and training strategies. Interestingly, the prognostic performance of digital TILs is demonstrated for eight out of ten AI models, even less extensively trained ones, with similar and overlapping hazard ratios (HR) in the external validation cohort (Cox regression analysis based on IDFS-endpoint, HR = 0.40â0.47; p < 0.004).\nInterpretation\nThe demonstrated prognostic validity for most of the AI TIL models can be attributed to the intrinsic robustness of host anti-tumor immunity (measured by TILs) as a biomarker. However, the discrepancies between AI models should not be overlooked; rather, we believe that there is a critical need for an accessible, large, multi-centric dataset that will serve as a benchmark ensuring the comparability and reliability of different AI tools in clinical implementation.\nFunding\nNikos Tsiknakis is supported by the Swedish Research Council (Grant Number 2021-03061, Theodoros Foukakis).

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the context of greenhouse agriculture, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evaluated for its potential to enhance sustainability and crop production efficiency. This study reanalyzes publicly available datasets, using advanced time series analysis and noise reduction techniques through seasonality detection and removal. This novel approach reveals trends more clearly, providing a detailed comparison between AI-driven methods and traditional agricultural practices. An extensive review of literature on AI applications in agriculture is conducted to establish a broad understanding of its current state and future prospects. The core focus is the Autonomous Greenhouses Challenge, an initiative where research teams apply AI technologies in real-world greenhouse settings. This challenge offers crucial data for a thorough assessment of AIâs practical impact. The analysis reveals that AI significantly reduces heating energy consumption, indicating a notable improvement in energy efficiency. However, reductions in CO2 emissions, along with improvements in electricity and water usage, are only marginal when compared to traditional farming methods. Similarly, enhancements in crop quality and profitability achieved through AI are found to be on par with conventional techniques. These findings highlight the dual nature of AIâs impact in greenhouse agriculture: it shows significant promise in some areas, while its effectiveness in other key sustainability aspects remains limited. The study emphasizes the need for further research and investment in technological advancements, as well as the importance of a robust data infrastructure. It also highlights the necessity of education and training in AI technologies for effective implementation in the agricultural sector. The results of this research aim to inform policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders about the mixed impacts of AI on sustainable greenhouse farming. By offering a comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and challenges of AI integration, this study contributes to the ongoing discussion on sustainable agricultural practices and provides insights into the future direction of AI in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nKi-67 proliferative index (PI) scoring is measured by estimating the proportion of the number of active cell nuclei in hotspot regions within immunohistochemical (IHC) stained slides. It provides valuable information about the rate of proliferation in a tumour. Manual scoring of Ki-67 PI is laborious, time-consuming and often the victim of interobserver variability between pathologists. This motivated us to develop an AI-based method to automate Ki-67 PI scoring with the aim to improve the concordance of pathologists' inter-observability through aided diagnosis. We sourced 88 sequential cases of sarcomas for our study. We applied watershed algorithm to perform nuclear segmentation on 440 regions of interest (ROI). A study was conducted where three pathologists scored the Ki-67 PI on the ROIs with and without AI-assistance. Our study demonstrated great concordance between the pathologists scoring with AI-assistance. After AI assistance, inter-pathologist discordance was significantly reduced by 82.1 %\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (347KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This research systematically compares the performance of AI-generated to human-made marketing images across important marketing dimensions. First, we prompt seven state-of-the-art generative text-to-image models (DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, Firefly 2, Imagen 2, Imagine, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, and Realistic Vision) to create\nsynthetic marketing images, using\nreal-world, human-made images as input.\nhuman evaluations of these images show that AI-generated marketing imagery can surpass human-made images in quality, realism, and aesthetics. Second, we give identical creative briefings to commissioned human freelancers and the AI models, showing that the best synthetic images also excel in ad creativity, ad attitudes, and prompt following. Third, a field study with more than\nimpressions demonstrates that AI-generated banner ads can compete with professional human-made stock photography, achieving an up to\nhigher click-through rate than a human-made image. Collectively, our findings suggest that the paradigm shift brought about by generative AI can help advertisers produce marketing content not only faster and orders of magnitude cheaper but also at superhuman effectiveness levels with important implications for firms, consumers, and policymakers. To facilitate future research on AI-generated marketing imagery, we release GenImageNet that contains all of our synthetic images and their human ratings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe recent advances in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, along with the advent of generative AI, have led AI to become the ânew normalâ in organizations. This trend has extended to CRM, resulting in the development of AI-enabled CRM systems, or AI-CRM. Despite the growing adoption of AI as part of competitive strategies, many firms report minimal or no positive effect of AI on performance. This study addresses the research questions: âWhat are the critical features of AI-CRM systems?â and âHow do these features impact organizational competitive advantage?â To explore this, we aim to identify key characteristics of AI-CRM and assess their impact on organizational performance. In Study 1, we utilize BERTopic topic modeling to extract critical features of AI-CRM from user reviews. Study 2 employs PLS-SEM to examine how these features influence organizational competitive advantage. Study 1 reveals four main characteristics of AI-CRM (general, marketing, sales, and service/support), each comprising distinct features. Study 2 shows that these characteristics differentially impact CRM capability, significantly affecting performance and competitive advantage. The findings offer valuable insights for both theory and practice regarding the effective use of AI in organizations.",

Despite the need for new regulations, there is a mismatch between regulatory science and AI, preventing a consistent framework. A five-layer nested model for AI design and validation aims to address these issues and streamline AI application design and validation, improving fairness, trust, and AI adoption. This model aligns with regulations, addresses AI practitionersâ daily challenges, and offers prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying unique validity threats. We have three recommendations motivated by this model: (1) Authors should distinguish between layers when claiming contributions to clarify the specific areas in which the contribution is made and to avoid confusion; (2) authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions to ensure that the context and limitations of their AI system are clearly understood, (3) AI venues should promote thorough testing and validation of AI systems and their compliance with regulatory requirements.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (104KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

In this study, the authors used generative AI tools to develop four short teaching videos for a management course and then compared them with human-generated videos on the same subjects in an online experiment. In an across-subject experimental design, 447 participants completed two treatment conditions presenting different mixes of AI-generated and human-made videos. The participants were asked to rate their learning experiences after each video and had their learning outcomes tested in a multiple-choice exam at the end of the session (N = 1788 video treatments). The findings show that human-generated videos provided a statistically significant but small advantage to participants in terms of learning experience, indicating that the participants still prefer to be taught by human teachers. However, a comparison of exam results between the experimental groups implies that the participants eventually acquired knowledge about the content to a similar degree. Given these findings and the ease with which AI-generated teaching videos can be created, this study concludes that AI-generated teaching videos will likely proliferate.",

Thus, UNICA4EU worked towards a patient- centric approach to integrate AI in the care pathways for childhood cancer, with evidence-based patient advocacy at its core to build trust while protecting and guaranteeing patientsâ fundamental rights [1].\nThe task âIncrease Knowledge and Transparency about AI among patients, parents and survivorsâ was led by CCI Europe as the biggest pan-European childhood cancer parentsâ and survivorsâ organization which represents childhood cancer parentsÂ´ and survivorsÂ´ groups and other childhood cancer organizations and reunites 63 member-organizations in 34 countries [2].\nTo investigate the knowledge base of AI application in pediatric oncology among those who are affected, a survey was conducted. The survey translated into nine European languages, gathered responses from 332 individuals. To delve deeper into the survey findings, discussions were held with a diverse focus group, including four parents of childhood cancer former patients (survivors), three childhood cancer survivors, and one bereaved parent, each representing different backgrounds, age groups, and countries.\nInsights and outcomes of this study produced a report for guiding the multi-stakeholder board of the project when defining the governance structures reg. data sharing, ownership, protection, access and usage.\nPerspective of parents, patients and survivors of pediatric cancer regarding AI applications in Pediatric Oncology focused in six areas of interest including: data anonymization and data protection, data ownership, data withdrawal, ethical concerns of use of data, data types and, additionally, informed consents. This paper summarizes the respective results, along concluding policy recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nDespite notable advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) that enable complex systems to perform certain tasks more accurately than medical experts, the impact on patient-relevant outcomes remains uncertain. To address this gap, this systematic review assesses the benefits and harms associated with AI-related algorithmic decision-making (ADM) systems used by healthcare professionals, compared to standard care.\nMethods\nIn accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, we included interventional and observational studies published as peer-reviewed full-text articles that met the following criteria: human patients; interventions involving algorithmic decision-making systems, developed with and/or utilizing machine learning (ML); and outcomes describing patient-relevant benefits and harms that directly affect health and quality of life, such as mortality and morbidity. Studies that did not undergo preregistration, lacked a standard-of-care control, or pertained to systems that assist in the execution of actions (e.g., in robotics) were excluded. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar for studies published in the past decade up to 31 March 2024. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools, and reporting transparency with CONSORT-AI and TRIPOD-AI. Two researchers independently managed the processes and resolved conflicts through discussion. This review has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023412156) and the study protocol has been published.\nFindings\nOut of 2,582 records identified after deduplication, 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one cohort study met the inclusion criteria, covering specialties such as psychiatry, oncology, and internal medicine. Collectively, the studies included a median of 243 patients (IQR 124â828), with a median of 50.5% female participants (range 12.5â79.0, IQR 43.6â53.6) across intervention and control groups. Four studies were classified as having low risk of bias, seven showed some concerns, and another seven were assessed as having high or serious risk of bias. Reporting transparency varied considerably: six studies showed high compliance, four moderate, and five low compliance with CONSORT-AI or TRIPOD-AI. Twelve studies (63%) reported patient-relevant benefits. Of those with low risk of bias, interventions reduced length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit (10.3 vs. 13.0 days, p = 0.042; 6.3 vs. 8.4 days, p = 0.030), in-hospital mortality (9.0% vs. 21.3%, p = 0.018), and depression symptoms in non-complex cases (45.1% vs. 52.3%, p = 0.03). However, harms were frequently underreported, with only eight studies (42%) documenting adverse events. No study reported an increase in adverse events as a result of the interventions.\nInterpretation\nThe current evidence on AI-related ADM systems provides limited insights into patient-relevant outcomes. Our findings underscore the essential need for rigorous evaluations of clinical benefits, reinforced compliance with methodological standards, and balanced consideration of both benefits and harms to ensure meaningful integration into healthcare practice.\nFunding\nThis study did not receive any funding.",

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 54 participants (radiologists, radiological technologists, managers, hospital directors, and engineers), we examined how radiologists perceive AI and respond through job crafting behaviors and identity work. The findings reveal three categories of job crafting: approach, avoidance, and an emerging category of identity crafting, in which actors develop strategies to redefine their identity after the introduction of AI.

Prompt writing is the process of writing instructions for generative AI tools like ChatGPT to elicit desired outputs and there has been an upsurge of conversations about it on social media. To study this rhetorical activity, we build on four overlapping traditions of digital writing research in computers and composition that inform how we frame literacies, how we study social media rhetorics, how we engage iteratively and reflexively with methodologies and technologies, and how we blend computational methods with qualitative methods. Drawing on these four traditions, our paper shows our iterative research process through which we gathered and analyzed a dataset of 32,000 posts (formerly known as tweets) from X (formerly Twitter) about prompt writing posted between November 2022 to May 2023. We present five themes about these emerging AI literacy practices: (1) areas of communication impacted by prompt writing, (2) micro-literacy resources shared for prompt writing, (3) market rhetoric shaping prompt writing, (4) rhetorical characteristics of prompts, and (5) definitions of prompt writing. In discussing these themes and our methodologies, we highlight takeaways for digital writing teachers and researchers who are teaching and analyzing critical AI literacies.",

We have recently shown in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) that AI-CAC automated left atrial (LA) volumetry enabled prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) as early as 1 year.\nObjectives\nIn this study, the authors evaluated the performance of AI-CAC LA volumetry versus LA measured by human experts using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) for predicting incident AF and stroke and compared them with Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology model for atrial fibrillation (CHARGE-AF) risk score, Agatston score, and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).\nMethods\nWe used 15-year outcomes data from 3,552 asymptomatic individuals (52.2% women, age 61.7 Â± 10.2 years) who underwent both CAC scans and CMRI in the MESA baseline examination. CMRI LA volume was previously measured by human experts. Data on NT-proBNP, CHARGE-AF risk score, and the Agatston score were obtained from MESA. Discrimination was assessed using the time-dependent area under the curve.\nResults\nOver 15 years follow-up, 562 cases of AF and 140 cases of stroke accrued. The area under the curve for AI-CAC versus CMRI volumetry for AF (0.802 vs 0.798) and stroke (0.762 vs 0.751) were not significantly different. AI-CAC LA significantly improved the continuous net reclassification index for prediction of 5-year AF when added to CHARGE-AF risk score (0.23), NT-proBNP (0.37, 0.37), and Agatston score (0.44) (P for all <0.0001).\nConclusions\nAI-CAC automated LA volumetry and CMRI LA volume measured by human experts similarly predicted incident AF and stroke over 15 years. Further studies to investigate the clinical utility of AI-CAC for AF and stroke prediction are warranted.\nCentral Illustration\nDownload: Download high-res image (1MB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Despite substantial research and development investment in explainable AI, there is a lack of effort into making AI explainable and inclusive to people with cognitive disabilities as well. In this paper, we present the first steps towards this research topic. We argue that three main questions guide this research, namely: 1) How explainable should a system be?; 2) What level of understanding can the user reach, and what is the right type of explanation to help them reach this level?; and 3) How can we implement an AI system that can generate the necessary explanations? We present the current state of the art in research on these three topics, the current open questions and the next steps. Finally, we present the challenges specific to bringing these three research topics together, in order to eventually be able to answer the question of how to make AI systems explainable also to people with cognitive disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies on integrating AI in various educational contexts, ranging from early childhood to higher education. Although systematic reviews have widely reported the effects of AI on teaching and learning, limited reviews have examined and defined responsible AI in education (AIED). To fill this gap, we conducted a convergent systematic mixed studies review to analyze key themes emerging from primary research. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Scopus and Web of Science and identified 40 empirical studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria. Specifically, we used four criteria for the screening process: (1) the study's full text was available in English; (2) the study was published before April 10th, 2024 in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings; (3) the study was primary research that collected original data and applied qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods as the study methodology; and (4) the study had a clear focus on ethical and/or responsible AI in one or multiple educational context(s). Our findings identified essential stakeholders and characteristics of responsible AI in K-20 educational contexts and expanded understanding of responsible human-centered AI (HCAI). We unveiled characteristics vital to HCAI, encompassing Fairness and Equity, Privacy and Security, Non-maleficence and Beneficence, Agency and Autonomy, and Transparency and Intelligibility. In addition, we provided suggestions on how to achieve responsible HCAI via collaborative efforts of stakeholders, including roles of users (e.g., students and educators), developers, researchers, and policy and decision-makers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nLate gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables imaging of scar/fibrosis and is a cornerstone of most CMR imaging protocols. CMR imaging can benefit from image acceleration; however, image acceleration in LGE remains challenging due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we sought to evaluate a rapid 2D LGE imaging protocol using a generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm with inline reconstruction.\nMethods\nA generative AI-based image enhancement was used to improve the sharpness of 2D LGE images acquired with low spatial resolution in the phase-encode direction. The generative AI model is an image enhancement technique built on the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network. The model was trained using balanced steady-state free-precession cine images, readily used for LGE without additional training. The model was implemented inline, allowing the reconstruction of images on the scanner console. We prospectively enrolled 100 patients (55âÂ±â14 years, 72 males) referred for clinical CMR at 3 T. We collected three sets of LGE images in each subject, with in-plane spatial resolutions of 1.5Ã1.5-3-6 mm2. The generative AI model enhanced in-plane resolution to 1.5Ã1.5 mm2 from the low-resolution counterparts. Images were compared using a blur metric, quantifying the perceived image sharpness (0 = sharpest, 1=blurriest). LGE image sharpness (using a 5-point scale) was assessed by three independent readers.\nResults\nThe scan times for the three imaging sets were 15Â±3, 9Â±2, and 6Â±1 seconds, with inline generative AI-based images reconstructed time of ~37 ms. The generative-AI-based model improved visual image sharpness, resulting in lower blur metric than low-resolution counterparts (AI-enhanced from 1.5Ã3 mm2 resolution: 0.3Â±0.03 vs. 0.35Â±0.03, P<0.01). Meanwhile, AI-enhanced images from 1.5Ã3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images showed similar blur metric (0.30Â±0.03 vs. 0.31Â±0.03, P=1.0) Additionally, there was an overall 18% improvement in image sharpness between AI-enhanced images from 1.5Ã3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images in the subjective blurriness score (P<0.01).\nConclusions\nGenerative AI-based model enhances the image quality of 2D LGE images while reducing the scan time and preserving imaging sharpness. Further evaluation in a large cohort is needed to assess the clinical utility of AI-enhanced LGE images for scar evaluation, as this proof-of-concept study does not provide evidence of an impact on diagnosis.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (387KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4 enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Gemini AI in responding to clinical vignette questions regarding Hallux Rigidus, a condition requiring specialized knowledge in foot and ankle surgery. The ChatGPT-4 + RAG model, enhanced with the 2024 ACFAS clinical consensus statements, demonstrated the highest agreement with surveyor majority responses (83.26 %) compared to ChatGPT-4 (59.54 %) and Gemini AI (53.02 %). All models provided clinically appropriate responses to most questions, with the ChatGPT-4 + RAG model excelling in accuracy, despite the rationale for answers being deemed most difficult to read. These findings highlight the limitations of generic AI models, which may propagate misinformation if used by patients seeking health information. By incorporating domain-specific resources, the RAG-augmented model showed enhanced reliability and contextual accuracy, suggesting their potential as tools for both clinical decision-making and patient education. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating verified medical resources to advance AI in healthcare, addressing critical gaps in existing capabilities while minimizing risks of misinformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nRotator cuff tears (RCT) are common upper extremity injuries that significantly impair shoulder function, leading to pain, reduced range of motion, and a decrease in quality of life. With the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence large language models (AI LLMs) for health information, it is crucial to evaluate the quality and readability of the information provided by these models.\nMethods\nA pool of 50 questions were generated related to RCT by querying popular AI LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, Gemini, and Microsoft CoPilot) and using Google search. After that, responses from the AI LLMs were saved and evaluated. For information quality the DISCERN tool and a Likert Scale was used, for readability the PEMAT Understandability Score and the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Score was used. Two orthopedic surgeons assessed the responses, and discrepancies were resolved by a senior author.\nResults\nOut of 198 answers, the median DISCERN score was 40, with 56.6% considered sufficient. The Likert Scale showed 96% sufficiency. The median PEMAT Understandability score was 83.33, with 77.3% sufficiency, while the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score had a median of 42.05, with 88.9% sufficiency. Overall, 39.8% of the answers were sufficient in both information quality and readability. Differences were found among AI models in DISCERN, Likert, PEMAT Understandability, and Flesch-Kincaid scores.\nConclusion\nAI LLMs generally can not offer sufficient information quality and readability. While they are not ready for use in medical field, they show a promising future. There is a necessity for continuous re-evaluation of these models due to their rapid evolution. Developing new, comprehensive tools for evaluating medical information quality and readability is crucial for ensuring these models can effectively support patient education. Future research should focus on enhancing readability and consistent information quality to better serve patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstracts\nAlthough generative conversational artificial intelligence (AI) can answer questions well and hold conversations as a person, the semantic ambiguity inherent in text-based communication poses challenges to effective use. Effective use reflects the users' utilization of generative conversational AI to achieve their goals, which has not been previously studied. Drawing on the media naturalness theory, we examined how generative conversational AIâs content and style naturalness affect effective use. A two-wave survey was conducted to collect data from 565 users of generative conversational AI. Two techniques were used in this study. Initially, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to determine the variables that significantly affected the mechanisms (i.e., cognitive effort and communication ambiguity) and effective use. Secondly, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to evaluate the relative importance of the significant predictors of mechanisms and effective use identified from the PLS-SEM analysis. The results revealed that the naturalness of content and style differed in their effects on cognitive effort and communication ambiguity. Additionally, cognitive effort and communication ambiguity negatively affected effective use. This study advances the literature on effective use by uncovering the psychological mechanisms underlying effective use and their antecedents. In addition, this study offers insights into the design of generative conversational AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative AI (GenAI) use in research writing is growing fast. However, it is unclear how peer reviewers recognize or misjudge AI-augmented manuscripts. To investigate the impact of AI-augmented writing on peer reviews, we conducted a snippet-based online survey with 17 peer reviewers from top-tier HCI conferences. Our findings indicate that while AI-augmented writing improves readability, language diversity, and informativeness, it often lacks research details and reflective insights from authors. Reviewers consistently struggled to distinguish between human and AI-augmented writing but their judgements remained consistent. They noted the loss of a âhuman touchâ and subjective expressions in AI-augmented writing. Based on our findings, we advocate for reviewer guidelines that promote impartial evaluations of submissions, regardless of any personal biases towards GenAI. The quality of the research itself should remain a priority in reviews, regardless of any preconceived notions about the tools used to create it. We emphasize that researchers must maintain their authorship and control over the writing process, even when using GenAI's assistance.",

The median interval between coronary CTA and CMR was 22 days (IQR: 3-76 days). We utilized a no new UNet AI model that automatically segmented noncontrast CT structures. AI measurement of LV mass was compared to contrast CTA and CMR.\nResults\nA total of 316 patients (age: 57.1 Â± 16.7 years, 56% male) were included. The AI segmentation took on average 22 seconds per case. An excellent correlation was observed between AI and contrast CTA LV mass measures (r = 0.84, P < 0.001), with no significant differences (136.5 Â± 55.3 g vs 139.6 Â± 56.9 g, P = 0.133). Bland-Altman analysis showed minimal bias of 2.9. When compared to CMR, measured LV mass was higher with AI (136.5 Â± 55.3 g vs 127.1 Â± 53.1 g, P < 0.001). There was an excellent correlation between AI and CMR (r = 0.85, P < 0.001), with a small bias (â9.4). There were no statistical differences between the correlations of LV mass between contrast CTA and CMR or AI and CMR.\nConclusions\nThe AI-based automated estimation of LV mass from noncontrast CT demonstrated excellent correlations and minimal biases when compared to contrast CTA and CMR.\nCentral Illustration\nDownload: Download high-res image (1MB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

It presents a HumanâAI interaction paradigm that emphasizes explainability and user control of AI systems. It is an iterative negotiation process based on three interaction strategies aimed to (i) elaborate the system outcomes through iterative steps (Iterative Exploration), (ii) explain the AI systemâs behavior or decisions (Clarification), and (iii) allow non-expert users to trigger simple retraining of the AI model (Reconfiguration). This interaction paradigm is exploited in the redesign of an existing AI-based tool for microscopic analysis of the nasal mucosa. The resulting tool is tested with rhinocytologists. The article discusses the analysis of the results of the conducted evaluation and outlines lessons learned that are relevant for AI in medicine.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (317KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The study examined 32 papers, focusing on publication trends, tool types, research methods, learning outcomes, and factors influencing their use. Findings revealed a gradual increase in publications, with 4 (12%) from 2013 to 2021, 13 (41%) in 2022, and 15 (47%) in 2023. All studies (100%) were conducted in Asian EFL contexts. Among the AI chatbots, Google Assistant (25%) was the most widely used. Quasi-experimental (45%) and cross-section (41%) research designs were commonly employed. Mixed-method (50%) approaches were prevalent for data collection and analysis. Conversational AI yielded positive outcomes in affective (43%) and cognitive skills (41%). The main factors influencing user perceptions or behaviors were individual (47%) and microsystem layers (31%). Future studies should (a) include diverse contexts beyond Asia, (b) consider the use of up-to-date tools (e.g., ChatGPT), (c) employ rigorous experimental designs, (d) explore behavioral learning outcomes, and (e) investigate broader environmental factors. The systematic review enhances current knowledge of recent research trends, identifies environmental factors influencing conversational AI tools concentrating in ELT, and provides insights for future research and practice in this rapidly evolving field.",

This study meticulously reviewed the research themes, theoretical foundations, and methodological frameworks of the HAII field, aiming to construct a comprehensive overview of this field and provide robust support for future investigations. HAII research themes include human-AI collaboration, competition, conflict, and symbiosis. Theories drawn from communication, psychology, and sociology support these studies, while the employed methods include both self-reporting and observational approaches commonly utilized in user studies. It is suggested that future research should broaden its focus to encompass diverse user groups, AI roles, and tasks. Moreover, it is necessary to develop multi-disciplinary theories and integrate multi-level research methods to support the sustained development of the field. This study not only furnishes indispensable theoretical and practical insights for forthcoming research endeavors but also catalyzes the realization of a future distinguished by seamless interaction between humans and AI.",

This project aims to develop a state-of-the-art AI-based system for diagnosing Covid-19 pneumonia from Chest X-ray (CXR) images. The contributions of this work are manifold: the release of the public CORDA dataset, a deep learning pipeline for Covid-19 detection and prioritization, the clinical validation of the developed solution by expert radiologists, and an in-depth analysis of possible biases embedded in the data and in the models, in order to build more trust in our AI-based pipeline. The proposed detection model is based on a two-step approach that provides reliable results based on objective radiological findings. Our prioritization scheme ensures the ordering of the patients so that severe cases are presented first. We showcase the impact of our pipeline on radiologists' workflow with a clinical study, allowing us to assess the real benefits in terms of accuracy and time efficiency.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative AI applications have increasingly gained visibility in recent educational literature. Yet less is known about how access to generative tools, such as ChatGPT, influences help-seeking during complex problem-solving. In this paper, we aim to advance the understanding of learners' use of a support strategy (hints) when solving data science programming tasks in an online AI-enabled learning environment. The study compared two conditions: students solving problems in DaTu with AI assistance (N = 45) and those without AI assistance (N = 44). Findings reveal no difference in hint-seeking behavior between the two groups, suggesting that the integration of AI assistance has minimal impact on how individuals seek help. The findings also suggest that the availability of AI assistance does not necessarily reduce learnersâ reliance on support strategies (such as hints). The current study advances data science education and research by exploring the influence of AI assistance during complex data science problem-solving. We discuss implications and identify paths for future research.",

This study aims to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) and financial technology (FinTech) affect the exploitation of clean minerals in the pursuit of sustainable development. Employing wavelet analysis and quantile value-at-risk (QVaR), we provide a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic relationships, risks, and returns associated between clean minerals and these technological innovations. Our wavelet findings indicate that there are strong co-movements for aluminum, copper, and zinc with various clean and technological indices while nickel shows weak co-movements. Our QVaR results reveal significant differences in risk and return profiles across indices, underscoring the high-risk, high-reward nature of clean and technological sectors. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating AI and FinTech into regulatory frameworks and industry practices, advocating for a collaborative approach to leverage these technologies to influence the exploitation of clean minerals toward greater sustainability. Therefore, the novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive methodological approach to scrutinize the linkages between clean minerals and new-age technologies, with significant multi-stakeholder implications for policy and practice, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

It is well established that the level of acceptance of these materials influences learning outcomes, but there is lack of evidence regarding the use and related impact of videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) on these aspects. This paper used linear mixed models and path analysis to investigate the influence of student acceptance of AI-generated short videos on learning outcomes compared to paper-based materials. Student acceptance was assessed based on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (A), intentions (I), and concentration (C). The results indicate that both AI-generated short videos and paper-based materials can significantly enhance learning outcomes. AI-generated short videos are more likely to be accepted by students with lower pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at higher levels. On the other hand, paper-based materials are more likely to be accepted by students with higher pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at lower levels. These findings offer empirical evidence supporting the use of AI-generated short videos in FLL and provide suggestions for selecting appropriate learning materials in different FLL contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWho should compensate you if you get hit by a car in âautopilotâ mode: the safety driver or the car manufacturer? What about if you find out you were unfairly discriminated against by an AI decision-making tool that was being supervised by an HR professional? Should the developer compensate you, the company that procured the software, or the (employer of the) HR professional that was âsupervisingâ the system's output?\nThese questions do not have easy answers. In the European Union and elsewhere around the world, AI governance is turning towards risk regulation. Risk regulation alone is, however, rarely optimal. The situations above all involve the liability for harms that are caused by or with an AI system. While risk regulations like the AI Act regulate some aspects of these human and machine interactions, they do not offer those impacted by AI systems any rights and little avenues to seek redress. From a corrective justice perspective risk regulation must also be complemented by liability law because when harms do occur, harmed individuals should be compensated. From a risk-prevention perspective, risk regulation may still fall short of creating optimal incentives for all parties to take precautions.\nBecause risk regulation is not enough, scholars and regulators around the world have highlighted that AI regulations should be complemented by liability rules to address AI harms when they occur. Using a law and economics framework this Article examines how the recently proposed AI liability regime in the EU â a revision of the Product Liability Directive, and an AI Liability effectively complement the AI Act and how they address the particularities of AI-human interactions.",

Nonetheless, this advancement brings forth several ethical dilemmas. The existing research on these ethical concerns within the educational framework is notably scarce, particularly when viewed from a user's standpoint. This research systematically reviewed 17 empirical articles from January 2018 to June 2023, sourced from peer-reviewed journals and conferences, to outlined existing ethical framework in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), identify related concerns from user's perspectives, and construct Ethics Guideline for AIED. The finding revealed that certain ethical aspects, including the ethics of learning analytics and the ethics of algorithms in AIED, are often neglected in the existing ethical frameworks, principles, and standards for AIED. Based on the blank between existing ethical frameworks and ethic concerns from user's perspectives, the research proposes more inclusive and thoughtfully Ethics Guideline for AIED. The study also provides actionable recommendations for multiple stakeholders, emphasizing the need for guidelines that address user-centered concerns. In addition, How this Ethics Guideline for AIED could be developed is discussed, along with outlining potential avenues for future research.",

A decision-aid agent helps a user make decisions, whereas a delegated agent makes decisions on behalf of the consumer. The study determines the factors affecting the adoption intention of AI digital agents as decision aids and delegated agents. The domain of study is banking, financial services, and Insurance sector (BFSI). Due to the unique characteristics of AI digital agents, trust has been identified as an important construct in the extant literature. The study decomposed trust into social, cognitive, and affective trust. We incorporated PLS-SEM and fsQCA to examine the factors drawn from the literature. The findings from PLS-SEM suggest that perceived AI quality affects cognitive trust, perceived usefulness affects affective trust, and social trust affects cognitive and affective trust. The intention to adopt AI as a decision-aid is influenced by affective and cognitive trust. The intention to adopt AI as delegated agents is influenced by social, cognitive, and affective trust. FsQCA findings indicate that combining AI quality, perceived usefulness, and trust (social, cognitive, and affective) best explains the intention to adopt AI as a decision aid and delegated agents.",

This paper presents a conceptual model for using AI-enabled anomaly detection systems to identify anomalies and security threats in smart city IoT networks. The foundation is supported by the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In this framework, the importance of user engagement in ensuring effective AI-driven cybersecurity solutions is underlined with an emphasis on technological readiness and human interaction with AI. By fostering a security-conscious culture through continuous education and skills development, this research provides actionable insights for enhancing the resilience of smart cities against evolving cyber threats. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for future empirical studies and offers practical guidance for policymakers and urban planners dedicated to safeguarding the digital infrastructures of potentially tomorrow's cities â the smart cities.",

Fourteen questions on epilepsy and physical exercise were designed to compare the platforms. Lexical similarity, response patterns, and thematic content were analyzed. Readability was measured using the Flesch Reading Ease and FleschâKincaid Grade Level scores. Seven experts rated the quality of responses on a Likert scale from âvery poorâ to âvery good.â\nResults\nThe responses showed lexical similarity, with approaches to physical exercise ranging from conservative to holistic. Microsoft Copilot scored the highest on the Flesch Reading Ease scale (48.42 Â± 13.71), while ChatGPT-3.5 scored the lowest (23.84 Â± 8.19). All responses were generally rated as difficult to read. Quality ratings ranged from âGoodâ to âAcceptable,â with ChatGPT 4 being the preferred platform, chosen by 48.98 % of reviewers.\nConclusion\nThe findings highlight the potential of AI chatbots as useful sources of information on epilepsy and physical exercise. However, simplifying language and tailoring content to userâs needs is essential to enhance their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEmotional artificial intelligence (AI), i.e., affective computing technologies, is rapidly reshaping the education of young minds worldwide. In Japan, government and commercial stakeholders are promulgating emotional AI not only as a neoliberal, cost-saving benefit but also as a heuristic that can improve the learning experience at home and in the classroom. Nevertheless, critics warn of a myriad of risks and harms posed by the technology such as privacy violation, unresolved deeper cultural and systemic issues, machinic parentalism as well as the danger of imposing attitudinal conformity. This study brings together the Technological Acceptance Model and Moral Foundation Theory to examine the cultural construal of risks and rewards regarding the application of emotional AI technologies. It explores Japanese citizensâ perceptions of emotional AI in education and children's toys via analysis of a final sample of 2000 Japanese respondents with five age groups (20sâ60s) and two sexes equally represented. The linear regression models for determinants of attitude toward emotional AI in education and in toys account for 44 % and 38 % variation in the data, respectively. The analyses reveal a significant negative correlation between attitudes toward emotional AI in both schools and toys and concerns about privacy violations or the dystopian nature of constantly monitoring of children and studentsâ emotions with AI (Education: Î²DystopianConcern = â .094***; Toys: Î²PrivacyConcern = â .199***). However, worries about autonomy and bias show mixed results, which hints at certain cultural nuances of values in a Japanese context and how new the technologies are. Concurring with the empirical literature on the Moral Foundation Theory, the chi-square (Î§2) test shows Japanese female respondents express more fear regarding the potential harms of emotional AI technologies for the youth's privacy, autonomy, data misuse, and fairness (p < 0.001). The policy implications of these results and insights on the impacts of emotional AI for the future of human-machine interaction are also provided.",

This study compares the open artificial intelligence generative pretrained transformer-4 (GPT-4) model, based on the (GPT), and Google's artificial intelligence (AI), which is based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework in terms of the defined capabilities and the built-in architecture. Both LLMs are prominent in AI applications. First, eight different capabilities were identified to evaluate these models, i.e. translation accuracy, text generation, factuality, creativity, intellect, deception avoidance, sentiment classification, and sarcasm detection. Next, each capability was assessed using instructions. Additionally, a categorized LLM evaluation system has been developed by means of using ten research questions per category based on this paper's main contributions from a prompt engineering perspective. It should be highlighted that GPT-4 and Google AI successfully answered 85 % and 68,7 % of the study prompts, respectively. It has been noted that GPT-4 better understands prompts than Google AI, even with verbal flaws, and tolerates grammatical errors. Moreover, the GPT-4 based approach was more precise, accurate, and succinct than Google AI, which was sometimes verbose and less realistic. While GPT-4 beats Google AI in terms of translation accuracy, text generation, factuality, intellectuality, creativity, and deception avoidance, Google AI outperforms the former when considering sarcasm detection. Both sentiment classification models did work properly. More importantly, a human panel of judges was used to assess and evaluate the model comparisons. Statistical analysis of the judges' ratings revealed more robust results based on examining the specific uses, limitations, and expectations of both GPT-4 and Google AI-based approaches. Finally, the two approaches' transformers, parameter sizes, and attention mechanisms have been examined.",

The research highlights the benefits of introducing a virtual AI-Coach in a hospital setting. The practical application setting revolves around a medical team responsible for managing neonates with respiratory distress. In this setting an AI-Coach act as an additional team member, to ensure correct execution of medical procedure. Through simulation experiments, the adaptive network models demonstrate that the AI-Coach not only aids in maintaining correct medical procedure execution but also facilitates organizational learning, leading to significant improvements in procedure adherence and error reduction during neonatal care.",

However, sociological studies have started to show that these technologies are not producing straightforward objective knowledge, but instead often become associated with new uncertainties arising in unanticipated places and situations. This study contributes to the body of work by presenting a qualitative study of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to predict the risk of mortality in patients discharged to home from the emergency department (ED). Through in-depth interviews with physicians working at the ED of a Swedish hospital, we demonstrate that while the AI algorithm can reduce targeted uncertainty, it simultaneously introduces three new forms of uncertainty into clinical practice: epistemic uncertainty, actionable uncertainty and ethical uncertainty. These new uncertainties require deliberate management and control, marking a shift from the physicians' accustomed comfort with uncertainty in mortality prediction. Our study advances the understanding of the recursive nature and temporal dynamics of uncertainty in medical work, showing how new uncertainties emerge from attempts to manage existing ones. It also reveals that physiciansâ attitudes towards, and management of, uncertainty vary depending on its form and underscores the intertwined role of digital technology in this process. By examining AI in emergency care, we provide valuable insights into how this epistemic technology reconfigures clinical uncertainty, offering significant theoretical and practical implications for the integration of AI in healthcare.",

Traditional experimental methods are often slow and expensive, driving the need for advanced AI-based approaches in PK modelling. This study compares cutting-edge machine learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformers, and Stacking Ensembles, against traditional models like Random Forest and XGBoost, using a dataset of over 10,000 bioactive compounds from the ChEMBL database. The Stacking Ensemble model achieved the highest accuracy (R2 of 0.92, MAE of 0.062), outperforming GNNs (R2 of 0.90) and Transformers (R2 of 0.89). These AI models excelled in capturing complex molecular interactions and long-range dependencies, significantly improving PK predictions. The high accuracy achieved (R2 = 0.92) by the Stacking Ensemble method indicates that AI models can streamline the drug discovery process by reducing costly in vivo experiments, enabling faster go/no-go decisions during preclinical evaluations, and ultimately accelerating the development of new therapeutics. This reduction in time and cost could facilitate broader industry adoption of AI-driven PK modelling. Furthermore, Bayesian optimization was employed to fine-tune hyperparameters, further enhancing the performance and robustness of these predictive models.",

Systematic reviews suggest that there are many machine learning algorithms in surgery, however, only a minority of the studies integrate AI applications in clinical workflows. Our objective was to design and evaluate a concept to use different kinds of AI for decision support in oncological liver surgery along the treatment path.\nMethods\nIn an exploratory co-creation between design experts, surgeons, and data scientists, pain points along the treatment path were identified. Potential designs for AI-assisted solutions were developed and iteratively refined. Finally, an evaluation of the design concept was performed with n = 20 surgeons to get feedback on the different functionalities and evaluate the usability with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Participating surgeons had a mean of 14.0 Â± 5.0 years of experience after graduation.\nResults\nThe design concept was named âAliadoâ. Five different scenarios were identified where AI could support surgeons. Mean score of SUS was 68.2 ( Â± 13.6 SD). The highest valued functionalities were âindividualized prediction of survival, short-term mortality and morbidityâ, and âindividualized recommendation of surgical strategyâ.\nConclusion\nAliado is a design prototype that shows how AI could be integrated into the clinical workflow. Even without a fleshed out user interface, the SUS already yielded borderline good results. Expert surgeons rated the functionalities favorably, and most of them expressed their willingness to work with a similar application in the future. Thus, Aliado can serve as a surgical vision of how an ideal AI-based assistance could look like.\nGraphical abstract\nVisual Abstract.

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nOverview of methods for updating AI-based clinical prediction models.\nâ¢\nUpdate reasons were changes over time, center, setting (non-clinicalâclinical), etc.\nâ¢\nMost articles focused on neural networks and medical imaging.\nâ¢\nMost common NN updating method re-uses only first layers of original network.\nâ¢\nUpdating methods for models other than neural networks seem underexplored.\nAbstract\nObjective\nTo give an overview of methods for updating AI-based clinical prediction models based on new data.\nStudy Design and Setting\nWe comprehensively searched Scopus and EMBASE up to August 2022 for articles that addressed developments, descriptions, or evaluations of prediction model updating methods. We specifically focused on articles in the medical domain involving AI-based prediction models that were updated based on new data, excluding regression-based updating methods as these have been extensively discussed elsewhere. We categorized and described the identified methods used to update the AI-based prediction model as well as the use cases in which they were used.\nResults\nWe included 78 articles. The majority of the included articles discussed updating for neural network methods (93.6%) with medical images as input data (65.4%). In many articles (51.3%) existing, pre-trained models for broad tasks were updated to perform specialized clinical tasks. Other common reasons for model updating were to address changes in the data over time and cross-center differences; however, more unique use cases were also identified, such as updating a model from a broad population to a specific individual.\nWe categorized the identified model updating methods into four categories: neural network-specific methods (described in 92.3% of the articles), ensemble-specific methods (2.5%), model-agnostic methods (9.0%), and other (1.3%). Variations of neural network-specific methods are further categorized based on: (1) the part of the original neural network that is kept, (2) whether and how the original neural network is extended with new parameters, and (3) to what extent the original neural network parameters are adjusted to the new data. The most frequently occurring method (n=30) involved selecting the first layer(s) of an existing neural network, appending new, randomly initialized layers, and then optimizing the entire neural network.\nConclusion\nWe identified many ways to adjust or update AI-based prediction models based on new data, within a large variety of use cases. Updating methods for AI-based prediction models other than neural networks (e.g., random forest) appear to be underexplored in clinical prediction research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its widespread adoption have given rise to a critical need for understanding the underlying factors that shape users' behavioral intentions. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to explain user perceived behavioral intentions and use behavior of AI technologies for academic purposes in a developing country. This study has adopted the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and extended it with two dimensions: trust and privacy. Data have been collected from 310 AI users including teachers, researchers, and students. This study finds that users' behavioral intention is positively and significantly associated with trust, social influence, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. Privacy, on the other hand, has a negative yet significant relationship with behavioral intention unveiling that concerns over privacy can deter users from intending to use AI technologies which is a valuable insight for developers and educators. In determining use behavior, facilitating condition, behavioral intention, and privacy have significant positive impact. This study hasn't found any significant relationship between trust and use behavior elucidating that service providers should have unwavering focus on security measures, credible endorsements, and transparency to build user confidence. In an era dominated by the fourth industrial revolution, this research underscores the pivotal roles of trust and privacy in technology adoption. In addition, this study sheds light on users' perspective to effectively align AI-based technologies with the education system of developing countries. The practical implications encompass insights for service providers, educational institutions, and policymakers, facilitating the smooth adoption of AI technologies in developing countries while emphasizing the importance of trust, privacy, and ongoing refinement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in dental diagnostics is evolving, offering innovative approaches for conducting cephalometric analysis with less manual input and overcoming the limitations of traditional imaging methods. To enhance the diagnostic processes in dentistry, an open-source software that utilises AI to improve the extraction of cephalometric values from limited field of view (FOV) images was created.\nMaterial and Methods\nReduced FOV images lack several vital cephalometric landmarks, prompting the creation of predictive models to estimate missing values. The GridSearchCV algorithm and other algorithms were used to construct predictive models using software and to select the best models. The software was validated by comparing the predicted values with the actual measurements and calculating the mean squared error using Excel. Further validation involved a randomly selected cohort of 25 untreated orthodontic cases.\nResults\nEvaluation of the software showed that it was effective in accurately predicting key cephalometric measurements, suggesting that it could be a reliable tool for clinical use. However, some variations were noted in its predictive accuracy across different measurements, indicating areas that could benefit from further development. The software could align closely with the actual cephalometric measurements through detailed statistical analysis.\nConclusions\nThe integration of AI into cephalometric analysis with the software could represent progress, potentially leading to more efficient dental diagnostics and a reduction in the need for additional X-rays. This study aimed to advance the integration and refinement of AI in healthcare, focusing on minimising bias and understanding its impact on clinical decisions. In future studies, the application of AI in dental practice should be expanded to address these challenges.\nClinical Significance Statement\nThis software integrates AI into clinical practice to enhance the diagnostic and therapeutic phases for patient benefit. It enables precise and comprehensive cephalometric analyses using data previously considered insufficient, thereby reducing the need for X-rays and improving patient care.",

This paper explores the performance of traditional and digital assets as tools for hedging, diversification, and safe-haven strategies during the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse. Utilizing daily data from April 30, 2021, to September 15, 2023, and employing the Asymmetric Dynamic Conditional Correlation (ADCC) model, which combines four Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family models and two residual distributions, we conduct a comprehensive analysis. The results indicate that Bitcoin's role as a safe haven is limited during the geopolitical crisis, impacting specific stocks, while gold's effectiveness varies. Digix Gold (DGX) demonstrates robust safe-haven properties, and Paxos Gold (PAXG) proves notably effective for certain stocks. Before the SVB crisis, gold primarily acts as a diversifier but later emerges as a significant safe haven during the banking crisis. These findings provide valuable insights to portfolio managers, emphasizing the importance of adaptive asset allocation in addressing financial uncertainties.",

AI capabilities to address prompts are growing beyond human capability but we expect AI to perform well also as a prompt engineer. Additionally, AI can serve as a guardian for ethical, security, and other predefined issues related to generated content. We postulate that enforcing dialogues among AI-as-prompt-engineer, AI-as-prompt-responder, and AI-as-Compliance-Guardian can lead to high-quality and responsible solutions. This paper introduces a novel AI collaboration paradigm emphasizing responsible autonomy, with implications for addressing real-world challenges. The paradigm of responsible AI-AI conversation establishes structured interaction patterns, guaranteeing decision-making autonomy. Key implications include enhanced understanding of AI dialogue flow, compliance with rules and regulations, and decision-making scenarios exemplifying responsible autonomy. Real-world applications envision AI systems autonomously addressing complex challenges. We have made preliminary testing of such a paradigm involving instances of ChatGPT autonomously playing various roles in a set of experimental AI-AI conversations and observed evident added value of such a framework.",

Through an exhaustive literature analysis and expert discussions, the research identifies and categorizes significant obstacles to AI deployment in the FSC. These hurdles include the imperative for a skilled labor force, financial limits, regulatory complexity and technological limitations. The unique DEMATEL-NK approach highlights the interconnected nature of these barriers, pinpointing the most critical impediments. The study's implications extend to the broader domains of AI adoption in agriculture and the food industry, offering a nuanced perspective for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers. The findings underscore the imperative of overcoming these barriers for the successful implementation of AI technologies in the FSC, promising advancements in efficiency, quality, and sustainability. The innovative methodology not only sheds light on the interconnectedness of these barriers but also provides a systematic approach for prioritizing and implementing solutions. This research offers a fresh viewpoint on barrier relationships, guiding decision-makers in crafting effective strategies and interventions to propel AI integration in the FSC forward.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (252KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a promising tool to evaluate respiratory conditions in neonates. This evaluation is mainly based on the interpretation of visual patterns (horizontal artifacts, vertical artifacts, and consolidations). Automated interpretation of these patterns can assist clinicians in their evaluations. However, developing AI-based solutions for this purpose is challenging, primarily due to the lack of annotated data and inherent subjectivity in expert interpretations. This study aims to propose an automated solution for the reliable interpretation of patterns in LUS videos of newborns. We employed two distinct strategies. The first strategy is a frame-to-video-level approach that computes frame-level predictions from deep learning (DL) models trained from scratch (F2V-TS) along with fine-tuning pre-trained models (F2V-FT) followed by aggregation of those predictions for video-level evaluation. The second strategy is a direct video classification approach (DV) for evaluating LUS data. To evaluate our methods, we used LUS data from 34 neonatal patients comprising of 70 exams with annotations provided by three expert human operators (3HOs). Results show that within the frame-to-video-level approach, F2V-FT achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 77% showing moderate agreement with the 3HOs. while the direct video classification approach resulted in an accuracy of 72%, showing substantial agreement with the 3HOs, our proposed study lays down the foundation for reliable AI-based solutions for newborn LUS data evaluation.",

We argue that, when generative AI is seen through a traditional computing lens, its development focuses on optimizing for traditional computing traits that remain in principle unattainable. This risks backgrounding what is most novel and defining about it. As probabilistic technologies, generative AIs do not store, in any traditional sense, any data or content. Rather, essential features of training data become encoded in deep neural networks as patterns, that become practically available as styles. We discuss what happens when the distinction between objects and their appearance dissolves and all aspects of images or text become understood as styles, accessible for exploration and creative combination and generation. For example, defining visual qualities of entities like âchairâ or âcatâ become available as âchair-nessâ or âcat-nessâ for creative image generation. We argue that, when understood as style engines, unique generative AI capabilities become conceptualized as complementing traditional computing ones. This will aid both computing practitioners and information systems researchers in reconciling and integrating generative AI into the traditional IS landscape. Our conceptualization leads us to propose four archetypes of generative AI application and use, and to highlight future avenues for information systems research made visible by this conceptualization, as well as implications for practice and policymaking.",

The sensitivities of unassisted radiologists (original CT radiology reports), AI reports alone and both combined were compared. Ground truth was established by a consensus reading of two radiologists, who analyzed whether the nodules mentioned in the pathology report were retrospectively visible on CT. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify nodule characteristics associated with detectability.\nResults\nA total of 167 patients (men: 62.9 %; median age, 59 years [47â68]) with 475 resected nodules were included. AI detected an average of 4 nodules (0â17) per CT, of which 97 % were true nodules. The combination of radiologist plus AI (92.4 %) had significantly higher sensitivity than unassisted radiologists (80.4 %) (p < 0.001). In 27/57 (47.4 %) patients who had multiple preoperative CT scans, AI detected lung nodules earlier than the radiologist. Vascular contact was associated with non-detection by radiologists (OR:0.32[0.19, 0.54], p < 0.001), whilst the presence of cavitation (OR:0.26[0.13, 0.54], p < 0.001) or pleural contact (OR:0.10[0.04, 0.22], p < 0.001) was associated with non-detection by AI.\nConclusion\nAI significantly increases the sensitivity of preoperative detection of lung metastases and enables earlier detection, with a significant potential benefit for patient management.",

We analyze the far-reaching implications of a two-pronged knowledge on SoA and its impact on humanâAI interactions. We argue that although there are interesting research efforts for an AI to inherently possess SoA, they are still sparse, constrained in scope and present unclear immediate benefit to the design of AI-enabled systems. We also argue that the knowledge on how human SoA is affected by an AI that is perceived to possess a sense of control presents more immediate benefit to AI, in particular, to eliciting positive human attitudes toward AI. Third, and lastly, we argue that research efforts for an AI to adapt to the dynamic changes of human SoA are practically non-existent primarily due to the difficulty of modeling, inferring and adaptively responding to human SoA in complex natural settings. We proceed by first delving deep into the influential and recent theoretical underpinnings of SoA, and discuss its conceptual reach in different disciplines and how it is applied in real-world research. We organize a substantial part of our paper to put forward and elucidate our three argumentative points while supported by evidence in the literature.",

Sample size of 71 responded in an intervention using game-based learning (GBL) approach. The purpose of designing the GBL was to enhance computational thinking and mathematical skills. The research employed multigroup partial least squares structural equation modelling (MGA-PLS-SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) through multilayer perceptron (MLP) as data analysis technique. The findings showed significant positive influence on class engagement, attitudes toward mathematics, as well as student performance. The analysis also revealed gender-related variations, which affirmed the model's consistency across diverse groups. The study validated the hypothesis and consequently advocated for the transformative potential of gamification, in preparation of 21st-century learners for AI-driven digital landscape. The implications are to ensure the integration of gamified elements into educational strategies, benefiting educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers resonating strongly for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nChatGPT and Bard (now known as Gemini) are becoming indispensable resources for researchers, academicians and diverse stakeholders within the academic landscape. At the same time, traditional digital tools such as scholarly databases continue to be widely used. Web of Science and Scopus are the most extensive academic databases and are generally regarded as consistently reliable scholarly research resources. With the increasing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing, this study focuses on understanding the reliability of the new AI models compared to Scopus and Web of Science. The study includes a bibliometric analysis of green, sustainable and ecological buying behaviour, covering the period from 1 January 2011 to 21 May 2023. These results are used to compare the results from the AI and the traditional scholarly databases on several parameters. Overall, the findings suggest that AI models like ChatGPT and Bard are not yet reliable for academic writing tasks. It appears to be too early to depend on AI for such tasks.",

By demonstrating that AI can closely match human accuracy in filtering relevant studies, this research paves the way for more efficient, rigorous syntheses of scientific knowledge. Looking ahead, this work invites transdisciplinary collaboration, combining expertise in AI, data science, and various research fields to further refine these tools. The potential societal impact is substantial; policymakers, practitioners, and researchers can leverage these advancements to more rapidly inform actions on urgent issues related to environmental management.\nSummary\nSystematic approaches to evidence synthesis can improve the rigor, transparency, and replicability of a literature review. However, these systematic approaches are resource intensive. We evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to undertake two stages of evidence syntheses (searching peer-reviewed literature and screening for relevance) and develop a collaborative framework to leverage both human and AI intelligence. Using a scoping review of community-based fisheries management as a case study, we find that with substantial prompting, the AI can provide critical insight into the construction and content of a search string. Thereafter, we evaluate five strategies for synthesizing AI output to screen articles based on predefined inclusion criteria. We find that low omission rates (<1%) of relevant literature by the AI are achievable, which is comparable to human screeners. These findings suggest that generalized AI tools can assist reviewers to accelerate the implementation and improve the reliability of literature reviews, thus supporting evidence-informed decision-making.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (169KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, AI can also commit errors or suffer from algorithmic bias. Hence, blind trust in technologies carries risks, as users may follow detrimental advice resulting in undesired consequences. Building upon research on algorithm appreciation and trust in AI, the current study investigates whether users who receive AI advice in an uncertain situation overrely on this advice â to their own detriment and that of other parties. In a domain-independent, incentivized, and interactive behavioral experiment, we find that the mere knowledge of advice being generated by an AI causes people to overrely on it, that is, to follow AI advice even when it contradicts available contextual information as well as their own assessment. Frequently, this overreliance leads not only to inefficient outcomes for the advisee, but also to undesired effects regarding third parties. The results call into question how AI is being used in assisted decision making, emphasizing the importance of AI literacy and effective trust calibration for productive deployment of such systems.",

However, it is prone to diseases like cancer. Manual assessments introduce accuracy variations, consistency issues, and delays. Resources like the GastroVision dataset were introduced to advance AI in this field. Yet, it faces class imbalance issues, and baseline evaluation lacks novel methodologies, impacting accuracy. We propose a novel deep-learning model to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach involves averaging weights of multiple models fine-tuned with diverse hyper-parameters. In contrast to classical ensembles, our approach uses DenseNet-121 as a baseline and enables the averaging of numerous models without incurring extra inference or memory costs. Data augmentation techniques are incorporated to address class imbalance. We achieve promising results on standard performance metrics, substantially improving over baseline, notably 2.4% points in Macro Precision. Additionally, we integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance reliability and interpretability, shedding light on the modelâs decision-making processes. Our study contributes to robust methodologies for imbalanced datasets, promoting model transparency and trust in predictive outcomes for clinical decision support systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs artificial intelligence proliferates across various sectors, it is crucial to explore the psychological impacts of over-reliance on these systems. This study examines how different formats of chatbot assistance (instruction-only, answer-only, and combined instruction and answer) influence user performance and reliance over time. In two experiments, participants completed reasoning tests with the aid of a chatbot, \"Cogbot,\" offering varying levels of explanatory detail and direct answers. In Experiment 1, participants receiving direct answers showed higher reliance on the chatbot compared to those receiving instructions, aligning with the practical hypothesis that prioritizes efficiency over explainability. Experiment 2 introduced transfer problems with incorrect AI guidance, revealing that initial reliance on direct answers impaired performance on subsequent tasks when the AI erred, supporting concerns about automation complacency. Findings indicate that while efficiency-focused AI solutions enhance immediate performance, they risk over-assimilation and reduced vigilance, leading to significant performance drops when AI accuracy falters. Conversely, explanatory guidance did not significantly improve outcomes absent of direct answers. These results highlight the complex dynamics between AI efficiency and accountability, suggesting that responsible AI adoption requires balancing streamlined functionality with safeguards against over-reliance.",

The evaluation, conducted by 18 experienced oral and maxillofacial surgeons, assessed consents for accuracy, completeness, readability, and overall quality.\nChatGPT-4 consistently outperformed both Bard and human-written consents. ChatGPT-4 consents had a median accuracy score of 4 [IQR 4-4], compared to Bard's 3 [IQR 3â4] and human's 4 [IQR 3â4]. Completeness scores were higher for ChatGPT-4 (4 [IQR 4â5]) than Bard (3 [IQR 3â4]) and human (4 [IQR 3â4]). Readability was also superior for ChatGPT-4, with a median score of 4 [IQR 4â5] compared to Bard and human consents, both at 4 [IQR 4-4] and 4 [IQR 3â4], respectively. The Gunning Fog Index for ChatGPT-4 was 17.2 [IQR 16.5â18.2], better than Bard's 23.1 [IQR 20.5â24.7] and the human consents' 20 [IQR 19.2â20.9].\nOverall, ChatGPT-4's consents received the highest quality ratings, underscoring AI's potential in enhancing patient communication and the informed consent process. The study suggests AI can reduce misinformation risks and improve patient understanding, but continuous evaluation, oversight, and patient feedback integration are crucial to ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness of AI-generated content in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nDespite the rapid increase of AI-enabled applications deployed in clinical practice, many challenges exist around AI implementation, including the clarity of governance frameworks, usability of validation of AI models, and customisation of training for radiographers. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, with existing theoretical and/or practical knowledge of AI, on issues of relevance to the field, such as AI implementation, including knowledge of AI governance and procurement, perceptions about enablers and challenges and future priorities for AI adoption.\nMethods\nAn online survey was designed and distributed to UK-based qualified radiographers who work in medical imaging and/or radiotherapy and have some previous theoretical and/or practical knowledge of working with AI. Participants were recruited through the researchersâ professional networks on social media with support from the AI advisory group of the Society and College of Radiographers. Survey questions related to AI training/education, knowledge of AI governance frameworks, data privacy procedures, AI implementation considerations, and priorities for AI adoption. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyse the data, and chi-square tests were used to explore significant relationships between variables.\nResults\nIn total, 88 valid responses were received. Most radiographers (56.6 %) had not received any AI-related training. Also, although approximately 63 % of them used an evaluation framework to assess AI modelsâ performance before implementation, many (36.9 %) were still unsure about suitable evaluation methods. Radiographers requested clearer guidance on AI governance, ample time to implement AI in their practice safely, adequate funding, effective leadership, and targeted support from AI champions. AI training, robust governance frameworks, and patient and public involvement were seen as priorities for the successful implementation of AI by radiographers.\nConclusion\nAI implementation is progressing within radiography, but without customised training, clearer governance, key stakeholder engagement and suitable new roles created, it will be hard to harness its benefits and minimise related risks.\nImplications for practice\nThe results of this study highlight some of the priorities and challenges for radiographers in relation to AI adoption, namely the need for developing robust AI governance frameworks and providing optimal AI training.",

However, adoption rates remain low, often due to insufficient user and stakeholder involvement during the design phases.\nObjective\nThis study explores the human-centered design potentials of SHIVA, a DTx integrating virtual reality and AI with the SelfHelp+ intervention, aiming to understand stakeholder views and expectations that could influence its adoption.\nMethods\nUsing the SHIVA example, we detail design opportunities involving AI techniques for stress prevention across modeling, personalization, monitoring, and simulation dimensions. Workshops with 12 stakeholdersâincluding target users, digital health designers, and mental health expertsâaddressed four key adoption aspects through peer interviews: AI data processing, wearable device roles, deployment scenarios, and the model's transparency, explainability, and accuracy.\nResults\nStakeholders perceived AI-based data processing as beneficial for personalized treatment in a secure, privacy-preserving environment. While wearables were deemed essential, concerns about compulsory use and VR headset costs were noted. Initial human facilitation was favored to enhance engagement and prevent dropouts. Transparency, explainability, and accuracy were highlighted as crucial for the stress detection model.\nConclusion\nStakeholders recognized AI-driven opportunities as crucial for SHIVA's adoption, facilitating personalized solutions tailored to user needs. Nonetheless, challenges persist in developing a transparent, explainable, and accurate stress detection model to ensure user engagement, adherence, and trust.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSome firms have successfully harnessed artificial intelligence (AI) to create unparalleled wealth, while most around them have failed to do so. This managerial challenge has led to recent calls for research to answer the question of how firms can use AI to create and appropriate economic value. This paper answers that question. The paper reviews the existing research and discusses its merits. This review highlights the need for subsequent conceptual reconfigurations of business model theory, the theory of data network effects, and the theory of situated AI for competitive advantage. The integration of these three theories leads to a novel theory: AI-enabled business models for competitive advantage. This paper contributes to the broad literature on technology management, and more specifically to literature on technology-enabled business models and the use of AI. Several important managerial implications are outlined to help firms ensure successful AI use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSocial isolation and loneliness pose significant challenges to individual well-being and public health. Conversational AI agents have emerged as a promising tool for addressing social isolation by providing personalized support and companionship to isolated individuals. This study aims to investigate the role of conversational AI agents in providing support and social care for isolated individuals. It seeks to understand the effectiveness of these agents in mitigating loneliness, enhancing social connectedness, and improving overall well-being. While previous research has explored the use of technology for combating social isolation, this study focuses specifically on conversational AI agents and their unique capabilities in delivering personalized and empathetic support to isolated individuals. The research framework encompasses a mixed methods approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the experiences and perceptions of isolated individuals interacting with conversational AI agents. Preliminary findings suggest that conversational AI agents hold promise in providing meaningful support and companionship to isolated individuals. Qualitative analysis reveals themes related to the perceived usefulness, ease of use, and emotional connection facilitated by these agents. Quantitative analysis indicates correlations between factors such as age, gender, and the effectiveness of conversational AI agents in addressing social isolation. This study underscores the potential of conversational AI agents in alleviating social isolation and loneliness among isolated individuals. These agents assist in improving general well-being and social connectivity by offering individualized assistance and companionship. The findings guide academics, practitioners, and policymakers who want to use technology to combat social isolation and enhance mental health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study introduces a new adoption model for assessing the quality of experience (QoE) of radiologists using AI-based medical imaging technology. While AI has increasingly been used by radiologists for screening, diagnosis, and classification of medical images, previous investigations have primarily focused on metrics such as effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. This research expands the evaluation criteria to include user experience and user interface (UX/UI) factors, integrating them within the broader QoE. QoE is conceptualized as a multifaceted construct influenced by both human and system factors, which affect cognitive perception, including hedonic and pragmatic aspects. Data were collected from 159 hospital radiologists with prior experience in using AI technology in medical imaging systems through a structured questionnaire. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling principles. The findings suggest that contextual content, human factors, and system characteristics significantly influence cognitive perception, which in turn affects the adoption and utilization of AI in medical imaging. This adoption model captures the radiologists' integration of AI throughout various stages of radiological procedures, including scheduling, scanning, acquisition, interpretation, reporting, and communication. The study also highlights the importance of data collection, storage, and sharing practices in compliance with privacy policies.",

The wide applicability of this semiotic reconstruction process is suggested by a reputed literary scholarâs deconstructive claim that new narratives can often be shown to be a tissue of previous narratives. Along, respectively, three semiotic axes â syntagmatic, paradigmatic, and meronymic â existing stories can yield new stories by the combination, imitation, or expansion of an iconic scene; lastly, a new story may emerge through reversal via an antithetic consideration, i.e., through the adoption of opposite values. Targeting casual users, we present a fully operational prototype with a simple and user-friendly interface that incorporates an AI agent, namely ChatGPT. The prototype, in a coauthor capacity, generates context-compatible sequences of events in storyboard format using backward-chaining abductive reasoning (employing Stable Diffusion to draw scene illustrations), conforming as much as possible to the userâs authorial instructions. The extensive repertoire of book and movie summaries available to the AI agent obviates the need to manually supply laborious and error-prone context specifications. A user study was conducted to evaluate user experience and satisfaction with the generated narratives. The preliminary findings suggest that our approach has the potential to enhance story quality while offering a positive user experience.",

While the abundance of data allows for sophisticated feature engineering techniques that can enhance accuracy, it is crucial to highlight both the computational costs and the efficiency with which these models operate. This paper compares the processing time and accuracy of individual and hybrid Machine Learning (ML) models in predicting customer loyalty within financial contexts. Frameworks that incorporate feature engineering and green AI principles are used separately in both individual and hybrid approaches. The individual models are the commonly used regressor-based algorithms applied to business problems. The hybrid models first use k-Means to cluster customers, followed by the application of individual regressor-based models (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and LightGBM). The present results show that using fewer features results in only a marginally lower accuracy compared to models with more features (a difference of\nin MAE when comparing the use of 18 versus 85 features). Additionally, this article clearly demonstrate the trade-off between higher accuracy and longer computational time in hybrid ML models versus lower accuracy and shorter computational time in individual models when predicting customer loyalty. Hybrid models exhibit a lower MSE (\n) compared to individual models (\n). These findings provide managers with insights on selecting the most appropriate model based on their organizationâs specific needs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the application of sustainable Nature-based Solution (NbS) for coastal engineering, a significant challenge lies in determining the effectiveness of these NbS approaches in mitigating coastal erosion. The efficacy of NbS is influenced by various factors, including the specific location, layout, and the scale of implementation. This study integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with hydro-morphodynamic numerical simulations to develop an AI-based emulator focused on predicting Bed Level Changes (BLC) as indicators of erosion and deposition dynamics. Specifically, we explore the influence of seagrass meadows, varying in starting depth (hs) and depth range (hr), on coastal erosion mitigation during storm events.\nThe framework leverages a hybrid approach combining the SCHISM-WWM hydrodynamic model with XBeach for simulating 180 depth range and starting depth combination (hr-hs) scenarios along the Norderney coast in the German Bight. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed with dual inputsâroller energy and Eulerian velocityâto predict BLC efficiently. The CNN demonstrates high accuracy in replicating spatial erosion patterns and quantifying erosion volumes, achieving an RMSE of 3.47 cm and an RÂ² of 0.94 during validation.\nThis innovative integration of AI and NbS not only reduces computational costs associated with traditional numerical modelling but also enhances the feasibility of What-if Scenarios applications for coastal erosion management. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven approaches to optimize seagrass transplantation layouts and inform sustainable coastal protection strategies effectively. Future advancements aim to further streamline model integration and scalability, thereby advancing NbS applications in enhancing coastal resilience against environmental stressors.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (274KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

We describe here a pilot study employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the assessment of TILs and other cell populations, intending to reduce the inter- or intra-observer variability that commonly characterizes this evaluation.\nDesign\nWe developed a machine learning-based classifier to detect tumor, immune, and stromal cells on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, using the open-source framework QuPath. We evaluated the quantity of the aforementioned three cell populations among 37 LC whole slide images regions of interest, comparing the assessments made by five pathologists, both before and after using graphical predictions made by AI, for a total of 1110 quantitative measurements.\nResults\nOur findings indicate noteworthy variations in score distribution among pathologists and between individual pathologists and AI. The AI-guided pathologist's evaluations resulted in reduction of significant discrepancies across pathologists: three comparisons showed a loss of significance (pâ¯>â¯0.05), whereas other four showed a reduction in significance (pâ¯>â¯0.01).\nConclusions\nWe show that employing a machine learning approach in cell population quantification reduces inter- and intra-observer variability, improving reproducibility and facilitating its use in further validation studies.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nWe surveyed university educators and students across three continents about ChatGPT.\nâ¢\nThough their use of ChatGPT was limited, they perceived it to impact assessments.\nâ¢\nAcademic integrity and authenticity are negatively impacted by generative AI.\nâ¢\nEducators prefer adapted assessments that incorporate generative AI more than students.\nAbstract\nThe growing use of generative AI tools built on large language models (LLMs) calls the sustainability of traditional assessment practices into question. Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate eloquent essays on any topic and in any language, write code in various programming languages, and ace most standardized tests, all within seconds. We conducted an international survey of educators and students in higher education to understand and compare their perspectives on the impact of generative AI across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Across three universities, 680 students and 87 educators, who moderately use generative AI, consider essay and coding assessments to be most impacted. Educators strongly prefer assessments that are adapted to assume the use of AI and encourage critical thinking, while students' reactions are mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, alongside higher-order thinking and authentic applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to investigate the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption on public service delivery efficiency in India. It addresses a significant gap in existing literature by investigating the impact of AI adoption on public service delivery efficiency in India, a context that has not been extensively explored. Through a comparative analysis approach, the study assesses the effectiveness of AI applications in enhancing public service delivery. The quantitative research design employed in the study draws on previous literature on AI integration in governance and focuses on Chief Information Officers (CIOs) as primary respondents. The findings reveal significant improvements in citizen-centric services and municipal processes due to AI adoption. However, the impact on human-centric aspects is found to be moderate. The study also underscores the importance of infrastructure readiness for successful AI implementation. Notably, only 25â¯% of organizations were found to be possessing advanced technological infrastructure. This research is original in its focus on Chief Information Officers (CIOs) as primary respondents and its comparative analysis approach to assess the effectiveness of AI applications in enhancing public service delivery. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. Emphasizing the need for effective policies and infrastructure development, it highlights the potential of AI to eliminate corruption risks and enhance overall efficiency and transparency in public service delivery mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT by students has the potential to disrupt the higher education sector, with concerns being raised by academics about potential threats to academic integrity. This paper contributes to the pressing discussion about responses to AI tools by examining students' perceptions and the use of generative AI to assist them with assessments. Based on a survey among 337 Australian university students, this study found that more than a third of students have used a chatbot for assistance with an assessment, and do not necessarily perceive this as a breach of academic integrity. The study further investigated to what extent different psychosocial factors such as learning motivations, distress or resilience are associated with studentsâ use of AI chatbots in order to ascertain environmental conditions or risk factors driving their use. Findings suggest that the higher education sector faces the challenge of not only defining clear policies and guidelines about ethical and academically honest ways to use and integrate generative AI tools into university education and assessments, but also to rethink the design of assessment pieces.",

Advances in AI are rapidly changing business-to-business marketing as well, with substantial implications for business-to-business theory and practice. In an extension of Ritter and Pedersen's (2020) phases of digitalization in business-to-business firms and through conceptual integration and development, this paper argues that digitalization has entered a new phase based on the generative capabilities of AI, which produce seemingly authentic artefacts, interactions, and datasets that cannot be consistently recognized as artificial, i.e. machine created with no or limited connection to real entities such as persons and places but which can be mistaken for having such connections. The paper outlines the characteristics of this evolution of digitalization and develops a research agenda for this fifth phase of digitalization, including the need for digital authorization to moderate the development of digital authenticity into value creation.",

However, existing methods in enabling appropriate AI reliance might encounter challenges while being applied in the medical domain. With this regard, this work employs and provides the validation of an alternative approach â majority voting â to facilitate appropriate reliance on AI in medical decision-making. This is achieved by a multi-institutional user study involving 32 medical professionals with various backgrounds, focusing on the pathology task of visually detecting a pattern, mitoses, in tumor images. Here, the majority voting process was conducted by synthesizing decisions under AI assistance from a group of pathology doctors (pathologists). Two metrics were used to evaluate the appropriateness of AI reliance: Relative AI Reliance (RAIR) and Relative Self-Reliance (RSR). Results showed that even with groups of three pathologists, majority-voted decisions significantly increased both RAIR and RSR â by approximately 9% and 31%, respectively â compared to decisions made by one pathologist collaborating with AI. This increased appropriateness resulted in better precision and recall in the detection of mitoses. While our study is centered on pathology, we believe these insights can be extended to general high-stakes decision-making processes involving similar visual tasks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, we witness the proliferation of edge IoT devices, ranging from smart cameras to autonomous vehicles, with increasing computing capabilities, used to implement AI-based services in usersâ proximity, right at the edge. As these services are often computationally demanding, the popular paradigm of offloading their tasks to nearby cloud servers has gained much traction and been studied extensively. In this work, we propose a new paradigm that departs from the above typical edge computing offloading idea. Namely, we argue that it is possible to leverage these end nodes to assist larger nodes (e.g., cloudlets) in executing AI tasks. Indeed, as more and more end nodes are deployed, they create an abundance of idle computing capacity, which, when aggregated and exploited in a systematic fashion, can be proved beneficial. We introduce the idea of reverse offloading and study a scenario where a powerful node splits an AI task into a group of subtasks and assigns them to a set of nearby edge IoT nodes. The goal of each node is to minimize the overall execution time, which is constrained by the slowest subtask, while adhering to predetermined energy consumption and AI performance constraints. This is a challenging MINLP (Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem) optimization problem that we tackle with a novel approach through our newly introduced EAI-ARO (Edge AI-Adaptive Reverse Offloading) algorithm. Furthermore, a demonstration of the efficacy of our reverse offloading proposal using an edge computing testbed and a representative AI service is performed. The findings suggest that our method optimizes the systemâs performance significantly when compared with a greedy and a baseline task offloading algorithm.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (384KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The size of the integrated meta-dataset was 1.17 million tokens. The integrated and classified metadata were extracted, transformed into text, segmented to specific character lengths, and vectorized using the embedding model. The AI-guide bot was implemented using Python 3.9. To enhance the scalability and incorporate the integrated dataset, we combined the AI-guide bot with OpenAI and the LangChain framework. To generate user-friendly conversations, a language model was developed based on Chat-Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), an interactive conversational chatbot powered by GPT-3.5. The AI-guide bot was implemented using ChatGPT3.5 from Sep. 2023 to Jan. 2024.\nResults\nThe AI-guide bot allowed users to select their desired cancer type and language for conversational interactions. The AI-guided bot was designed to expand its capabilities to encompass multiple major cancer types. The performance of the AI-guide bot responses was 90.98 Â± 4.02 (obtained by summing up the Likert scores).\nConclusions\nThe AI-guide bot can provide medical information quickly and accurately to patients with cancer who are concerned about their health.",

Furthermore, these generators can produce incomplete code snippets that are challenging to evaluate using current solutions.\nObjective:\nThis research work introduces DeVAIC (Detection of Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Code), a tool to evaluate the security of AI-generated Python code, which overcomes the challenge of examining incomplete code.\nMethods:\nWe followed a methodological approach that involved gathering vulnerable samples, extracting implementation patterns, and creating regular expressions to develop the proposed tool. The implementation of DeVAIC includes a set of detection rules based on regular expressions that cover 35 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) falling under the OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories.\nResults:\nWe utilized four popular AI models to generate Python code, which we then used as a foundation to evaluate the effectiveness of our tool. DeVAIC demonstrated a statistically significant difference in its ability to detect security vulnerabilities compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, showing an\nScore and Accuracy of 94% while maintaining a low computational cost of 0.14 s per code snippet, on average.\nConclusions:\nThe proposed tool provides a lightweight and efficient solution for vulnerability detection even on incomplete code.",

Therefore, to enhance aviation control security and better deal with these problems, this research focuses on developing a strong ADS-B injection detection system. It combines XGBoost and Random Forest with Logistic Regression in an Ensemble Learning Meta-Learning Model to identify ADS-B injection risks and categorise them. Ensemble methods, which combine several models can increase the detection accuracy and robustness of the model used to identify the threat. In addition, Explainable AI (XAI) methods are employed to enhance the process of explaining how the model reaches its decisions and building trust in aviation security systems. The systemâs training, testing, and evaluation are conducted with ADS-B data. This result indicates that the Stacked Random Forest and XGBoost with Logistic Regression Meta-Learner with 99.60% accuracy, along with good recall rates (99.49%) and precision (99.41%). Also, aviation control authorities are reassured by the modelâs transparent and applicable decision logic through the application of XAI techniques. This research contributes to enhanced aviation security by proposing a new, highly accurate ADS-B injection detection system with explainable outcomes. A strategy like this can help flight control systems maintain integrity amidst an ever-digitising aviation reality.",

While collaborative decision-making (CDM) is a commonly used approach to mitigate these airline disruptions, it is unclear how artificial intelligence (AI) can support CDM to manage airline disruption. This study's purpose is to identify how the adoption of AI can support CDM to mitigate operational flight disruptions. Using a theory building approach, this conceptual paper advances the literature in aviation management by delineating the relationship between AI and CDM in the context of airline disruption management. First, we propose an AIâCDM framework illustrating the factors that influence disruption management in airlines. Second, we highlight the implications of AI-supported CDM for disruption management in and for airlines. We found that to effectively use AI-supported CDM for disruption management, airlines need to a) introduce data-driven CDM, b) enable AI management of complex systems, and c) transform disruption management into AI-supported performance management. As one of the first studies linking AI and CDM, the framework provides a structured recognition of the role of AI in CDM and its implications for airline disruption management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding successful pathways for manufacturers to capture value within the service ecosystem framework is a recent and still nascent area of research that requires further investigation and growth. Within industrial settings, artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an enabling technology that can be integrated across a network of products and systems, driving the transformation of these service ecosystems. From this perspective, this study proposes that the symbiotic convergence between AI-enabled smart manufacturing, which facilitates process and product enhancements, and servitization, which enables product availability and customization, contributes to a higher level of ecosystem value capture. To address this issue, a research model employing Smart Partial Least Squares was developed to examine the interplay between these constructs. By using survey data from a purposively selected sample of servitized manufacturing firms, the findings reveal the synergistic effects of integrating AI-enabled smart manufacturing and servitization. Furthermore, the results indicate variances across industrial sectors, and highlight that in digitally-intensive industries, service business models have undergone more substantial transformations, fostering accelerated ecosystem development streamlined by customization. Conversely, in digitally-augmented industries, where inputs are digital but products are predominantly analog, digital capabilities are primarily confined to production processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTeaching and learning in higher education require adaptation following students' inevitable use of AI chatbots. This study contributes to the empirical literature on students' use of AI chatbots and how they influence learning. The aim of this study is to identify how to adapt programming education in higher engineering education. A mixed-methods case study was conducted of a scientific computing course in a Mechanical Engineering Master's program at a Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. Data consisted of 29 student questionnaires, a semi-structured group interview with three students, a semi-structured interview with the teacher, and 29 students' grades. Results show that students used ChatGPT for error checking and debugging of code, increasing conceptual understanding, generating, and optimizing solution code, explaining code, and solving mathematical problems. While students reported advantages of using ChatGPT, the teacher expressed concerns over declining code quality and student learning. Furthermore, both students and teacher perceived a negative influence from ChatGPT usage on pair programming, and consequently on student collaboration. The findings suggest that learning objectives should be formulated in more detail, to highlight essential programming skills, and be expanded to include the use of AI tools. Complex programming assignments remain appropriate in programming education, but pair programming as a didactic approach should be reconsidered in light of the growing use of AI Chatbots.",

Several models and networks exhibited sexism, racism and other discriminatory traits in their output. Needless to say, discrimination and biases in AI must be addressed. The urgency of addressing this issue, however, is becoming more evident and pressing with the widespread adoption of AI solutions across different aspects of our lives. This paper is a gentle introduction of Fairness in AI and a survey of existing solutions. The root cause of unfair AI, is the data used to train and test the algorithms.

Limosilactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) A119, which has the LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing (QS) system and producing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), improves the beany flavor of soy protein-based fermented milk. However, the precise mechanism underlying the production of ALDH and its improvement on the beany flavor remains unclear. The test results indicate that cell density content and ALDH activity were up-regulated with increasing autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signaling molecule. This suggests that ALDH synthesis in L. fermentum A119 may be regulated by the LuxS/AI-2 QS system. Subsequently, the 4D-data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics results revealed a total of 378 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) after 24 h of incubation compared to 2 h incubation. Among them, 236 DEPs were up-regulated, including s-ribosylhomocysteinase (LuxS) and ALDH. Additionally, Western blot analysis confirmed that LuxS/AI-2 QS system successfully mediates the expression of ALDH. Finally, under the catalysis of ALDH, the beany flavor-metabolites benzaldehyde was converted to benzoic acid, which improved the flavor of soy protein-based fermented milk. This study reveals the mechanism of ALDH regulation through the LuxS/AI-2 QS system, provide new insights for reducing beany flavor in soy protein-based fermented milk.",

The employment of machine-learning-based decision-support systems (MLDSS) in medicine, however, raises important multidisciplinary challenges that cannot be addressed in isolation. We discuss three disciplinary perspectives on the topic and their interplay. Ethical issues arise at the level of changing responsibility structures in healthcare. Behavioral issues relate to the actual impact that the system has on physicians. Technical issues arise with respect to the training of a machine learning (ML) model that gives accurate advice. We argue that the interaction between physicians and MLDSS including the concrete design of the interface in which this interaction occurs can only be considered at the intersection of all three disciplines.",

By employing the Adjusted Market Inefficiency Magnitude (AMIM) and conducting quantile efficiency and liquidity analyses, we observe dynamic fluctuations in market efficiency across sectors like Generative AI, AI Big Data, Cybersecurity, and Distributed Computing. Our findings reveal that most AI-Crypto sectors present a tendency towards higher efficiency in extreme market conditions. The introduction of ChatGPT 3 significantly enhanced market efficiency, with sectors associated with AI experiencing positive mean returns and increased liquidity. Our results suggest that market efficiency in these sectors is not static but evolves with technological innovations and sector-specific characteristics, in that AI-related sectors are driving the recent market dynamics, with increased liquidity and efficiency observed post-ChatGPT 3 launch. This research extends previous work on crypto market efficiency and explores the incorporation of information in AI tokenized projects, underscoring the transformative impact of AI on the crypto market landscape.",

Workflows, advantages and limitations are identified through a comprehensive practical comparison example. The results show many similarities regarding generative capabilities and highlight several advantages of Text-to-Image AI models, including an easier way of capturing product grammars and a wider and more immediate range of further applications. In contrast, Shape Grammars approach proved more solid in aspects related to exploration workflows and cognitive stimulation.

As this area develops, new principles on responsible use of Generative AI in chemical engineering are required to ensure that traditional engineering ethics are able to accommodate the new landscape. In this perspective, we assess the current state of engineering ethics, responsible AI principles and suggest how they can combine to ensure that Generative AI can be used responsibly within the chemical engineering sector. Whilst there are many aspect to engineering ethics and responsible AI use, the core principles which include transparency, integrity, and accountability are omnipresent and provide a shared foundation of good practice on which new regulations may be built as the need arises. Future breakthrough will require development on the AI technology itself, the people-centre approach and regulation changes.",

The goal is to explore the potential implications of the spread of synthetic data in scenarios where geospatial data are essential for decoding socio-spatial changes and where Geo-visualization is pivotal for spatial decision support. The methodology is based on a) the production of a synthetic dataset and b) the evaluation of the spatial similarity with the original one. Specifically, we employ a synthetic data provider, namely Mostly.AI, alongside geospatial data related to Airbnb listings in Florence, Italy. Results show which criticalities are linked to AI-derived data compared to the original ones, highlighting crucial spatial similarities and dissimilarities. Finally, the work critically discusses the broader societal implications of the widespread online synthetic data platforms, exploring the impacts of such a technological (re)evolution in a data-intensive society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe continued progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit different aspects of society and various fields of the economy, yet pose crucial risks to both those who offer such technologies and those who use them. These risks are emphasized by the unpredictability of developments in AI technology (such as the increased level of autonomy of self-learning systems), which renders it even more difficult to build a comprehensive legal framework accounting for all potential legal and ethical issues arising from the use of AI. As such, enforcement authorities are facing increased difficulties in checking compliance with applicable legislation and assessing liability, due to the specific features of AI, â namely: complexity, opacity, autonomy, unpredictability, openness, data-drivenness, and vulnerability. These problems are particularly significant in areas, such as financial markets, in which consequences arising from malfunctioning of AI systems are likely to have a major impact both in terms of individuals' protection, and of overall market stability. This scenario challenges policymaking in an increasingly digital and global context, where it becomes difficult for regulators to predict and face the impact of AI systems on economy and society, to make sure that they are human-centric, ethical, explainable, sustainable and respectful of fundamental rights and values. The European Union has been dedicating increased attention to filling the gap between the existing legal framework and AI. Some of the legislative proposals in consideration call for preventive legislation and introduce obligations on different actors â such as the AI Act â while others have a compensatory scope and seek to build a liability framework â such as the proposed AI Liability Directive and revised Product Liability Directive. At the same time, cross-sectorial regulations shall coexist with sector-specific initiatives, and the rules they establish. The present paper starts by assessing the fit of the existing European liability regime(s) with the constantly evolving AI landscape, by identifying the normative foundations on which a liability regime for such technology should be built on. It then addresses the proposed additions and revisions to the legislation, focusing on how they seek to govern AI systems, with a major focus on their implications on highly-regulated complex systems such as financial markets. Finally, it considers potential additional measures that could continue to strike a balance between the interests of all parties, namely by seeking to reduce the inherent risks that accompany the use of AI and to leverage its major benefits for our society and economy.",

Developing high-quality AI-enabled systems â software systems embedding one or multiple AI components, algorithms, and models â could introduce critical challenges for mitigating specific risks related to the systemsâ quality. Such development alone is insufficient to fully address socio-technical consequences and the need for rapid adaptation to evolutionary changes. Recent work proposed the concept of AI technical debt, a potential liability concerned with developing AI-enabled systems whose impact can affect the overall systemsâ quality. While the problem of AI technical debt is rapidly gaining the attention of the software engineering research community, scientific knowledge that contributes to understanding and managing the matter is still limited.\nObjective:\nIn this paper, we leverage the expertise of practitioners to offer useful insights to the research community, aiming to enhance researchersâ awareness about the detection and mitigation of AI technical debt. Our ultimate goal is to empower practitioners by providing them with tools and methods. Additionally, our study sheds light on novel aspects that practitioners might not be fully acquainted with, contributing to a deeper understanding of the subject.\nMethod:\nWe develop a survey study featuring 53 AI practitioners, in which we collect information on the practical prevalence, severity, and impact of AI technical debt issues affecting the code and the architecture other than the strategies applied by practitioners to identify and mitigate them.\nResults:\nThe key findings of the study reveal the multiple impacts that AI technical debt issues may have on the quality of AI-enabled systems (e.g., the high negative impact that Undeclared consumers has on security, whereas Jumbled Model Architecture can induce the code to be hard to maintain) and the little support practitioners have to deal with them, limited to apply manual effort for identification and refactoring.\nConclusion:\nWe conclude the article by distilling lessons learned and actionable insights for researchers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nHumans have developed and employed manuals to systematically organize, standardize, and transfer knowledge for decision-making in organizations. These manuals and standards have served as a \"conventional copilot\" for humansâ intellectual activities, taking the form of collected references or operational procedures. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a \"novel copilot\" that aids humans in organizations. Given the two non-human supports, this article aims to redefine the relational dynamics among the trio (human, manuals/standards, and AI). It analyzes and suggests that, rather than the new copilot (AI) making the old one (manuals/standards) obsolete, the trio needs to collaborate and complement one another to sustain accountabilities in terms of contingency, competence, and stewardship.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nVertical Broken Access Control (VBAC) vulnerability is one of the most commonly identified issues in web applications, posing significant risks. Consequently, addressing this pervasive threat is crucial for ensuring system confidentiality and integrity. Broken access control attack detector (BACAD) is a novel framework that leverages advanced AI techniques to neutralize VBAC exploits and attacks in real-time using a dynamic and practical technique. The detection process consists of two steps. The first step is user role classification using an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model created in a learning phase. The learning phase includes BACAD initial configuration and application user roles traffic generation used for AI model training. The AI model at the core of BACAD analyzes web requests and responses utilizing a robust feature extraction, and dynamic hyperparameter tuning to ensure optimal performance across diverse scenarios. The second step is the decision step, which determines whether the incoming requestâresponse pair is benign or an attack by validating it vs the BACAD session information set. The evaluation against a spectrum of real-world and demonstration web applications highlights remarkable efficiency in detecting VBAC exploits, providing robust application protection against different sets of VBAC attacks. Furthermore, it shows that BACAD addresses the VBAC problem by presenting an applicable, dynamic, flexible, and technology-independent solution to counter VBAC vulnerability risks. Thus, BACAD contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing web application security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, capable of an unprecedented ability to generate human-like text and converse in real time, hold potential for large-scale deployment in clinical settings such as substance use treatment. Treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) is particularly high stakes, requiring evidence-based clinical treatment, mental health expertise, and peer support. Thus, promises of AI systems addressing deficient healthcare resources and structural bias are relevant within this domain, especially in an anonymous setting. This study explores the effectiveness of generative AI in answering real-world substance use and recovery questions. We collect questions from online recovery forums, use ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMA-2 for responses, and have SUD clinicians rate these AI responses. While clinicians rated the AI-generated responses as high quality, we discovered instances of dangerous disinformation, including disregard for suicidal ideation, incorrect emergency helplines, and endorsement of home detox. Moreover, the AI systems produced inconsistent advice depending on question phrasing. These findings indicate a risky mix of seemingly high-quality, accurate responses upon initial inspection that contain inaccurate and potentially deadly medical advice. Consequently, while generative AI shows promise, its real-world application in sensitive healthcare domains necessitates further safeguards and clinical validation.",

This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of oral cancer. We investigated three data cleaning techniques missing value imputation, outlier detection, and normalization and assessed their impact on model performance. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests, we compared the effectiveness of these techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and mean squared error (MSE). The results demonstrated that normalization, specifically min-max scaling, was the most effective method, leading to the highest accuracy (94 %) and the lowest MSE (0.013) for CNN models. Outlier detection also improved performance, achieving 93 % accuracy and an MSE of 0.014, while missing value imputation resulted in a lower accuracy of 92 % and an MSE of 0.015. These findings underscore the importance of normalization in preprocessing for machine learning models, highlighting its role in achieving superior performance in oral cancer detection. This study underscores the potential of AI-driven methods to revolutionize diagnostic practices, offering more accurate and timely detection of oral cancer.",

Lung diseases, often elusive in their early stages, pose a significant public health challenge. Recent advancements in AI have ushered in innovative methods for early detection, yet the black-box nature of many AI models limits their clinical applicability. XAI emerges as a pivotal tool, enhancing transparency and interpretability in AI-driven diagnostics. This review synthesizes current research on the application of XAI in analyzing vocal biomarkers for lung diseases, highlighting how these techniques elucidate the connections between specific vocal features and lung pathology. We critically examine the methodologies employed, the types of lung diseases studied, and the performance of various XAI models. The potential for XAI to aid in early detection, monitor disease progression, and personalize treatment strategies in pulmonary medicine is emphasized. Furthermore, this review identifies current challenges, including data heterogeneity and model generalizability, and proposes future directions for research. By offering a comprehensive analysis of explainable AI features in the context of lung disease detection, this review aims to bridge the gap between advanced computational approaches and clinical practice, paving the way for more transparent, reliable, and effective diagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nGenomic prediction of daughter pregnancy rate (GDPR) and cow conception rate (GCCR) are fertility traits developed to help improve selection for reproductive performance. Although these traits overlap, their denominator can vary, and programs with different strategies combining estrus detection (ED) and timed AI might experience different associations with these traits (e.g., shorter interval for 1st service for high GDPR quartiles, but not for GCCR). The objectives were to assess days from calving to first service (TP1), AI at estrus detection (AIE), pregnancy at the first service (P1), pregnancy loss for the first service (PL), and number of services to conception (NSFC) in 2 reproductive programs (RepP) combining variable ED length and timed AI (TAI) and their relationship with GDPR and GCCR. Holstein cows from a single farm were randomly allocated to 2 different programs, the Short RepP (n = 982) or Long RepP (n = 942). In the Short RepP, cows were enrolled in a Presynch-Ovsynch (PGF2Î±:36 Â± 3 and 50 Â± 3 DIM) followed by ED and AI from 50 Â± 3 to 62 Â± 3; Cows not detected in estrus underwent in the Ovsynch (GnRH:62 Â± 3, PGF2Î±:69 Â± 3, GnRH:71 Â± 3 and TAI:72 Â± 3 DIM). In the Long RepP, cows received a PGF2Î± at 50 Â± 3 followed by AI at ED up to 81 Â± 3. Cows with no ED were enrolled in an Ovsynch (GnRH:82 Â± 3, PGF2Î±:89 Â± 3, GnRH:91 Â± 3 and TAI:92 Â± 3 DIM). Cows were categorized into quartiles (Q1 to Q4) considering their GDPR (qGDPR) and GCCR (qGCCR). Statistical analyses included logistic regression used for AIE, P1, and PL; Poisson regression for the NSFC; and linear regression for TP1. Models included AIE, P1, PL, NSFC, and TP1 as dependent variables, with RepP and qGDPR for GDPR and RepP and qGCCR for GCCR as independent variables. Time to pregnancy was analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard model. The Short RepP had a shorter TP1 (Short = 64.3 vs. Long = 72.1) and fewer NSFC than the Long RepP (Short = 2.9 vs. Long = 3.1). The Long RepP had a higher AIE (Short = 45.2% vs. Long = 73.2%). The P1 tended (P = 0.09) to be greater in the Short than the Long RepP (Short = 33.7% vs. Long = 30.0%). Cows in Q4 (GDPR and GCCR) had lower TP1 and NSFC, greater AIE and P1 compared with the lowest quartiles (Q1). Interactions between RepP and GDPR were present for TP1, AIE, and P1, but no interactions were observed between RepP and GCCR. The short program had a shorter interval from calving to pregnancy than the Long program. Cows in the highest quartiles for GDPR and GCCR had shorter intervals from calving to pregnancy and higher pregnancy hazards than the lowest quartiles. The current study revealed that cows enrolled in Long RepP that relied on longer ED intervals had lower reproductive outcomes than Short RepP, and cows ranked in the highest GDPR and GCCR quartile for most responses had better outcomes independent of the RepP used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent years have seen a surge in research on artificial intelligence (AI)-driven business model innovation (BMI), reflecting its profound impact across industries. However, the fieldâs current state remains fragmented due to varied conceptual lenses and units of analysis. Existing literature predominantly emphasizes the technological aspects of AI implementation in business models (BMs), treating BMI as a byproduct. Additionally, there is a lack of coherent understanding regarding the scope of BMI propelled by AI. To address these gaps, our study systematically reviews 180 articles, offering two key contributions: (1) a structured analysis of evolving research dimensions in AI-driven BMI, differentiating between static and dynamic views of BMI, and (2) a framework presenting distinct research perspectives on AI-driven BMI, each addressing specific managerial focuses. This synthesis facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the field, enabling the identification of research gaps and proposing future avenues for advancing knowledge on the management of AI-driven BMI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of large language models (LLMs) and conversational applications, like ChatGPT, prompts Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, such as NICE, to rethink how healthcare professionals access clinical guidance. Integrating LLMs into systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers potential solutions to current LLMsâ problems, like the generation of false or misleading information. The objective of this paper is to design and debate the potential rollout of an AI-driven system, similar to ChatGPT, to enhance the uptake of clinical guidance within the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. Conversational interfaces, powered by LLMs, offer healthcare practitioners clear benefits over traditional ways of getting clinical guidance, such as easy navigation through long documents, blending information from various trusted sources, or expediting evidence-based decisions in situ. But, putting these interfaces into practice brings new challenges for HTA bodies, like assuring quality, addressing data privacy concerns, navigating existing resource constraints, or preparing the organization for innovative practices. Rigorous empirical evaluations are necessary to validate their effectiveness in increasing the uptake of clinical guidance among healthcare practitioners A feasible evaluation strategy is elucidated in this research while its implementation remains as future work.",

The specific aim is to evaluate the performance, ethical considerations, and clinical implementation of AI-driven retina disease detection systems.\nMethods\nThis study is a systematic review. Data sources assessed included various electronic databases searched up to July 31, 2023. The prespecified criteria for study inclusion were studies involving AI algorithms for retina disease detection, including those focused on diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. Participant eligibility criteria encompassed human subjects of all ages, and the interventions assessed were AI-based diagnostic tools compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Only randomized controlled trials and observational studies set in clinical environments were included, covering a time span from the inception of AI technology.\nFindings\nThe search identified 145 studies, of which 61 met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for analysis. The narrative summary of findings indicated that AI algorithms generally demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting retinal diseases. Deep learning algorithms showed a sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of 98 % for diabetic retinopathy detection. However, several studies highlighted concerns about algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the need for diverse and representative datasets to ensure generalizability across different populations.\nInterpretation\nThe AI-driven retina disease detection systems have significant potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Ethical considerations regarding patient privacy, the risk of algorithmic bias, and the challenges of integrating AI into existing healthcare workflows must be addressed. The study underscores the importance of ongoing validation, ethical scrutiny, and interdisciplinary collaboration to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks, ensuring responsible and equitable implementation in clinical settings.",

We explain how the literature discusses fairness, transparency, non-maleficence, responsibility, privacy, trust, beneficence, and freedom/autonomy. Conceptualizations vary along social/technical- and process/outcome-oriented dimensions. The main stakeholders of ethics-based AI auditing are system developers and deployers, the wider public, researchers, auditors, AI system users, and regulators. AI auditing provides three types of knowledge contributions to stakeholders: 1) guidance; 2) methods, tools, and frameworks; and 3) awareness and empowerment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the increasing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various aspects of society, understanding public attitudes towards AI becomes crucial. This study investigated attitudes towards AI among Hong Kong middle-aged and older adults. In June 2023, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 740 smartphone users aged 45 years or older (Max = 78) in Hong Kong. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found three factors from the General Attitude to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) - Perils, Power, and Promises. Subsequently, with latent profile analysis we revealed three latent profiles: (i) Enthusiasts (18.4%; high on Promises and Power but low on Perils); (ii) Skeptics (12.3%; high on Perils but low on Promises and Power), and (iii) Indecisive (69.3%; moderate on all three factors). The Enthusiasts were more likely to be male, with higher socio-economic status, better self-rated health, and greater mobile device proficiency, optimism, innovativeness, but also less insecurity with technology, compared to the Indecisive, and then to the Skeptics. Our findings suggest that most middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong hold an ambivalent view towards AI, appreciating its power and potentials while also cognizant of the perils it may entail. Our findings are timely considering the recent debates on ethical use of AI evoked by smart phone applications such as ChatGPT and will be valuable for practitioners and scholars for developing inclusive AI-facilitated services and applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMental disorders impact a large proportion of individuals worldwide, with young adults being particularly susceptible to poor mental health. Past research shows that help-seeking self-stigma plays a vital role in deterring help-seeking among young adults; however, this relationship has primarily been examined in the context of human-delivered psychotherapy. The present study aimed to understand how young adultsâ perceptions of help-seeking self-stigma associated with different modes of psychotherapy, specifically human-delivered and artificial intelligence (AI)-delivered, influence attitudes towards using AI chatbots for psychotherapy. This study employed a cross-sectional survey design to measure perceived help-seeking self-stigma and attitudes towards both human- and AI-delivered psychotherapy. The results demonstrated that high help-seeking self-stigma associated with human-delivered psychotherapy was linked to more negative attitudes towards human-delivered psychotherapy but more positive attitudes towards AI-delivered psychotherapy. Moreover, high help-seeking self-stigma associated with AI-delivered psychotherapy was linked to more negative attitudes towards AI-delivered psychotherapy but more positive attitudes towards human-delivered psychotherapy. These findings have important real-world implications for future clinical practice and mental health service delivery. The results indicate that young adults who are reluctant to engage with human-delivered psychotherapy due to help-seeking self-stigma may be more inclined to seek help through alternative modes of psychotherapy, such as AI chatbots. Limitations and future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nGenerative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI), exemplified by the widely adopted ChatGPT, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Its application spans various health education domains, including pharmacy, where its potential benefits and drawbacks have become increasingly apparent. Despite the growing adoption of Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education, there remains a critical need to assess and mitigate associated risks. This review exploresthe literature and potential strategies for mitigating risks associated with the integration of Gen-AI in pharmacy education.\nAim\nTo conduct a scoping review to identify implications of Gen-AI in pharmacy education, identify its use and emerging evidence, with a particular focus on strategies which mitigate potential risks to academic integrity.\nMethods\nA scoping review strategy was employed in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Databases searched includedPubMed, ERIC [Education Resources Information Center], Scopus and ProQuestfrom August 2023 to 20 February 2024 and included all relevant records from 1 January 2000 to 20 February 2024 relating specifically to LLM use within pharmacy education. A grey literature search was also conducted due to the emerging nature of this topic. Policies, procedures, and documents from institutions such as universities and colleges, including standards, guidelines, and policy documents, were hand searched and reviewed in their most updated form. These documents were not published in the scientific literature or indexed in academic search engines.\nResults\nArticles (n = 12) were derived from the scientific data bases and Records (n = 9) derived from the grey literature. Potential use and benefits of Gen-AI within pharmacy education were identified in all included published articles however there was a paucity of published articles related the degree of consideration to the potential risks to academic integrity. Grey literature recordsheld the largest proportion of risk mitigation strategies largely focusing on increased academic and student education and training relating to the ethical use of Gen-AI as well considerations for redesigning of current assessments likely to be a risk for Gen-AI use to academic integrity.\nConclusion\nDrawing upon existing literature, this review highlights the importance of evidence-based approaches to address the challenges posed by Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education settings. Additionally, whilst mitigation strategies are suggested, primarily drawn from the grey literature, there is a paucity of traditionally published scientific literature outlining strategies for the practical and ethical implementation of Gen-AI within pharmacy education. Further research related to the responsible and ethical use of Gen-AI in pharmacy curricula; and studies related to strategies adopted to mitigate risks to academic integrity would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a critical global health crisis. An innovative strategy to deal with AMR is to interfere with biofilm formation and bacterial quorum sensing (QS). In this study, newly designed autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-inspired compounds in targeting biofilm-associated infections were evaluated for their ability to inhibit biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most effective compounds, 5d, 5e, and 7b, exhibited potent antibiofilm activity with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the low microgram per mL range. Detailed biological assays confirmed that the antibiofilm activity was primarily driven through AI-2 QS inhibition rather than direct antimicrobial effects. The combination of different spectroscopic techniques, such as differential scanning fluorimetry, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance, elucidated the binding between the compounds and the LsrK enzyme, a key player in AI-2 mediated QS. Our findings highlight the potential of these novel QS inhibitors as promising therapeutic agents against biofilm-associated infections.\nDownload: Download high-res image (98KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nDownload: Download high-res image (98KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed digital marketing enhancing its effectiveness and raising new ethical and privacy concerns. This study investigates the ethical implications of AI-based digital marketing, particularly focusing on user privacy. In terms of methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify relevant variables, followed by Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) using R within the framework of homogeneity analysis of variance using alternating least squares (HOMALS). The MCA analysis identified 3 multivariate groupings, and 21 individual variables extracted from 28 studies. The MCA identified a total of 4 clusters in the eigenvalues/variances analysis, and 5 clusters in the biplot analysis. The findings emphasize the need for a balanced approach that respects user privacy and ethical use of data when developing actions using AI-based digital marketing. However, no significant relationship is evident between the study of variables such as cross-device tracking or data-driven technologies and, the ethics of AI-based digital marketing, despite these being the most profitable actions in this environment. There is no evidence of developing personalized social media content or ads linked to privacy standards. However, a strong connection between behavioral analytics, smart content and metaverse is identified, highlighting the risks of this emerging technology in this research field, as it is not linked to privacy or ethics. Among the results, the strong proximity of real-time tracking, IoT, and surveillance variables underscores the critical need to ethically understand how user behavior in real-time is being monitored, as they do not offer a strong link to privacy or ethics. Additionally, this study provides 21 future research questions that address whether these practices are being ethically implemented, following standards like âprivacy-by-defaultâ or âprivacy-by-design,â and complying with privacy laws in AI-based digital marketing. To ensure these practices align with ethical standards, it is essential to adopt frameworks prioritizing data dignity, which calls for treating user data as an extension of personal identity, requiring responsible and ethical handling throughout the data collection and processing lifecycle.",

While many AI literacy assessment tools have been developed in the last 2-3 years, mostly in the form of self-assessment scales and less frequently as knowledge-based assessments, previous approaches only accounted for one specific area of a comprehensive understanding of AI competence, namely cognitive aspects within generic AI literacy. Considering the demand for AI literacy development for different professional domains and reflecting on the concept of competence in a way that goes beyond mere cognitive aspects of conceptual knowledge, there is an urgent need for assessment methods that capture domain-specific AI literacy on each of the three competence dimensions of cognition, behavior, and attitude. In addition, competencies for AI ethics are becoming more apparent, which further calls for a comprehensive assessment of AI literacy for this very matter. This conceptual paper aims to provide a foundation upon which future AI literacy assessment instruments can be built and provides insights into what a framework for item development might look like that addresses both generic and domain-specific aspects of AI literacy as well as AI ethics literacy, and measures more than just knowledge-related aspects based on a holistic approach.",

Yet, it remains unclear how well the emerging general-purpose AI technologies can perform object counting, which is a fundamental task in agricultural digitalization, in comparison to the current standard practice. We show that ChatGPT (GPT4 V) demonstrated moderate performance in counting coffee cherries from images, while the T-Rex, foundation model for object counting, performed with high accuracy. Testing with a hundred images, we examined that ChatGPT can count cherries, and the performance improves with human feedback (R2 = 0.36 and 0.46, respectively). The T-Rex foundation model required only a few samples for training but outperformed YOLOv8, the conventional best practice model (R2 = 0.92 and 0.90, respectively). Obtaining the results with these models was 100x shorter than the conventional best practice. These results bring two surprises for deep learning users in applied domains: a foundation model can drastically save effort and achieve higher accuracy than a conventional approach, and ChatGPT can reveal a relatively good performance especially with guidance by providing some examples and feedback. No requirement for coding skills can impact education, outreach, and real-world implementation of generative AI for supporting farmers.",

However, there is little rigorous work that analyses the enablers that promote AIâHI integration and application in the HSC. Thus, this paper reports a hybrid decision support framework for analysing enablers of AIâHI integration in the HSC with complicated, uncertain, and periodic information. First, to collect interdependent preference data from experts, the complex spherical fuzzy weighted Heronian mean operator with a weighted distance measures-based optimization model is established to generate a group decision matrix. Next, to measure the influence strength of enablers, a complex spherical fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation method is established to determine enabler weights, taking into account their interactive relationships. After that, to explore the enabler level of AIâHI integration in different participants of the HSC, the complex spherical fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution method is developed by combining the former two procedures. Finally, a case study of enablers analysis for AIâHI integration in HSC is presented to assess the feasibility of the current method, which includes sensitivity and comparison studies. The results reveal that the factor âenhancing the efficiency of relief operationsâ (0.084) is the most important driving factor for AIâHI integration. The outcomes of this study can provide a new decision support method for understanding the enablers of AIâHI integration in key parts of the HSC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational paradigms, this study explores AI-based chatbot adoption in higher education among students and educators. Employing a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, the research focuses on developing and validating a comprehensive model to understand the multifaceted factors impacting the acceptance and use of these chatbots. The methodology integrates an extensive literature review, construction of a theoretical model, administration of a detailed questionnaire to a representative sample from the higher education sector, coupled with advanced SEM techniques for data analysis and interpretation. The SEM analysis validates the model's robustness and highlights the relationships between several key factors affecting users' perspectives and chatbots adoption. Results reveal a predominantly positive perception towards AI-chatbots among both students and educators, underscoring the potential to substantially enrich their educational journey. However, it also uncovers critical concerns pertaining to trust, privacy, response bias, and information accuracy. Moreover, the study offers valuable insights into how moderators such as technological proficiency, user roles, and gender influence the adoption model relationships. This emphasizes the need for customizing AI-chatbots deployment to meet the diverse needs of users effectively. Contributing a robust framework for understanding users' perceptions towards AI-chatbots and their adoption patterns, this study offers actionable insights for educational leaders, policymakers, and technology developers. It also lays the groundwork for future research, including longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term impact of these technologies, investigations into their effect on learning outcomes, and explorations of the ethical and privacy considerations involved.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nAlgorithmic strategies, such as style control and counterfactual role reversal, effectively enhance large language models' capabilities in promoting diversity, safety, positive sentiment, and anti-stereotype content.\nâ¢\nUsers of conversational AI demonstrate greater visual attention compared to those in the control group.\nâ¢\nFeatures grounded in induction, concretization, and exemplification are perceived as particularly helpful by participants.\nâ¢\nHigh-performing participants engaged in a dynamic, interactive learning process with the ConvAI, leveraging its responses to deepen their understanding of conceptual and procedural knowledge, seek performance suggestions, and request learning advice, underscoring its role as a facilitator of Algebra learning.\nAbstract\nThe importance and challenge of Algebra learning is widely recognized, with students across the U.S. facing difficulties due to the subjectâs complexity. While extensive research has focused on enhancing Algebra learning in K-12 education, the reusability, scalability, and effectiveness of the strategies employed (e.g., manual interventions and digital tutoring platforms) remain limited. Conversational AI (ConvAI), enabled by the advancement of large language models (LLMs), emerges as a potential tool for automatic, personalized, and effective student support. However, ethical concerns surrounding diversity, safety, sentiment, and stereotype associated with ConvAI are prominent, and empirical studies examining its application in education are scarce. The purpose of this study is to develop a ConvAI system that mitigates the potential ethical concerns and empirically evaluate the effect of such a system for math learning. Specifically, we first examined computational strategies to mitigate the ethical concerns of ConvAI in educational setting with educational big data (npretraining = 2,097,139) and found that researchers could effectively enhance ConvAI responsibility through the investigated algorithmic strategies. Then, a ConvAI system was constructed using these strategies, guided by learning sciences principles. Lastly, we examined studentsâ eye-tracking patterns, acceptance, and learning processes when using this ConvAI system to learn Algebra through a random experiment (nparticipant = 151). Participants using the developed ConvAI demonstrated generally increased visual attention levels as compared to the control group. Moreover, participants expressed a positive acceptance towards the ConvAI technology. Finally, participantsâ interaction patterns with the ConvAI technology influenced their Algebra learning. These results provide insights for both educational researchers and practitioners to integrate ConvAI in learning environments.",

Understanding these limitations and their interrelationships is crucial for enhancing AI implementation. Despite growing research, there is a lack of a comprehensive model that systematically identifies and elucidates the factors influencing AI limitations in business environments. This study employs Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), combined with MICMAC analysis and an extensive literature review, to develop such a model. We identified 15 key factors and analyzed their driving and dependence powers to understand their interrelationships. Most factors, such as contextual understanding, transparency, intuition, emotional intelligence, ethics, bias, tacit knowledge, creativity, credibility, and reliability, were found to be autonomous. Accountability and privacy emerged as the strongest driving forces, while trust and adaptability exhibited the highest dependence and lowest driving power. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of AI limitations and their interrelationships, providing valuable insights for managers and businesses. The findings can aid in making more informed decisions about AI implementation and in developing strategies to mitigate these limitations. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of combining AI with human insight to overcome these challenges. However, using the ISM technique could involve subjective judgment from the experts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite the wave of enthusiasm for the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in reshaping education, critical voices urge a more tempered approach. This study investigates the less-discussed 'shadows' of AI implementation in educational settings, focusing on potential negatives that may accompany its integration. Through a multi-phased exploration consisting of content analysis and survey research, the study develops and validates a theoretical model that pinpoints several areas of concern. The initial phase, a systematic literature review, yielded 56 relevant studies from which the model was crafted. The subsequent survey with 260 participants from a Saudi Arabian university aimed to validate the model. Findings confirm concerns about human connection, data privacy and security, algorithmic bias, transparency, critical thinking, access equity, ethical issues, teacher development, reliability, and the consequences of AI-generated content. They also highlight correlations between various AI-associated concerns, suggesting intertwined consequences rather than isolated issues. For instance, enhancements in AI transparency could simultaneously support teacher professional development and foster better student outcomes. Furthermore, the study acknowledges the transformative potential of AI but cautions against its unexamined adoption in education. It advocates for comprehensive strategies to maintain human connections, ensure data privacy and security, mitigate biases, enhance system transparency, foster creativity, reduce access disparities, emphasize ethics, prepare teachers, ensure system reliability, and regulate AI-generated content. Such strategies underscore the need for holistic policymaking to leverage AI's benefits while safeguarding against its disadvantages.",

AI-powered applications are being deployed to aid Medical Radiation Technologists (MRTs) in clinical workflows, decision-making, dose optimisation, and a wide range of other tasks. Exploring the levels of AI education provided across the United States is crucial to prepare future graduates to deliver the digital future. This study aims to assess educatorsâ levels of AI knowledge, the current state of AI educational provisions, the perceived challenges around AI education, and important factors for future advancements.\nMethods\nAn online survey was electronically administered to all radiologic technologists in the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) database who indicated that they had an educator role in the United States. This was distributed through the membership of the ASRT, from February to April 2023. All quantitative data was analysed using frequency and descriptive statistics. The survey's open-ended questions were analysed using a conceptual content analysis approach.\nResults\nOut of 5,066 educators in the ASRT database, 373 valid responses were received, resulting in a response rate of 7.4%. Despite 84.5% of educators expressing the importance of teaching AI, 23.7% currently included AI in academic curricula. Of the 76.3% that did not include AI in their curricula, lack of AI knowledge among educators was the top reason for not integrating AI in education (59.1%). Similarly, AI-enabled tools were utilised by only 11.1% of the programs to assist teaching. The levels of trust in AI varied among educators.\nConclusion\nThe study found that although US educators of MRTs have a good baseline knowledge of general concepts regarding AI, they could improve on the teaching and use of AI in their curricula. AI training and guidance, adequate time to develop educational resources, and funding and support from higher education institutions were key priorities as highlighted by educators.\nRÃSUMÃ\nIntroduction\nL'intelligence artificielle (IA) rÃ©volutionne l'imagerie mÃ©dicale et la radiothÃ©rapie. Des applications alimentÃ©es par l'IA sont dÃ©ployÃ©es pour aider les technologues en radiation mÃ©dicale (TRM) dans les flux de travail cliniques, la prise de dÃ©cision, l'optimisation des doses et un large Ã©ventail d'autres tÃ¢ches. L'exploration des niveaux d'Ã©ducation Ã  l'IA fournis Ã  travers les Ãtats-Unis est cruciale pour prÃ©parer les futurs diplÃ´mÃ©s Ã  offrir l'avenir numÃ©rique. Cette Ã©tude vise Ã  Ã©valuer les niveaux de connaissance des Ã©ducateurs en matiÃ¨re d'IA, l'Ã©tat actuel des dispositions Ã©ducatives en matiÃ¨re d'IA, les dÃ©fis perÃ§us autour de l'Ã©ducation Ã  l'IA et les facteurs importants pour les progrÃ¨s futurs.\nMÃ©thodologie\nUne enquÃªte en ligne a Ã©tÃ© menÃ©e auprÃ¨s de tous les technologues en radiologie figurant dans la base de donnÃ©es de l'American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) et ayant indiquÃ© qu'ils jouaient un rÃ´le d'Ã©ducateur aux Ãtats-Unis. L'enquÃªte a Ã©tÃ© distribuÃ©e aux membres de l'ASRT de fÃ©vrier Ã  avril 2023. Toutes les donnÃ©es quantitatives ont Ã©tÃ© analysÃ©es Ã  l'aide de statistiques de frÃ©quence et de statistiques descriptives. Les questions ouvertes de l'enquÃªte ont Ã©tÃ© analysÃ©es Ã  l'aide d'une approche conceptuelle d'analyse de contenu.\nRÃ©sultats\nSur les 5066 Ã©ducateurs figurant dans la base de donnÃ©es de l'ASRT, 373 rÃ©ponses valides ont Ã©tÃ© reÃ§ues, soit un taux de rÃ©ponse de 7,4%. Bien que 84,5% des Ã©ducateurs rÃ©pondants aient exprimÃ© l'importance d'enseigner l'IA, 23,7% d'entre eux ont actuellement inclus l'IA dans leur programme d'Ã©tudes. Parmi les 76,3% qui n'ont pas inclus l'IA dans leurs programmes, le manque de connaissances des Ã©ducateurs en matiÃ¨re d'IA Ã©tait la principale raison de ne pas intÃ©grer l'IA dans l'enseignement (59,1%). De mÃªme, les outils basÃ©s sur l'IA n'ont Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©s que par 11,1% des programmes pour faciliter l'enseignement. Les niveaux de confiance envers l'IA varient d'un Ã©ducateur Ã  l'autre.\nConclusion\nL'Ã©tude a rÃ©vÃ©lÃ© que, bien que les Ã©ducateurs amÃ©ricains de TRM aient une bonne connaissance de base des concepts gÃ©nÃ©raux concernant l'IA, ils pourraient amÃ©liorer l'enseignement et l'utilisation de l'IA dans leurs programmes. La formation et l'orientation en matiÃ¨re d'IA, le temps nÃ©cessaire Ã  l'Ã©laboration de ressources pÃ©dagogiques, ainsi que le financement et le soutien des Ã©tablissements d'enseignement supÃ©rieur sont les principales prioritÃ©s mises de l'avant par les Ã©ducateurs.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop a reliable method for distinguishing between AI-generated, paraphrased, and human-written texts, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of research and ensuring accurate information flow in critical fields such as healthcare. To achieve this, we propose HybridGAD, a novel hybrid model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) architectures with an attention mechanism. Our methodology involves training this hybrid model on a dataset of radiology abstracts, encompassing texts generated by AI, paraphrased by AI, and written by humans. The major findings of our analysis indicate that HybridGAD achieves a high accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. This high performance is attributed to the modelâs ability to effectively capture the contextual nuances and structural differences between AI-generated and human-written texts. In conclusion, HybridGAD not only enhances the accuracy of text classification in the field of radiology but also paves the way for more advanced medical diagnostic processes by ensuring the authenticity of textual information. Future research will focus on integrating textual and visual data for comprehensive radiology assessments and improving model generalization with partially labeled data. This study underscores the potential of HybridGAD in transforming medical text classification and highlights its applicability in ensuring the integrity and reliability of research in healthcare and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in various domains of our lives has prompted a need for a shift towards a human-centered and trustworthy approach to AI. In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the systemâs predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge usersâ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly used in conservation practices, e.g., to prevent poaching or inventory wildlife. Another area of application is using AI to decode animal vocalisations to understand betterâand subsequently better protectâthe animals. It has already been applied to different species, including various whale species.\nWhales have complex vocalisations that are used for sexual selection, to coo their young, for echolocation, and as a form of communication. Scientists are deploying underwater microphones (hydrophones), robotic fish, and tags to record whale vocalisation. AI is used to identify whale vocalisation patterns, understand their meaning, and digitally recreate these sounds to communicate with them. Understanding and translating whale vocalisations into something humanly understandable aims at helping to identify their movements to protect them from ship strikes and bycatch and prevent or reduce sonar that interferes with their echolocation.\nUsing AI holds potential benefits, but it also comes with several risks. We describe current projects that use AI to decipher the vocalisations of humpback and sperm whales (Section 3). We introduce six ethical challenges of applying AI to decode whale vocalisations and highlight what needs to be addressed to establish these practices responsibly (Section 4). These challenges are anthropomorphism, privacy rights, cultural and emotional harm to whales, technological solutionism, ineffectiveness for whale conservation, and gender bias.\nThis paper critically evaluates the use of AI to analyse whale vocalisation, concluding that using AI to decode whale vocalisations holds many benefits for whale conservation; however, using AI to try to speak with whales is ethically problematic because of the potential emotional, physical, and cultural harm caused to whales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe public release of ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbot technologies has been accompanied by questions about how academic integrity and student cheating behaviors will be impacted. We analyzed anonymous survey data from three high schools to see if self-reported cheating numbers changed following the introduction of ChatGPT and similar technologies. This survey data set is unique in that data on cheating had been collected with this set of schools both before and after November 2022, when ChatGPT was publicly released and drew attention to these educational concerns. The results suggested that cheating behaviors remained relatively stable after the introduction of this current generation of generative AI chatbot technology. However, some changes in reported behaviors differed depending on the type of cheating (social cheating, AI-related cheating, etc.). Additional survey questions about high school studentsâ AI chatbot usage and the perceived allowability of such technology revealed mixed opinions on the acceptability of using AI for various academic-related tasks. Most students did not think that using a chatbot to produce an entire paper or complete an entire assignment should be allowable. However, there was support for using AI chatbots to help students to start on assignments and papers and to help explain new concepts to them.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing innovation management by reshaping organizational structures and processes. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily focused on automation and prediction, GenAI introduces the capability to create new content, ideas, and solutions, profoundly impacting industries reliant on creativity and problem-solving. As organizations integrate GenAI, human agency and organizational dynamics play a critical role in determining the technologyâs impact, raising key questions about its appropriation in various contexts. This paper explores the role of GenAI in innovation management through the lens of Technology Appropriation, a specific application of Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST), which analyzes how technology and organizational structures mutually shape each other. The study emphasizes the importance of human-centered models for understanding the socio-technical dynamics involved in GenAI appropriation. It identifies customization, reinterpretation, and power dynamics as critical factors influencing the successful integration of GenAI across industries. The paper also outlines future research directions, focusing on diversity in AI adoption, the customization of GenAI in innovation processes, and the ethical and regulatory challenges posed by its widespread use. By examining how individuals and organizations adapt and reconfigure GenAI to fit specific needs, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the reciprocal relationship between technology and human agency, offering insights into the transformative potential of GenAI in enhancing innovation.",

Using demographic, socio-economic and health data (including COVID-19 PCR test results and available, symptom data), we developed predictive models for the purpose of COVID-19 case identification using the following approaches: classical multivariate logistic regression (LR); deep neural network (DNN); random forest (RF); and gradient boosting trees (GBT). Model performance comparisons were made using the area under the curve (AUC) swarm plot for 10-fold cross-validation.\nResults\nThe cohort consisted of n = 351,248 Ottawa residents tested for COVID-19 during the study period. Among whom, a total of n = 883,879 unique COVID-19 tests were performed (2.6 % positive test results). Inclusion of COVID-19 symptoms data in the analysis improved model performance and variable predictive value across all tested models (p < 0.0001), with the 10-fold cross-validation AUC increasing to near or over 0.7 in all models when symptoms data were included. In various pairwise comparisons, the GBT method had the highest predictive ability (AUC = 0.796 Â± 0.017), significantly outperforming multivariate logistic regression and the other AI/ML approaches.\nConclusions\nConventional multivariate regression-based models are better than some and worse than other machine learning algorithms to provide good predictive accuracy in a moderate dataset with a reasonable number of features. However, whenever possible, the AI/ML GBT approach should be considered.",

Regression results show that gender, age, major, institution type, and institutional policy significantly influenced ChatGPT use for general, writing, and programming tasks. Students in their 30sâ40s were more likely to use ChatGPT frequently than younger students. Non-native English speakers were more likely than native speakers to use ChatGPT frequently for writing, suggesting its potential as a support tool for language learners. Institutional policies allowing ChatGPT use predicted higher use of ChatGPT. Thematic analysis and natural language processing of open-ended responses revealed varied attitudes towards ChatGPT, with some fearing institutional punishment for using ChatGPT and others confident in their appropriate use of ChatGPT. Computer science majors expressed concerns about job displacement due to the advent of generative AI. Higher-income students generally viewed ChatGPT more positively than their lower-income counterparts. Our research underscores how technology can both empower and marginalize within educational settings; we advocate for equitable integration of AI in academic environments for diverse students.",

Building upon the foundations of PoAh consensus, this enhanced iteration, known as PoAh 2.0, integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the block creator node level. This novel approach allows for the generation of block transactions embedded with AI-determined sensitivity and other applicable transaction-related metadata, a pioneering concept in this domain. The verifier node, a trusted entity, is tasked with verifying incoming blocks, utilizing the block header and its metadata information to determine authenticity while preserving the privacy of the content of the blockâs data. A core innovation of PoAh 2.0 is its dynamic authentication mechanism, which adapts to the sensitivity level of the data within each block, behaving in an adaptive way based on the situation. AI plays a crucial role in this process, ensuring the blockâs integrity and security are maintained. To demonstrate the efficacy of this advanced AI-enabled PoAh 2.0 consensus, we conducted a case study in an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based eHealth scenario. The results from this study reveal that our developed dynamic authentication technique not only significantly enhances the original PoAh version but also establishes a new benchmark in block validation and security for eHealth applications. The integration of AI and improved dynamic authentication, calibrated to the security needs of each block, marks a novel and significant stride in blockchain research. This development not only enriches the current understanding of blockchain applications in IoT, but also sets a new direction for future research in secure and efficient blockchain implementations in the IoMT-Edge centric eHealth landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe new generative AI (GenAI) paradigm offers unprecedented opportunities for users to tap into. AI capabilities are increasingly helpful in creative and knowledge-intensive domains that have long been considered a territory of human expertise. The new breed of chatbots is based on large language models (LLMs), and they have overcome many constraints that plague the everyday use of previous AI technologies. This article employs the theory of affordances to understand how ChatGPT facilitates (i.e., affords) and constrains (i.e., disaffords) the usefulness of a new breed of chatbots. We further divide two distinct yet interrelated dimensions of new AI affordances: creational and conversational. Via 29 interviews with professionals using ChatGPT in various creative and knowledge-intensive sectors, we identify three creational affordances (content creation and enhancement, knowledge acquisition and creativity augmentation, and task automation) and three conversational affordances (contextual sensitivity, interactive accessibility, and human-AI workflow synergy). Creational affordances refer to the systemâs ability to produce novel outputs and automate routine work, whereas conversational affordances encompass the variety of interaction possibilities with an AI system. Both affordances also involve disaffordances that limit the usefulness of the new types of AI systems. Furthermore, we introduce an integrated framework that shows how creational and conversational affordances reinforce each other via meta-affordances of accessibility, accumulation, and adaptability. We illustrate our findings with practical examples and offer guidelines for using these emerging capabilities in company settings.",

Currently, information on the gene and protein pathways contributing to bleaching responses is lacking, including the role of autoinducers. Although the autoinducer AI-1 is well understood, information on AI-2 is insufficient. Here, we observed a 3.7â4.0 times higher abundance of the AI-2 synthesis gene luxS in bleached individuals relative to their healthy counterparts among reef-building coral samples from the natural environment. Laboratory tests further revealed that AI-2 contributed significantly to an increase in coral bleaching, altered the ratio of potential probiotic and pathogenic bacteria, and suppressed the antiviral activity of specific pathogenic bacteria while enhancing their functional potential, such as energy metabolism, chemotaxis, biofilm formation and virulence release. Structural equation modeling indicated that AI-2 influences the microbial composition, network structure, and pathogenic features, which collectively contribute to the coral bleaching status. Collectively, our results offer novel potential strategies for coral conservation based on a signal manipulation approach.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (150KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Over the years, these programs have improved significantly. However, accuracy requires significant amounts of training on human-scored textsâreducing the expediency and usefulness of such programs for routine uses by teachers across the nation on non-standardized prompts. This study analyzes the output of multiple versions of ChatGPT scoring of secondary student essays from three extant corpora and compares it to quality human ratings. We find that the current iteration of ChatGPT scoring is not statistically significantly different from human scoring; substantial agreement with humans is achievable and may be sufficient for low-stakes, formative assessment purposes. However, as large language models evolve additional research will be needed to continue to assess their aptitude for this task as well as determine whether their proximity to human scoring can be improved through prompting or training.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancement of technology, emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) have also been growing rapidly and becoming more common than ever before. Kenya has taken tremendous steps in adopting the use of emerging technology in different sectors of the economy. In realization of the need to have a skilled digital workforce to develop solutions using these emerging technologies, Kenya has undertaken curriculum reforms and introduced the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) which has included digital literacy and coding in elementary school. Furthermore, computer science has been introduced in Junior Secondary School. In view of these changes, teachers should be adequately prepared with knowledge, skills, and attitudes to effectively teach these new technologies. However, in Kenya, AI was not and still is not part of the teacher training curriculum. Additionally, there are inadequate professional development opportunities in AI for both pre-service and in-service teachers since AI is not part of the CBC curriculum. That notwithstanding, it is inevitable for teachers in the current world to introduce AI to learners. Therefore, this study's objectives were to assess the confidence in AI, attitudes toward AI, AI ethics, subjective norms, perceived threats, and the readiness to teach AI among Kenyan K-12 in-service teachers and to assess how these factors influence their readiness to teach AI. To achieve these objectives, this study employed a quantitative research methodology by administering a survey using Google Forms to a random sample of 308 teachers from different grades from 37 out of 47 counties in Kenya. The findings showed that confidence in AI, AI ethics and subjective norms significantly influenced AI readiness while attitude towards AI and perceived threats did not significantly influence AI readiness. These results are significant in providing a basis for education policy change on AI education in Kenya, such as transforming the teacher training curriculum to include AI and designing AI professional development programs for in-service teachers to ensure they are well-equipped to teach AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become commonplace in solving routine everyday tasks. Because of the exponential growth in medical imaging data volume and complexity, the workload on radiologists is steadily increasing. AI has been shown to improve efficiency in medical image generation, processing, and interpretation, and various such AI models have been developed across research laboratories worldwide. However, very few of these, if any, find their way into routine clinical use, a discrepancy that reflects the divide between AI research and successful AI translation. The goal of this paper is to give an overview of the intersection of AI and medical imaging landscapes. We also want to inform the readers about the importance of using standards in their radiology workflow and the challenges associated with deploying AI models in the clinical workflow. The main focus of this paper is to examine the existing condition of radiology workflow and identify the challenges hindering the implementation of AI in hospital settings. This report reflects extensive weekly discussions and practical problem-solving expertise accumulated over multiple years by industry experts, imaging informatics professionals, research scientists, and clinicians. To gain a deeper understanding of the requirements for deploying AI models, we introduce a taxonomy of AI use cases, supplemented by real-world instances of AI model integration within hospitals. We will also explain how the need for AI integration in radiology can be addressed using the Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI). MONAI is an open-source consortium for providing reproducible deep learning solutions and integration tools for radiology practice in hospitals.",

Specifically, this convergent, mixed methods case study explores the impact of employing Generative AI (GenAI) tools and cyber-social teaching methods on the development of higher education studentsâ AI literacy. Three 8-week courses on advanced digital technologies for education in a graduate program in the College of Education at a mid-western US university served as the study sites. Data were based on 37 participantsâ experiences with two different types of GenAI toolsâa GenAI reviewer and GenAI image generator platforms. The application of the GenAI review tool relied on precision fine-tuning and transparency in AI-human interactions, while the AI image generation tools facilitated the participantsâ reflection on their learning experiences and AI's role in education. Studentsâ interaction with both tools was designed to foster their learning regarding GenAI's strengths and limitations, and their responsible application in educational contexts. The findings revealed that the participants appeared to feel more comfortable using GenAI tools after their course experiences. The results also point to the studentsâ enhanced ability to understand and critically assess the value of AI applications in education. This study contributes to existing work on AI in higher education by introducing a novel pedagogical approach for AI literacy development showcasing the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence.",

It shows how ChatGPT, a typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on âwhat is said about itâ and âwhat it saysâ. In contrast to the existing literature on ChatGPTâs potential influence on organizations, this article, through its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on examples taken from accounting, given the close link between the accounting profession and information technologies.",

Employing both simple linear regression and two-stage least squares (2SLS) to address endogeneity, we find that GAI financing significantly contributes to financial development, with stronger effects observed in Asian and non-European regions. Regional heterogeneity is evident, highlighting varying impacts across different subcontinents. Policy implications suggest promoting GAI ecosystems, attracting foreign investment, and enhancing publicity for GAI startups. The study highlights the need for future research on the ethical implications and dynamic effects of GAI financing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a modeling effort to explore the underlying physics of temperature evolution during additive friction stir deposition (AFSD) by a human-AI teaming approach. AFSD is an emerging solid-state additive manufacturing technology that deposits materials without melting. However, both process modeling and modeling of the AFSD tool are at an early stage. In this paper, a human-AI teaming approach is proposed to combine models based on first principles with AI. The resulting human-informed machine learning method, denoted as AFSD-Physics, can effectively learn the governing equations of temperature evolution at the tool and the build from in-process measurements. Experiments are designed and conducted to collect in-process measurements for the deposition of aluminum 7075 with a total of 30 layers. The acquired governing equations are physically interpretable models with low computational cost and high accuracy. Model predictions show good agreement with the measurements. Experimental validation with new process parameters demonstrates the modelâs generalizability and potential for use in tool temperature control and process optimization.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nFree and open-source lesion-segmentation tool (LST-AI), allowing widespread use and community contributions.\nâ¢\nTested on multiple external datasets and consistently outperforms existing models.\nâ¢\nEnsemble of 3D U-Nets and composite loss functions to optimize performance.\nâ¢\nEnhanced detection rate, especially for small lesions 10â100 mm3.\nâ¢\nIncludes lesion location annotation per 2017 McDonald criteria.\nAbstract\nAutomated segmentation of brain white matter lesions is crucial for both clinical assessment and scientific research in multiple sclerosis (MS). Over a decade ago, we introduced an engineered lesion segmentation tool, LST. While recent lesion segmentation approaches have leveraged artificial intelligence (AI), they often remain proprietary and difficult to adopt. As an open-source tool, we present LST-AI, an advanced deep learning-based extension of LST that consists of an ensemble of three 3D U-Nets.\nLST-AI explicitly addresses the imbalance between white matter (WM) lesions and non-lesioned WM. It employs a composite loss function incorporating binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss to improve segmentation of the highly heterogeneous MS lesions. We train the network ensemble on 491 MS pairs of T1-weighted and FLAIR images, collected in-house from a 3T MRI scanner, and expert neuroradiologists manually segmented the utilized lesion maps for training. LST-AI also includes a lesion location annotation tool, labeling lesions as periventricular, infratentorial, and juxtacortical according to the 2017 McDonald criteria, and, additionally, as subcortical. We conduct evaluations on 103 test cases consisting of publicly available data using the Anima segmentation validation tools and compare LST-AI with several publicly available lesion segmentation models.\nOur empirical analysis shows that LST-AI achieves superior performance compared to existing methods. Its Dice and F1 scores exceeded 0.62, outperforming LST, SAMSEG (Sequence Adaptive Multimodal SEGmentation), and the popular nnUNet framework, which all scored below 0.56. Notably, LST-AI demonstrated exceptional performance on the MSSEG-1 challenge dataset, an international WM lesion segmentation challenge, with a Dice score of 0.65 and an F1 score of 0.63âsurpassing all other competing models at the time of the challenge. With increasing lesion volume, the lesion detection rate rapidly increased with a detection rate of >75% for lesions with a volume between 10 mm3 and 100 mm3. Given its higher segmentation performance, we recommend that research groups currently using LST transition to LST-AI. To facilitate broad adoption, we are releasing LST-AI as an open-source model, available as a command-line tool, dockerized container, or Python script, enabling diverse applications across multiple platforms.",

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability of LLM-based AI agents in handling a wide range of server management tasks, and to identify the potential benefits and challenges of employing such agents in real-world scenarios. We present an empirical study where a GPT-based AI agent autonomously executes 150 unique tasks across 9 categories, ranging from file management to editing to program compilations. The agent operates in a Dockerized Linux sandbox, interpreting task descriptions and generating appropriate commands or scripts. Our findings reveal the agentâs proficiency in executing tasks autonomously and adapting to feedback, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in simplifying complex server management for users with varying technical expertise. This study contributes to the understanding of LLM applications in server management scenarios, and paves the foundation for future research in this domain.",

This study explores students' adoption and perceptions of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots in higher education. Based on survey data from a large sample (n = 5894) across Swedish universities, the study employs descriptive statistical methods to analyze usage, attitudes, and concerns, and inferential statistics to identify relations between attitudes and usage and background variables (gender, academic level, and field of study). The results reveal broad awareness and use of ChatGPT among students, but not of other AI chatbots. More than half of the students expressed positive attitudes towards the use of chatbots in education, but almost as many expressed concerns about future use. Statistically significant differences were found across all examined grouping variables, particularly between genders and fields of study. Female students and students from the humanities and medicine consistently expressed more negative attitudes and concerns about AI's role in learning and assessment, while males and technology and engineering students showed higher usage and optimism. These findings not only validate the continued relevance of student backgrounds as a determinant of technology adoption but also expose several challenges and considerations surrounding AI and chatbot usage in education. The study supports the development of local solutions to AI in education tailored to student attributes and needs, and it provides insights for developers, educators, and policymakers.",

Our study aims to integrate industrial information and data into a digital model based on artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate acoustic and vibration behavior during the production preparation phase. This model integrates real manufacturing conditions with generated vibrations and acoustic waves, creating a comprehensive simulation tool for acoustic and vibration behavior during the production preparation phase. By harnessing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Big Data, and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), our approach achieves a unified system that consolidates data from diverse sources, facilitating a seamless information flow within an Industry 4.0 framework. Small signal variations made it complex to model manufacturing operations using AI tools, as seen in recent studies. However, the proposed approach overcomes these challenges and has been successfully applied to a numerical lathe using sensors and advanced analytical tools, paving the way for a robust industrial information integration system to optimize and predict operational outcomes.",

This longitudinal study investigates the comparative perceptions of ChatGPT and human mental health support professionals across three dimensions: authenticity, professionalism, and practicality. Initially, 140 participants evaluated responses from both sources without knowing their origin, revealing that AI-generated responses were rated significantly higher across all dimensions. Six months later, the same cohort (n = 111) reassessed these messages with the source of each response disclosed, aiming to understand the impact of source transparency on perceptions and trust towards AI. The results indicate a shift in perception towards human responses, only in terms of authenticity (Cohen's d = 0.45) and reveal a significant correlation between trust in AI and its practicality rating (r = 0.25), but not with authenticity or professionalism. A comparative analysis between blind and informed evaluations revealed a significant shift in favour of human response ratings (Cohen's d = 0.42â0.57), while AI response ratings experienced minimal variation. These findings highlight the nuanced acceptance and role of AI in mental health support, emphasizing that the disclosure of the response source significantly shapes perceptions and trust in AI-generated assistance.",

The peak of the AI adoption curve for business will likely arrive in about 5 years.\nAbstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing every facet of the business landscape. Early adopter firms have implemented AI for various reasons, but the number one benefit realized is increased innovation (Jyoti & Riley, 2022). Early adopters of AI for new product development (NPD) not only demonstrate that AI finds many applications in NPD, but also offers substantial payoffs. This AI revolution is coming fast, estimated to have a 13â15 year window of adoption, peaking before the end of this decade.\nThis article focuses on AI applications in three target areas in the new product process, where the need for better solutions is high, and the applications for AI show significant benefits. They are: 1) idea generation and concept creation and testing; 2) building a robust business case leading to better âgo-to-developmentâ investment decisions; and 3) the design, engineering, development, and testing of the product. AI applications in each of these three target areas are described briefly, along with some in-depth case illustrations of AI at work in NPD, and the benefits achieved by leading firms. These benefits include a remarkable reduction in development and testing times; optimally designed products; better and more appealing new product ideas and concepts; and more effective and productive voice-of-customer studies.\nDespite the reported benefits of AI in NPD, the adoption rate is quite low, about 13% across firms globally (McKinsey, 2023); thus, AI for NPD was in the âearly adopterâ stage of the Rogers diffusion of innovation curve by early 2023. Impediments to adoption are outlined, based on numerous studies: the lack of a strong business case; high perceived costs of adoption; the lack of corporate readiness and the right mindset; and risks and ethical issues.\nHigh uncertainties remain regarding the adoption of AI in NPD, and many unknowns still exist; thus, numerous opportunities for academic research are identified in the form of research questions begging to be answered. The article ends with a call to action, aimed at both practitioners and academics: AI is the most significant innovation in our lifetime! It's time we all got on board.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence technologies are rapidly advancing. As part of this development, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used when humans interact with systems based on artificial intelligence (AI), posing both new opportunities and challenges. When interacting with LLM-based AI system in a goal-directed manner, prompt engineering has evolved as a skill of formulating precise and well-structured instructions to elicit desired responses or information from the LLM, optimizing the effectiveness of the interaction. However, research on the perspectives of non-experts using LLM-based AI systems through prompt engineering and on how AI literacy affects prompting behavior is lacking. This aspect is particularly important when considering the implications of LLMs in the context of higher education. In this present study, we address this issue, introduce a skill-based approach to prompt engineering, and explicitly consider the role of non-experts' AI literacy (students) in their prompt engineering skills. We also provide qualitative insights into studentsâ intuitive behaviors towards LLM-based AI systems. The results show that higher-quality prompt engineering skills predict the quality of LLM output, suggesting that prompt engineering is indeed a required skill for the goal-directed use of generative AI tools. In addition, the results show that certain aspects of AI literacy can play a role in higher quality prompt engineering and targeted adaptation of LLMs within education. We, therefore, argue for the integration of AI educational content into current curricula to enable a hybrid intelligent society in which students can effectively use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.",

However, users often only have a superficial understanding of how the Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrated into IVAs works, which leads to misunderstandings and potential risks of use. To promote self-determined interaction with IVAs, the development of specific AI-related skills, such as a comprehensive understanding of AI, is crucial. Based on learning psychology and media pedagogy principles, two online training modules were developed to deepen the understanding of AI concerning IVAs and enable self-determined interaction. A total of 99 participants took part in the training. The results show that the training promotes both understanding of AI and AI literacy. It also increases the intention to use IVAs, promotes a positive attitude, and enhances the willingness for self-determined interaction. In addition, the training contributes to a more realistic assessment of the IVAs' capabilities and reduces anthropomorphic perceptions. Overall, the study emphasizes the relevance of specific AI skills and shows how targeted training can contribute to improving these skills. Thus, the present work contributes to improving the availability of digital education programs.",

Manufacturers often face challenges due to a perceived shortage of valid data sets, highlighting the need for centralized platforms offering high-quality data. While global AI regulations are yet to be established, existing laws govern data collection, creation, labeling, and processing for AI training in various legal systems. The absence of explicit AI laws prompts a call for platforms supplying data to adhere to relevant regulations, especially in areas where AI controls devices interacting with humans, such as collision warning systems in yard tractors and robots. Compliance is crucial, given the complexity of rules governing data sets featuring people, animals, and buildings. The paper focuses on how to check the compliant data sets in Germanyâs legal context, focusing on situations in farm yards. People are often visible on such data sets; thus, the data set must preserve the right to informational self-determination and oneâs image, which is prevalent in many legal systems. Images portraying people typically qualify as personal data, requiring careful anonymization to address privacy concerns. The paper uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to remove images that contradict peopleâs rights on oneâs image; thus, data sets that comply with data protection laws can be created. It also addresses the lesser-explored issue of the right to oneâs image in German law. Though AI training may not be impeded, dissemination via digital platforms must adhere to legal boundaries, even if metadata is absent. The paper suggests an AI solution to identify images within legal limits, detect violations, and modify them to create a legally compliant data set respecting the right to oneâs image.",

An individual's attitude toward AI significantly influences its adoption. Despite this, no specific scale has been designed to measure this attitude, particularly in the Chinese context. To address this gap, our study aims to construct the AI-Assisted L2 Learning Attitude Scale for Chinese College Students (AL2AS-CCS) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with L2 proficiency. Our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. In Phase One (Sample 1: n = 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the AL2AS-CCS. The resulting two-factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. In Phase Two (Sample 2: n = 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. CFA in Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. Additionally, the AL2AS-CCS exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross-gender invariance. Our findings suggest that the AL2AS-CCS is a valid measurement tool for assessing Chinese college students' attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Moreover, Chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward AI-assisted L2 learning. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their L2 proficiency.",

Motility-based protein markers, proAKAP4, as one of the molecular markers that have recently been developed in the breeding industry, are expected to be applied and used at AI centers in Indonesia to optimize the use of superior Bali bulls, which are also supported by various semen and freezability characteristics. Using all Bali bulls from the Regional AI center in one of the provinces in Indonesia, this study divided the bulls into motility grade A and motility grade B groups. The collected semen is tested using various methods based on the literature, including fresh and frozen semen and sperm freezability. The proAKAP4 was quantified using the Bull 4MIDÂ® Kit with ELISA. The characteristics of fresh semen were significantly different (P < 0.05) except for sperm abnormalities (P > 0.05). The frozen semen characteristics were significantly different (P < 0.05) regarding plasma membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation, and several kinematic parameters. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the freezability characteristics of Bali bull sperm. ProAKAP4 was significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant in the motility grade B bull group and was closely correlated (P < 0.05) with progressive motility and sperm viability. Motility-based protein markers, proAKAP4, can be applied to bulls at the Regional AI Center, with quantification results showing that half of the bull population used in research does not meet the fitness standards for superior bulls.",

AI/ML have been used in healthcare to predict and prevent adverse events.\nâ¢\nPast studies have built medical AI/ML models, but few have been deployed in practice.\nâ¢\nMany features of the AI model for IDH prediction were known from the literature.\nâ¢\nWhat is learned as a result. The model using factors from past and current hemodialysis sessions excelled in predicting.\nâ¢\nThe AI dashboard for IDH risk prediction received high satisfaction for its usability.\nâ¢\nAI assistance significantly lowered the IDH occurrence rate, improving patient care.\nAbstract\nBackground\nIntradialytic hypotension (IDH) is one of the most common and critical complications of hemodialysis. Despite many proven factors associated with IDH, accurately predicting it before it occurs for individual patients during dialysis sessions remains a challenge.\nPurpose\nTo establish artificial intelligence (AI) predictive models for IDH, which consider risk factors from previous and ongoing dialysis to optimize model performance. We then implement a novel digital dashboard with the best model for continuous monitoring of patientsâ status undergoing hemodialysis. The AI dashboard can display the real-time probability of IDH for each patient in the hemodialysis center providing an objective reference for care members for monitoring IDH and treating it in advance.\nMethods\nEight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Multilayer Perception (MLP), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and NaiveBayes, were used to establish the predictive model of IDH to determine if the patient will acquire IDH within 60 min. In addition to real-time features, we incorporated several features sourced from previous dialysis sessions to improve the modelâs performance. The electronic medical records of patients who had undergone hemodialysis at Chi Mei Medical Center between September 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included in this research. Impact evaluation of AI assistance was conducted by IDH rate.\nResults\nThe results showed that the XGBoost model had the best performance (accuracy: 0.858, sensitivity: 0.858, specificity: 0.858, area under the curve: 0.936) and was chosen for AI dashboard implementation. The care members were delighted with the dashboard providing real-time scientific probabilities for IDH risk and historic predictive records in a graphic style. Other valuable functions were appended in the dashboard as well. Impact evaluation indicated a significant decrease in IDH rate after the application of AI assistance.\nConclusion\nThis AI dashboard provides high-quality results in IDH risk prediction during hemodialysis. High-risk patients for IDH will be recognized 60 min earlier, promoting individualized preventive interventions as part of the treatment plan. Our approach is believed to promise an excellent way for IDH management.",

We investigated several factors that play a role in teachersâ motivation and engagement to harness genAI in teaching and learning. We examined contextual factors (in-school support to apply genAI, time pressure, disruptive student behavior) as predictors of motivation (genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., genAI integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities) over the course of one school term. Among 368 Australian primary and secondary school teachers, our findings revealed that genAI support was associated with greater genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing. Time pressure was also linked with greater genAI valuing, whereas disruptive student behavior was not linked with the genAI motivation or engagement variables. In turn, genAI self-efficacy was linked with greater levels of both types of genAI integration. GenAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work only. Our results provide knowledge about factors relevant for supporting genAI and its application among teachers in Australiaâand also hold relevance to teachers in other countries.",

Among those nations, Canada is particularly noteworthy: Canada was the first nation to implement a national AI strategy, and more recently, Canada's federal and provincial governments have designed and implemented a wide range of initiatives that attempt to intervene in a variety of potential impacts associated with AI systems. We present a semi-systematic review and synthesis of 84 of those AI governance initiatives. We find that those 84 initiatives predominantly focus on developing programs, policies, and strategic plans to intervene in industry and innovation, technology production and use, AI research, and public administration. Conversely, we find relatively little focus on developing ethics statements or standards, as well as little focus on intervening in social and workforce development services, AI education and training, and digital infrastructure. We suggest three opportunities for researchers and four opportunities for practitioners that, if enacted, would strengthen the overall state of Canadian AI governance. Our study contributes a novel macro-scale synthesis of AI governance initiatives within a national context, as well as practical opportunities for intervening in national AI governance challenges related to evaluation of initiative outcomes, public trust and participation in initiatives, AI impact representation in initiatives, and national unification.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become a major challenge in the education sector in terms of the way that students use and manage them. This study examines the development, implementation, and evaluation of a teamwork framework by using academic integrity standards and formative feedback to minimise the use of generative AI tools in the Business Project Management (BPM) unit and promote students' learning skills through teamwork and self/peer evaluation. This teamwork assessment was designed to transform students into independent learners by improving their cultural awareness, self-confidence, teamwork, communication, leadership, as well as personal and interpersonal skills. The study's objectives are to determine whether a teamwork framework can help to maintain academic integrity and transform BPM students into independent learners and leaders in the era of generative AI, and to determine whether lecturers' formative feedback enhances students' skills in teamwork assessment. This research comprises an empirical study of 408 local and international BPM students from different cultural backgrounds. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data and achieve a broader perspective of the research topic. BPM students reported their satisfaction with this type of assessment since it helped them acquire skills such as intercultural effectiveness and teamwork. Following the implementation of the teamwork framework, the number of instances of academic misconduct and requests for extensions have decreased dramatically, while the assessment's average marks increased by 10 %. A set of recommendations is offered that will ensure the successful implementation of the proposed framework for teamwork assessment and self/peer evaluation. This study was limited to the Business Project Management unit, but in 2024, the same study will be conducted involving other postgraduate units at Curtin University with a future rollout in other universities to compare how students perceive teamwork assessment.",

The Tagus Headwaters River Basin (THRB) in Spain is a key hydrological hub, providing regulated flow for agricultural, urban, and energy sectors, and facilitating water transfer to the Segura River Basin, a key semi-arid region. Given the basin's near-total allocation of water resources, accurate streamflow simulations are essential to optimize the socio-economic distribution and ensure sustainable management across both interconnected basins. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+), support vector regression (SVR), feed forward neural network (FFNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models in simulating the rainfall-runoff process at four gauging stations within the THRB. An ensemble machine learning technique is then applied to assess improvements in streamflow estimation. Results revealed that AI-based models significantly surpassed the SWAT+ model in performance. Furthermore, the application of an ensemble technique enhanced the precision of rainfall-runoff modeling by 18 to 26% during the calibration period and 4.1 to 9.2% during the validation period, compared to individual AI-based models. Additionally, the SWAT+ model's precision improved by 44 to 74% and 40 to 55% for the respective periods. The use of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) methodology allowed the results of the ensemble with machine learning to be more interpretable by explaining how each model contributes to the prediction. This research offers significant contributions to hydrological modeling, highlighting the importance of ensemble techniques in elevating predictive accuracy for various river basins.",

Traditionally, assessing fracture toughness relies heavily on destructive testing methods, specifically using edge-notch disc bend specimens subjected to three-point bending tests. These established methods are not only expensive and time-consuming but also frequently limited by the availability of data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a data fusion source modeling approach. This approach integrates primary fracture toughness test data with secondary predictive data derived from the maximum tangential stress criterion and the local strain energy density criterion. By employing adaptive boosting and general regression neural network algorithms, the models developed in this research demonstrate a marked improvement in predictive performance compared to traditional primary source models. Additionally, a feature importance analysis using Shapley Additive exPlanations values reveals that the mode mixity parameter, specimen thickness, and radius are critical factors influencing fracture toughness. The study highlights that while mode mixity emerges as the most significant factor, a reduction in specimen thickness generally leads to decreased fracture toughness, whereas an increase in radius has a more complex, often negative, effect. The results of this study indicate that AI-powered models using data fusion can overcome limitations related to data scarcity, enabling more accurate predictions in fracture mechanics. Furthermore, this approach provides a pathway for utilizing AI in other engineering domains where data sets are limited.",

This work introduces a novel approach to cope with AI errors using weakly supervised error correctors that guarantee a specific level of error reduction. Our correctors have low computational cost and can be used to decide whether to abstain from making an unsafe classification. We provide new upper and lower bounds on the probability of errors in the corrected system. In contrast to existing works, these bounds are distribution agnostic, non-asymptotic, and can be efficiently computed just using the corrector training data. They also can be used in settings with concept drifts when the observed frequencies of separate classes vary. The correctors can easily be updated, removed, or replaced in response to changes in distributions within each class without retraining the underlying classifier. The application of the approach is illustrated with two relevant challenging tasks: (i) an image classification problem with scarce training data, and (ii) moderating responses of large language models without retraining or otherwise fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDetailed feedback on exercises helps learners become proficient but is time-consuming for educators and, thus, hardly scalable. This manuscript evaluates how well Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides automated feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics, and economic reasoning. Besides providing this technology through an easily accessible web application, this article evaluates the technologyâs performance by comparing the quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) from Generative AI models with human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions to marketing analytics exercises. The results show that automated feedback produced by Generative AI (GPT-4) provides almost unbiased evaluations while correlating highly with (r = 0.94) and deviating only 6 % from human evaluations. GPT-4 performs best among seven Generative AI models, albeit at the highest cost. Comparing the modelsâ performance with costs shows that GPT-4, Mistral Large, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.0 Pro dominate three other Generative AI models (Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Expert assessment of the qualitative feedback (i.e., the AIâs textual response) indicates that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners. A survey of marketing analytics learners shows that they highly recommend the app and its Generative AI feedback. An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticismâit does not require any subject- or exercise-specific training. Thus, it is immediately usable for new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nVulnerabilities in the source code are one of the main causes of potential threats in software-intensive systems. There are a large number of vulnerabilities published each day, and effective vulnerability detection is critical to identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities. AI has emerged as a promising solution to enhance vulnerability detection, offering the ability to analyse vast amounts of data and identify patterns indicative of potential threats. However, AI-based methods often face several challenges, specifically when dealing with large datasets and understanding the specific context of the problem. Large Language Model (LLM) is now widely considered to tackle more complex tasks and handle large datasets, which also exhibits limitations in terms of explaining the model outcome and existing works focus on providing overview of explainability and transparency. This research introduces a novel transparency obligation practice for vulnerability detection using BERT based LLMs. We address the black-box nature of LLMs by employing XAI techniques, unique combination of SHAP, LIME, heat map. We propose an architecture that combines the BERT model with transparency obligation practices, which ensures the assurance of transparency throughout the entire LLM life cycle. An experiment is performed with a large source code dataset to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The result shows higher accuracy of 91.8 % for the vulnerability detection and model explainability outcome is highly influenced by âvulnerableâ, âfunctionâ, \"mysql_tmpdir_list\", âstrmovâ tokens using both SHAP and LIME framework. Heatmap of attention weights, highlights the local token interactions that aid in understanding the model's decision points.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nAffiliation type, attributed to a paper, is a continuum between academia and industry.\nâ¢\nConditioned meme score measures idea spread given a type of affiliation.\nâ¢\nMost highly cited papers are those co-authored with mixed affiliations.\nâ¢\nIn general, the contagiousness of single memes does not depend on affiliation.\nâ¢\nMemes present in both affiliations spread more easily through Big Tech than Academia.\nAbstract\nThere exists a growing discourse around the domination of Big Tech on the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) research, yet our comprehension of this phenomenon remains cursory. This paper aims to broaden and deepen our understanding of Big Tech's reach and power within AI research. It highlights the dominance not merely in terms of sheer publication volume but rather in the propagation of new ideas or memes. Current studies often oversimplify the concept of influence to the share of affiliations in academic papers, typically sourced from limited databases such as arXiv or specific academic conferences.\nThe main goal of this paper is to unravel the specific nuances of such influence, determining which AI ideas are predominantly driven by Big Tech entities. By employing network and memetic analysis on AI-oriented paper abstracts and their citation network, we are able to grasp a deeper insight into this phenomenon. By utilizing two databases: OpenAlex and S2ORC, we are able to perform such analysis on a much bigger scale than previous attempts.\nOur findings suggest that while Big Tech-affiliated papers are disproportionately more cited in some areas, the most cited papers are those affiliated with both Big Tech and Academia. Focusing on the most contagious memes, their attribution to specific affiliation groups (Big Tech, Academia, mixed affiliation) seems equally distributed between those three groups. This suggests that the notion of Big Tech domination over AI research is oversimplified in the discourse.",

Our work covers hardware, software, and algorithmics. We have built two prototypes of smart camera trap on a maximum bill of materials of 100$. We have also built two datasets, made publicly available, comprising over 17 k images, many of them notably challenging even for humans. Leveraging our broad expertise on embedded systems, specialized software libraries and toolchains, and AI techniques such as transfer learning, explainable AI, and, most importantly, continual learning, we achieve more reliable inference on-site - specifically 10 % higher F1-score - than MegaDetector run off-site on a desktop computer.

Here, we introduce Network for Knowledge Organization (NEKO), a workflow that uses LLM Qwen to extract knowledge through scientific literature text mining. When user inputs a keyword of interest, NEKO can generate knowledge graphs to link bioinformation entities and produce comprehensive summaries from PubMed search. NEKO significantly enhance LLM ability and has immediate applications in daily academic tasks such as education of young scientists, literature review, paper writing, experiment planning/troubleshooting, and new ideas/hypothesis generation. We exemplified this workflow's applicability through several case studies on yeast fermentation and cyanobacterial biorefinery. NEKO's output is more informative, specific, and actionable than GPT-4's zero-shot Q&A. NEKO offers flexible, lightweight local deployment options. NEKO democratizes artificial intelligence (AI) tools, making scientific foundation model more accessible to researchers without excessive computational power.",

Traditional detection methods, such as ground patrols and satellite imagery, are often ineffective, expensive, and time-consuming. This paper introduces a novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based IoT system for chainsaw noise detection and prevention. The system uses low-cost IoT nodes with microphones and microcontrollers to detect chainsaw sounds via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. These nodes reduce power consumption, allowing the battery to last at least 8 years. Detected chainsaw sounds are transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway and forwarded to a cloud server. The cloud server processes the data and dispatches a drone equipped with a camera to the site. The drone streams live video to the cloud, where AI algorithms analyze the footage for human presence. If detected, the drone activates sound and light alarms to deter illegal logging. Experimental results show that IoT nodes can detect chainsaw sounds up to 100 m, with the CNN model achieving an accuracy of 99.37 % and a loss of 0.0185. Comparisons with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM demonstrated the superior performance of CNN. This UAV-IoT system offers a fast, reliable, scalable, and real-time solution for detecting and preventing illegal logging. Leveraging advanced AI and IoT technologies, this system enhances environmental monitoring and conservation efforts. It represents a significant step forward in the fight against illegal logging, providing a practical, effective, and sustainable solution.",

Fish epithelia are covered by a mucus layer, composed mainly by highly glycosylated mucins, which are the first point of contact between fish and pathogens. Quorum sensing (QS), a bacterial communication mechanism through secreted autoinducer signals that governs gene expression, influences bacterial growth and virulence. The main A. salmonicida autoinducers are mediated by the luxS and asaI genes, corresponding to inter- and intraspecies communication, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the mucins that pathogens encounter during colonization of the gill and skin on A. salmonicida QS. We found that expression of A. salmonicida asaI, but not luxS, was increased after culture at 20 Â°C compared to 10 Â°C. Rainbow trout gill and skin mucins up-regulated asaI expression 2-fold but down-regulated luxS 10-fold. The downregulation of luxS was reflected by a reduction in autoinducer-2 secretion. Mucins isolated from skin had a stronger inhibitory effect than mucins isolated from gills on both luxS expression and A1-2 secretion, consistent with a higher relative abundance of N-Acetylneuraminic acid on skin mucins than on gill mucins. Reduction of AI-2 production by mucins or luxS-deletion lead to a reduced A. salmonicida auto-aggregation. Furthermore, after colonization of the gill, luxS was down regulated whereas asaI expression was upregulated. Both in vivo and in vitro, the expression of luxS and asaI were thus differentially regulated, frequently in an inverse manner. The strong AI-2 inhibiting effect of the skin mucins is likely part of the mucin-based defense against pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Purpose\nTo evaluate the effect of lower field strength on quantitative apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) values, contrast of the T2-weighted MR images and the performance of an AI-based segmentation.\nMaterials and Methods\n25 screening clients (61.6 Â± 7.5 years) from a study on a 3 T scanner were included and underwent a second examination on a 0.55 T scanner. Axial T2 weighted and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) sequences were acquired. An AI-based segmentation was performed. Based on this, the segmentation, volumetry, ADC values and the ratio of central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ) in T2 weighting were compared by using correlations coefficient (Pearson), BlandâAltman plots and a non-inferior test with a paired t-test and a margin of Â± 20% (lower and upper boundary).\nResults\nVolumetric assessment (peripheral zone//central gland) showed no significant (p = 0.13//0.38) difference between 3 T (mean volume: 14.81 (12.53â17.09)//23.07 (15.06â31.08) mL) and 0.55 T (mean volume of 14.29 (12.03â16.54; p = 0.13)//22.77 (14.41â31.12) mL). The deviation of the 0.55 T ADC values from the 3 T values was â10.14% (â16.09% to â4.18%) for the PZ and â4.68% (â10.12â0.76%) for the CG. Therefore, all confidence intervals remained within a margin of + /- 20% and thus demonstrated significant non-inferiority.\nConclusion\nBiparametric prostate imaging is feasible at 0.55 T: ADC values vary within a common inter-scanner range compared to a 3 T and no difference can be observed regarding contrast ratio between peripheral zone and central gland in T2 weighted images, volumetry and AI-based segmentation compared to 3 T.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nWith increasing numbers of patients and novel drugs for distinct causes of systolic and diastolic heart failure, automated assessment of cardiac function is important. We aimed to provide a non-invasive method to predict diagnosis of patients undergoing cardiac MRI (cMRI) and to obtain left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).\nMethods\nFor this modelling study, patients who had undergone cardiac catheterisation at University Hospital Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) between July 15, 2004 and March 16, 2023, were identified, as were individual left ventricular pressure measurements. We used existing patient data from routine cardiac diagnostics. From this initial group, we extracted patients who had been diagnosed with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or amyloidosis, as well as control individuals with no structural phenotype. Data were pseudonymised and only processed within the university hospital's AI infrastructure. We used the data to build different models to predict either demographic (ie, AI-age and AI-sex), diagnostic (ie, AI-coronary artery disease and AI-cardiomyopathy [AI-CMP]), or functional parameters (ie, AI-LVEDP). We randomly divided our datasets via computer into training, validation, and test datasets. AI-CMP was not compared with other models, but was validated in a prospective setting. Benchmarking was also done.\nFindings\n66â936 patients who had undergone cardiac catheterisation at University Hospital Heidelberg were identified, with more than 183â772 individual left ventricular pressure measurements. We extracted 4390 patients from this initial group, of whom 1131 (25Â·8%) had been diagnosed with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, 1064 (24Â·2%) had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, 816 (18Â·6%) had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 202 (4Â·6%) had been diagnosed with amyloidosis, and 1177 (26Â·7%) were control individuals with no structural phenotype. The core cohort only included patients with cardiac catherisation and cMRI within 30 days, and emergency cases were excluded. AI-sex was able to predict patient sex with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0Â·78 (95% CI 0Â·77â0Â·78) and AI-age was able to predict patient age with a mean absolute error of 7Â·86 years (7Â·77â7Â·95), with a Pearson correlation of 0Â·57 (95% CI 0Â·56â0Â·57). The AUCs for the classification tasks ranged between 0Â·82 (95% CI 0Â·79â0Â·84) for ischaemic cardiomyopathy and 0Â·92 (0Â·91â0Â·94) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nInterpretation\nOur AI models could be easily integrated into clinical practice and provide added value to the information content of cMRI, allowing for disease classification and prediction of diastolic function.\nFunding\nInformatics for Life initiative of the Klaus-Tschira Foundation, German Center for Cardiovascular Research, eCardiology section of the German Cardiac Society, and AI Health Innovation Cluster Heidelberg.",

This research uncovers an interesting phenomenon, the first of its kind to be reported, of PCE quantization, where the PCE values increase in steps with the increase in feature values. Our findings have significant implications for the development of efficient organic solar cells, as they provide a better understanding of the factors that influence PCE, and highlight the feature value ranges for which more efficient PCE would be achieved. Our study demonstrates the power of XAI techniques in uncovering hidden patterns in scientific datasets and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in the field of materials science.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe explosion of AI across all facets of society has given rise to the need for AI education across domains and levels. AI literacy has become an important concept in the current technological landscape, emphasizing the need for individuals to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage with AI systems. This systematic review examined 47 articles published between 2019 and 2023, focusing on recent work to capture new insights and initiatives given the burgeoning of the literature on this topic. In the initial stage, we explored the dataset to identify the themes covered by the selected papers and the target population for AI literacy efforts. We identified that the articles broadly contributed to one of the following themes: a) conceptualizing AI literacy, b) prompting AI literacy efforts, and c) developing AI literacy assessment instruments. We also found that a range of populations, from pre-K students to adults in the workforce, were targeted. In the second stage, we conducted a thorough content analysis to synthesize six key constructs of AI literacy: Recognize, Know and Understand, Use and Apply, Evaluate, Create, and Navigate Ethically. We then applied this framework to categorize a range of empirical studies and identify the prevalence of each construct across the studies. We subsequently review assessment instruments developed for AI literacy and discuss them. The findings of this systematic review are relevant for formal education and workforce preparation and advancement, empowering individuals to leverage AI and drive innovation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe democratization of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT, has sparked the interest of business practitioners given their ability to fundamentally change the way we work. While AI tools are positioned to augment human capabilities, their effective implementation requires the skill to understand where, when and how to best utilize them efficiently. Furthermore, meaningful engagement with the content produced by generative AI (GenAI) necessitates the intricacy of appropriate prompt engineering to optimize the learning process. As the field of GenAI continues to advance, the art of developing impactful prompts has become a necessary skill for harnessing its full potential. This research develops an AI prompting protocol through a constructivist theory lens. Based on the principles of constructivism, where individuals assimilate new knowledge by bridging it with their existing understanding, this research suggests an active engagement process in the human-AI co-construction of knowledge through GenAI. The goal is to empower business managers and their teams to construct effective AI prompts and validate responses, thereby enhancing user interaction, optimizing workflows, and maximizing the potential outcomes of AI chatbots.",

As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, schools and educators have started to recognize the importance of AI education in K-12 schools. However, there have been a limited number of studies reporting on the implementation of AI education in classrooms. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the current state of AI education in K-12 schools, exploring topics, instructional approaches, and learning outcomes. Twenty-five peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2018 and 2023 were selected for this systematic review. The findings highlighted that various topics were covered in K-12 AI education, including fundamental AI concepts, different types of AI, AI applications, and ethical considerations related to AI. To facilitate meaningful learning experiences, educators frequently integrated hands-on activities and project-based learning. The findings supported the benefits of AI education in enhancing students' AI literacy, problem-solving skills, and ethical reflections on AI's societal impact. Furthermore, it fostered motivation, positive attitudes toward AI, and an interest in technology while inspiring career aspirations. It is recommended to develop tailored AI curricula, instructional strategies, and appropriate tools and resources that seamlessly integrate into various subjects within the standard school curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground:\nLack of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models in medicine is still the key blockage for the use of AI in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Although AI models are already performing excellently in systems medicine, their black-box nature entails that patient-specific decisions are incomprehensible for the physician. Explainable AI (XAI) algorithms aim to âexplainâ to a human domain expert, which input features influenced a specific recommendation. However, in the clinical domain, these explanations must lead to some degree of causal understanding by a clinician.\nResults:\nWe developed the CLARUS platform, aiming to promote human understanding of graph neural network (GNN) predictions. CLARUS enables the visualisation of patient-specific networks, as well as, relevance values for genes and interactions, computed by XAI methods, such as GNNExplainer. This enables domain experts to gain deeper insights into the network and more importantly, the expert can interactively alter the patient-specific network based on the acquired understanding and initiate re-prediction or retraining. This interactivity allows us to ask manual counterfactual questions and analyse the effects on the GNN prediction.\nConclusion:\nWe present the first interactive XAI platform prototype, CLARUS, that allows not only the evaluation of specific human counterfactual questions based on user-defined alterations of patient networks and a re-prediction of the clinical outcome but also a retraining of the entire GNN after changing the underlying graph structures. The platform is currently hosted by the GWDG on https://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/clarus/.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (256KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

These conventional approaches, while essential to dermatological practice, are prone to misdiagnoses and delays in treatment, particularly for conditions like skin cancer. To address these gaps, this paper presents the SkinHealth App, an innovative AI-driven solution that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of skin disease diagnosis. The app integrates a robust ensemble learning model, combining the strengths of EfficientNetB1 and EfficientNetB5 architectures. This ensemble model improves disease classification performance through advanced image processing techniques such as noise reduction and data augmentation. The key contributions of this work include the development of a scalable and secure server-side structure that ensures the safe handling of patient data and efficient processing of diagnostic queries. Experimental results on the HAM10000 dataset demonstrate the model's superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 93%, along with high precision and recall scores, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives. These outcomes clearly establish the app's potential to enhance dermatological diagnosis by providing timely and accurate disease identification. Ultimately, this work bridges the gap between traditional diagnostic methods and modern AI-driven technology, offering a transformative tool for improving patient care in dermatology.",

EnergyShare AI is a powerful peer-to-peer energy exchange system that operates on a P2P model that integrates advanced machine learning with distributed energy sharing. This paper presents EnergyShare AI, a technology that connects consumers and prosumers through solar arrays, energy storage systems (ESS), and electric vehicles (EVs). Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, Energy Share AI significantly improves energy management efficiency and substantially reduces costs. Our approach offers several advantages over traditional linear integer programming models, particularly in optimizing bidirectional energy transfer involving EVs and highlighting the critical role of ESS and photovoltaic (PV) systems in facilitating efficient P2P energy trading. Our research results show that successful P2P exchange can lead to significant cost savings and improved sustainability, thereby increasing the amount of energy transferred between different household profiles and stages of human development.",

The body of academic and practice-based literature is growing fast, showing how libraries are exploring their role in Information Literacy (IL) and AI, ethics and AI, and how they vigorously test and adopt various AI-powered tools for their services. Across these accounts, librarians express concern about their competence, skills and knowledge of the new technology and its implications for the research community. In this article, we present a holistic process model called the B-Wheel that addresses the phenomenon's complexity with approaches adopted from design thinking ideologies. We propose design approaches as an alternative strategy for academic libraries that want to avoid partial optimisation of AI skills and to ensure more generative competency building in their organisation. We drew inspiration for the B-Wheel model from the principles and pedagogy of the 20th-century Bauhaus art and design school in Germany. The article focuses on the model's features and its elements, constructed through workshops in Scandinavian research libraries. We also present experiences from the first use case in a University Library in Scandinavia. We propose that the main principles of the B-Wheel process model â a holistic design approach and learning by doing â are transferable across and beyond academic libraries.",

Then, we generate an interval-valued T-spherical fuzzy Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo)'B model to uncover the role of AI in the supply chain dynamics and structural change of the food sector. After that, we explore the role of AI in alleviating the factors in building resilience within the food supply chain through the generated decision model and expert interview.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCritical Heat Flux (CHF) plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliability and safety within boiling two-phase flow systems. Despite the development of numerous CHF prediction tools using conventional empirical correlations, machine learning, and deep learning methods, the complex mechanisms underlying CHF continue to challenge the development of a unified, accurate, and robust prediction model. The complexity is further exacerbated by varying experimental dataset developed over the decades of CHF research. In response to these challenges, the present study leverages state-of-the-art AI method, including ANN, CNN, Transformer model, and transfer learning techniques. The proposed AI-based CHF prediction model, particularly the Transformer model employing self-attention mechanisms, dynamically assigns importance to different parts of the input data. The approach significantly improves the model's capability for CHF prediction. The results indicate that the predictive performance of the Transformer-based AI model exceeds that of the Look-Up Table (LUT) method and a benchmark model from the OECD-NEA based on the database encompasses 24,579 CHF data point conducted in vertical, uniformly heated, water-cooled tubes from 59 distinct sources over the past 60 years. The five-input AI model achieved the best predictive performance: Mean P/M of 1.008, Std. P/M of 0.122, RMSPE of 12.3%, MAPE of 7.22%, NRMSE of 9.91%, and Q2 of 1.26%. Moreover, the AI-based CHF prediction model's prediction behaviors are examined and compared with the LUT method. This comparison confirms the model's resistance to overfitting. Finally, by utilizing transfer learning, the model's ability to predict CHF in tubes is extended to annulus and plate geometries. The CHF prediction results of transfer learning to annulus geometry are as follows: Mean P/M of 1.012, Std. P/M of 0.134, RMSPE of 13.4%, MAPE of 8.51%, NRMSE of 10.42%, and Q2 of 8.31%, showcasing the flexibility and robustness of AI-based CHF prediction model towards different flow channels.",

This research investigates the dynamic relationship between banking and finance artificial intelligence technology innovation and banks' financial performance across 20 countries using the feasible generalized least squares and the generalized method of moments techniques. The results show that banking and finance artificial intelligence technology innovation positively impacts banks' return on assets, highlighting its role in enhancing financial performance. The interaction term between artificial intelligence innovation and economic growth emphasizes their collaborative positive impact on financial performance. Mediation analysis highlights information and communication technology development's role in transforming artificial intelligence innovation into improved financial outcomes. Considering lagged effects, initial innovation surges correlate with improved financial performance, but prolonged exposure leads to diminishing returns. Moreover, the findings indicate that non-performing loans negatively affect financial performance, underscoring the importance of asset quality. Additionally, regulatory capital and economic growth are positively associated with financial performance, while government regulations exhibit a negative impact.

Detecting accurate protein structures is fundamental to understanding their functions. Advances in deep learning (DL), artificial intelligence, and similar technologies have transformed computational biology. AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold are examples of AI models greatly outperforming traditional methods to predict 3D protein structures with very high accuracy. This study builds on the progress, using an ensemble deep learning model for protein secondary structure prediction. When it came to training and validation, the ensemble model outscored the individual models with the best accuracy (94.41%) and the lowest validation loss (0.1585). Since it maintains the structural integrity of protein sequences, the ROUGE-L score, which is widely used in natural language processing (NLP), works well for protein sequence evaluation. This integrates NLP methods with bioinformatics. Model predictions were made more interpretable by utilizing explainable AI approaches like integrated gradients and LIME, which shed light on the characteristics that affect protein shape. By using this method, biases are lessened, and a greater comprehension of the biological connections between protein shapes and sequences is provided.",

Specifically, tech companies increasingly utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to meet their sustainability goals. However, little is known about how tech companies can leverage AI to accelerate sustainability by formulating and implementing appropriate strategies. To better understand the intertwined nature of AI and sustainability from a strategy perspective, this research conceptually develops a novel AI x Sustainability framework by drawing from the nested sustainability model and integrating insights from different literature streams. It then applies this framework to six leading Big Tech companies (i.e., Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, and SAP) by conducting a comprehensive document analysis of 69 documents describing 244 individual AI x Sustainability initiatives to reveal whether and how these companies appear to follow specific AI x Sustainability strategies. Lastly, an exploratory survey with potential tech companies' clients (N = 192) sheds light on how clients perceive tech companies' communicated strategic positioning based on the framework. The research provides new theoretical insights, serves as a blueprint for other tech companies, including implications for their AI x Sustainability positioning, and offers a variety of future research directions.",

However, unfair, inequitable, and biased data usage for AI deployments does exist and raises ethical and sustainability debates and concerns. AI deployment frameworks are majorly developed by standard societies/groups, technology organisations, analyst groups and federal/government agencies. The paper explores the central themes of AI ethics and sustainability frameworks in declarative standards and statements published by various institutions. The paper offers a thematic analysis of the literature on AI ethics-led sustainability frameworks using MAXQDA software and identifies common principles. We show that there are an established 28 AI ethics-led sustainability frameworks that agencies and groups have disseminated. As well, 6 practical AI ethics toolkits/products are evaluated to translate common AI ethics-led sustainability framework recommendations to deploy AI ethics-led sustainability toolkits programmatically. The research findings validate that beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, explainability, autonomy, privacy, and biasedness need severe attention and postulating algorithmic trust based on AI ethics-led sustainability frameworks. The paper contributes to the unique AI ethics-led sustainability body of knowledge to become a helpful resource for both praxis and researchers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe computational logics of large language models (LLMs) or generative AI â from the early models of CLIP and BERT to the explosion of text and image generation via ChatGPT and DALL-E â are increasingly penetrating the social and political world. Not merely in the direct sense that generative AI models are being deployed to govern difficult problems, whether decisions on the battlefield or responses to pandemic, but also because generative AI is shaping and delimiting the political parameters of what can be known and actioned in the world. Contra the promise of a generalizable âworld modelâ in computer science, the article addresses how and why generative AI gives rise to a model of the world, and with it a set of political logics and governing rationalities that have profound and enduring effects on how we live today. The article traces the genealogies of generative AI models, how they have come into being, and why some concepts and techniques that animate these models become durable forms of knowledge that actively shape the world, even long after a specific material commercial GPT model has moved on to a new iteration. Though generative AI retains significant traces of former scientific and computational regimes â in statistical practices, probabilistic knowledge, and so on â it is also dislocating epistemological arrangements and opening them to novel ways of perceiving, characterising, classifying, and knowing the world. Four defining aspects of the political logic of generative AI are elaborated: i) generativity as something more than the capacity to generate image or text outputs, so that a generative logic acts upon the world understood as estimates of âunderlying distributionsâ in data; ii) latency as a political logic of compression in which (by contrast with claims to reduction or distortion) the thing that is hidden, unknown or latent becomes surfaced and amenable to being governed; iii) broken and parallelized sequences as the ordering device of the political logic of generative AI, where attention frameworks radically change the possibilities for governing non-linear problems; iv) pre-training and fine-tuning as a computational logic of generative AI that simultaneously shapes a âzero shot politicsâ oriented towards unencountered data and new tasks. Across each of the four aspects, the article maps the emerging contemporary political logic of generative AI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCharacterizing the energy performance of building components and locating anomalies is necessary for effectively refurbishing existing buildings. It is often challenging because defects in building envelopes deteriorate without being visible. Passive infrared thermography (PIRT) is a powerful tool used in building inspection. However, thermal image interpretation requires significant domain knowledge and is prone to artifacts arising from a complex interplay of factors. As a result, PIRT-based inspections require skilled professionals, and are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise to automate building inspection, but its application remains challenging because common approaches rely on extensive labeling and supervised modeling. It is recognized that there is a need for a more applicable and flexible approach to leverage AI to assist PIRT in realistic building inspections. In this study, we present a label-free method for detecting anomalies during thermographic inspection of building envelopes. It is based on the AI-driven prediction of thermal distributions from color images. Effectively the method performs as a one-class classifier of the thermal image regions with a high mismatch between the predicted and actual thermal distributions. The algorithm can learn to identify certain features as normal or anomalous by selecting the target sample used for training. The proposed method has unsupervised modeling capabilities, greater applicability and flexibility, and can be widely implemented to assist human professionals in routine building inspections or combined with mobile platforms to automate the inspection of large areas.",

This scoping review examines how the scientific literature conceptualises AI literacy in relation to teachersâ different forms of professional knowledge relevant for Teacher Education (TE). The search strategy included papers and proceedings from 2000 to 2023 related to AI literacy and TE as well as the intersection of AI and teaching. Thirty-four papers were included in the analysis. The Aristotelian concepts episteme (theoretical-scientific knowledge), techne (practical-productive knowledge), and phronesis (professional judgement) were used as a lens to capture implicit and explicit dimensions of teachersâ professional knowledge. Results indicate that AI literacy is a globally emerging research topic in education but almost absent in the context of TE. The literature covers many different topics and draws on different methodological approaches. Computer science and exploratory teaching approaches influence the type of epistemic, practical, and ethical knowledge. Currently, teachersâ professional knowledge is not broadly addressed or captured in the research. Questions of ethics are predominantly addressed as a matter of understanding technical configurations of data-driven AI technologies. Teachersâ practical knowledge tends to translate into the adoption of digital resources for teaching about AI or the integration of AI EdTech into teaching. By identifying several research gaps, particularly concerning teachers' practical and ethical knowledge, this paper adds to a more comprehensive understanding of AI literacy in teaching and can contribute to a more well-informed AI literacy education in TE as well as laying the ground for future research related to teachersâ professional knowledge.",

Based on social cognitive theory, our study aims to validate the effectiveness of the strategy to improve users' intelligent service experience and service outcomes by evoking a high level of automated social presence through revealing the effects of both warmth perception and competence perception from multimodal AI anthropomorphic interactions on users' intelligent service evaluation. The conclusions show that: (1) Both warmth perception and competence perception can improve users' intelligent service evaluations; (2) At the beginning of car use, users are more likely to give positive evaluations for competence perception (safety), while the longer they use the car, the more likely they are to give positive evaluations for warmth perception (intimacy and friendliness); (3) Warmth perception can significantly enhance the positive impact of competence perception (safety and entertainment) on users' intelligent service evaluations. The findings of this study enrich the social cognition theory and the social presence theory, which have significant implications for the management of user experience in anthropomorphic AI interactions as well as the improvement of intelligent service quality.\nGraphical abstract\nBased on social cognitive theory, this study aims to validate the effectiveness of the strategy to improve users' intelligent service experience and service outcomes by evoking a high level of automated social presence through revealing the effects of both warmth perception and competence perception from multimodal AI anthropomorphic interactions on users' intelligent service evaluation.\nDownload: Download high-res image (250KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancement of AI technology, the successful AI adoption in organizations has become a top priority in modern society. However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.",

Through an analysis of 47 empirical studies, the review presents, synthesizes, and evaluates the educational theories underpinning the learning task design, the content, the pedagogies used for teaching, as well as the measurement and outcomes of the existing literature on AI education programs in K-12 settings. The principal findings reveal a diverse landscape of learning task design for teaching AI to K-12 students. Positive outcomes underscore the effectiveness of well-crafted hands-on tasks in fostering deep understanding and engagement.

Yet, few studies have consolidated key trends in adopting AI for HRM, especially on managerial competencies required for adopting AI-based technologies and identifying the key research directions for HR managers, including the development of an AI-focused competency framework for HR managers. A systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliometrics analysis were conducted to identify the current research direction for managers adopting AI in HRM. Several themes of managerial capabilities required for adopting AI in HRM were identified, utilizing the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV). The SLR identified applications of various AI tools and techniques in HR functions, recruitment and selection was one with the broadest use of AI applications. Managerial cognitive capability, managerial human capital, and managerial social capital of DCV were considered the initial coding categories under which various managerial competencies are required for the adoption of AI in HRM. This study utilized SLR, Bibliometric, and directed content analysis as three distinct but interrelated sets of methodologies for extracting novel insights into the adoption of AI for HRM. It highlights the associated managerial capabilities that need mapping for its adoption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent months, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had, and will continue to have, a dramatic impact on Higher Education (HE). A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universitiesâ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI. However, anything regarding AI and future developments will be extremely difficult to predict.",

Particular attention must be paid to ensure that users adopt this technological innovation when outcomes can be improved by its use. The aim of this study was to identify the aspects that need to be analysed and discussed to implement an AI denoising PET/CT algorithm in clinical practice, based on the representations of Nuclear Medicine Technologists (NMT) from Western-Switzerland, highlighting the barriers and facilitators associated.\nMethods\nTwo focus groups were organised in June and September 2023, involving ten voluntary participants recruited from all types of medical imaging departments, forming a diverse sample of NMT. The interview guide followed the first stage of the revised model of Ottawa of Research Use. A content analysis was performed following the three-stage approach described by Wanlin. Ethics cleared the study.\nResults\nClinical practice, workload, knowledge and resources were de 4 themes identified as necessary to be thought before implementing an AI denoising PET/CT algorithm by ten NMT participants (aged 31â60), not familiar with this AI tool. The main barriers to implement this algorithm included workflow challenges, resistance from professionals and lack of education; while the main facilitators were explanations and the availability of support to ask questions such as a âlocal championâ.\nConclusion\nTo implement a denoising algorithm in PET/CT, several aspects of clinical practice need to be thought to reduce the barriers to its implementation such as the procedures, the workload and the available resources. Participants emphasised also the importance of clear explanations, education, and support for successful implementation.\nImplications for practice\nTo facilitate the implementation of AI tools in clinical practice, it is important to identify the barriers and propose strategies that can mitigate it.",

Nevertheless, the successful implementation of artificial intelligence in educational contexts hinges upon various factors, one of which is the perspective of instructors. With this in mind, this study aimed to examine the perspectives of 536 instructors in STEM and non-STEM disciplines regarding AI integration. The respondentsâ thoughts, opinions, and concerns regarding advantages, disadvantages and challenges were gathered through an online questionnaire featuring both closed and open-ended questions. Additionally, a series of semi-structured interview sessions were conducted with a cohort of instructors to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The findings revealed that both STEM and non-STEM instructors expressed positive attitudes toward the integration of AI technologies into education. However, notable differences in responses and concerns were also identified in relation to the perceived capabilities and limitations of AI technologies within educational contexts. The results further elucidated a spectrum of opinions on the benefits (e.g., scalability and tirelessness), drawbacks (e.g., deepfake technology and comfort-seeking behavior), and potential challenges (e.g., educational disillusionment and espionage) associated with AI integration. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings for STEM and non-STEM education and offering recommendations for the effective and ethical integration of AI technologies in classrooms.",

Traditional methods of evaluating intelligent systems focus mainly on the performance of AI components, without providing comprehensive metrics for the system as a whole. Additionally, as these AI components are often sourced from third-party providers, users may face challenges due to inconsistent quality assurance and limitations in further developing AI models, and dealing with third-party service providersâ limitations. These limitations often involve quality assurance and a lack of capability for secondary development and training of services. To address these issues, we have developed a tool based on our previous work. It can autonomously build Intelligent systems from AI services while tackling the issues mentioned above. This tool not only creates service composition solutions that align with user-defined functional requirements and performance metrics but also executes these solutions to verify if the metrics meet user requirements. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool in constructing trustworthy intelligent systems through a series of case studies.",

This work proposes a variational quantum computing-based robust optimization (VQC-RO) framework for control and energy management in large-scale data centers to address the computational challenges and overcome limitations of conventional model-based and model-free strategies. The VQC-RO framework integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with classical optimization to enable efficient and uncertainty-aware control of energy systems in AI data centers. Quantum algorithms executed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are used for value function estimation trained with Q-learning, leading to the formulation of a robust optimization problem with uncertain coefficients. The quantum computing-based robust control strategy is designed to address uncertainties associated with weather conditions and renewable energy generation while optimizing energy consumption in AI data centers. This work also outlines the computational experiments conducted at various AI data center locations in the United States to analyze the reduction in power consumption and carbon emission levels associated with the proposed quantum computing-based robust control framework. This work contributes a novel approach to energy-efficient and sustainable data center operation, promising to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption in large-scale data centers handling AI workloads by 9.8 % and 12.5 %, respectively.",

These bacteria remain active but undetectable by standard culture-based methods without extensive enrichment, necessitating advanced detection methods. This study developed an AI-enabled hyperspectral microscope imaging (HMI) framework for rapid VBNC detection under low-level antimicrobials. The objectives were to: i) induce the VBNC state in Escherichia coli K-12 by exposure to selected antimicrobial stressors, ii) obtain HMI data capturing physiological changes in VBNC cells, and iii) automate the classification of normal and VBNC cells using deep learning image classification. The VBNC state was induced by low-level oxidative (0.01% hydrogen peroxide) and acidic (0.001% peracetic acid) stressors for 3 days, confirmed by live-dead staining and plate counting. HMI provided spatial and spectral data, extracted into pseudo-RGB images using three characteristic spectral wavelengths. An EfficientNetV2-based convolutional neural network architecture was trained on these pseudo-RGB images, achieving 97.1% accuracy of VBNC classification (n = 200), outperforming the model trained on RGB images at 83.3%. The results highlight the potential for rapid, automated VBNC detection using AI-enabled hyperspectral microscopy, contributing to timely intervention to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks.",

To understand how small and medium-sized firms have utilised Gen AI-based tools to cope with the market's high level of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and economic slowdown, researchers have conducted an empirical study. Although Gen AI is receiving more attention, there remains a dearth of empirical studies that investigate how it influences the entrepreneurial orientation of firms and their ability to cultivate entrepreneurial resilience amidst market turbulence. Most of the literature offers anecdotal evidence. To address this research gap, the authors have grounded their theoretical model and research hypotheses in the contingent view of dynamic capability. They tested the research hypotheses using cross-sectional data from a pre-tested survey instrument, which yielded 87 useable responses from small and medium enterprises in France. The authors used variance-based structural equation modelling with the commercial WarpPLS 7.0 software to test the theoretical model. The study's findings suggest that Gen AI and EO have a significant influence on building entrepreneurial resilience as higher-order and lower-order dynamic capabilities. However, market turbulence has a negative moderating effect on the path that joins entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial resilience. The results suggest that the assumption that high market turbulence will have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is not always true, and the linear assumption does not hold, which is consistent with some scholars' assumptions. The study's results offer significant contributions to the contingent view of dynamic capabilities and open new research avenues that require further investigation into the non-linear relationship of market turbulence.",

However, while there are examples of emerging organizations using AI as a key basis of competitive advantage as well as examples of established organizations trialing AI technologies, there are relatively few examples of established organizations fundamentally transforming their business models through the use of AI. Through case studies underpinned by interviews with named executives of ten organizations and complemented by an applicability check involving 14 executives, advisors and practice-oriented academics, this paper presents an empirically supported set of factors linked to successful AI-enabled business model transformation as well as a model of interactions between these factors. Using a horizontal contrasting approach to articulate the difference between empirical findings and a literature based model, this paper moves from the language of potentially passive top management support towards the concept of proactive leadership and introduces tech-sensitive innovation culture, AI-sensitive risk tolerance and strategic process discipline into the dynamic capability lexicon. The insights of this paper can be used by managers to assess their readiness to move beyond traditional âproof-pointsâ and successfully undertake and accelerate AI-enabled business model transformation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo investigate opinions and attitudes of medical professionals towards adopting AI-enabled healthcare technologies in their daily business, we used a mixed-methods approach. Study 1 employed a qualitative computational grounded theory approach analyzing 181 Reddit threads in the several subreddits of r/medicine. By utilizing an unsupervised machine learning clustering method, we identified three key themes: (1) consequences of AI, (2) physicianâAI relationship, and (3) a proposed way forward. In particular Reddit posts related to the first two themes indicated that the medical professionals' fear of being replaced by AI and skepticism toward AI played a major role in the argumentations. Moreover, the results suggest that this fear is driven by little or moderate knowledge about AI. Posts related to the third theme focused on factual discussions about how AI and medicine have to be designed to become broadly adopted in health care. Study 2 quantitatively examined the relationship between the fear of AI, knowledge about AI, and medical professionals' intention to use AI-enabled technologies in more detail. Results based on a sample of 223 medical professionals who participated in the online survey revealed that the intention to use AI technologies increases with increasing knowledge about AI and that this effect is moderated by the fear of being replaced by AI.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (255KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Our study contributes to competency-based education (CBE) by demonstrating how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can inform the definition of a CBC in the IEM field, thus initiating the pioneering steps towards a collaborative human-AI approach in CBC design. Through a stepwise methodology based on semantic analysis, text mining, natural language processing (NLP) models, informetrics approaches, and clustering algorithms, we provide data-driven insights to inform the curriculum development process. This approach enabled us to identify educational gap, particularly in domains such as digital twin engineering and human-centric IEM. Moreover, this study advocates for higher education institutions (HEIs) to embrace a more structured and collaborative approach to continuously developing competency-based curricula. In this perspective, AI (including generative AI) emerges as a valuable ally in curriculum design. This approach proves instrumental in crafting competitive and appealing curricula, especially at peripheral universities. This study culminates in an updated WING model showing how to build Industry 5.0 related curricula and a series of recommendations for engineering educators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe primary aim of this study is to explore the role of AI in urban design and its potential to reduce pollution in Chinese cities. The study investigates how AI-driven urban planning tools can be applied to create more sustainable, efficient, and functional urban environments. PM2.5 and PM10 show high concentrations with peaks between 2014 and 2017, indicating simple pollution actions. Post-2017, there is a noticeable decline in pollution levels, possibly due to improved regulations or the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific years, like 2016, show extreme spikes, possibly due to industrial activities or natural events. The overall trend suggests improved air quality and moderate to strong positive correlations exist between PM2.5 and PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO, indicating shared bases or co-occurrence. However, there is no significant correlation between PM2.5 and O3, suggesting different bases and behaviors. Bi-directional causality is observed between PM2.5 and PM10, PM2.5 and O3, PM2.5 and NO2, PM2.5 and SO2, and PM2.5 and CO. This mutual cause suggests interrelated impressive processes and shared bases. The results of the causality analysis suggest the existence of complex interactions, where high levels of pollution can predict changes in others. AI in urban design play vital role for identifying the most effective strategies for reducing pollution and helping to build more sustainable and functional urban environments in China.",

While acknowledging the capabilities of AI chatbots to handle customer interactions and improve response times, we critically examine several challenges they present, including interoperability challenges, data protection concerns, and biased output. This research presents a novel framework for managers to assess a firmâs readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology through the lens of the technology acceptance model (TAM), which has been adapted to account for the critical challenges associated with the emerging technology. Incorporating four factorsâsubjective norms, compatibility, facilitating conditions, and trustâallows for a more holistic assessment of a firmâs readiness to adopt AI chatbot technology. The framework, together with a readiness assessment tool, provides a comprehensive mechanism for managerial decision-making, focusing on the adoption of AI chatbots in customer service, sales, and marketing business functions. In exploring these factors, our article explores the managerial implications of integrating AI chatbots into business processes, ensuring an informed and holistic approach to technology adoption.",

In the wake of the ongoing digital transformation across various spheres of life, the incorporation of new digital technologies and the utilization of artificial intelligence hold the potential to contribute significantly to the attainment of these objectives. Leveraging the scalability inherent in digital business models, coupled with the widespread adoption of smartphones, facilitates the broad dissemination of digital healthcare services, even within emerging and developing nations. This inquiry adopts a quantitative research methodology to examine the implications of this phenomenon. In 2023, a cohort of 103 experts within German-speaking countries participated in an online survey, offering their insights into the impact of digitalization on health-related sustainability goals. The survey encompassed an assessment of the influence of digital technologies and AI on 13 sub-goals within the health domain, as well as on six additional SDGs. The comprehensive evaluation revealed that all 19 sub-goals exhibit a discernible medium to high impact. The analysis underscores that domains such as education and early warning systems are particularly amenable to digital interventions. Conversely, endeavors targeting the reduction of tobacco consumption or drug abuse may benefit from complementary measures. Conclusively, this study not only presents a developmental perspective on modeling but also formulates ten actionable recommendations, elucidating potential avenues for advancing the integration of digital technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance health-related sustainability goals.",

To this end, we analyze 21 9th grade students' contributions during a work practice week at a Finnish university, during which they were introduced to AI, sustainability, and business thinking and invited to generate business ideas for sustainable innovations that use AI. Our multimodal analysis examines studentsâ business ideation process and outputs to identify various elements present in the working process that contribute to the development of sustainable AI from a systemic perspective.

However, the empirical research on how AI assimilation may promote firm-level outcomes such as absorptive capacity (AC), customer agility (CA), and firm performance (FP) is still in its infancy. Drawing from the dynamic capability view and using 417 valid responses collected through cross-sectional methods from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Lebanon, this study examines the effect of AI assimilation on firm performance. The mediating roles of AC and CA were investigated. The moderating role of organizational agility (OA) was also explored. The findings support the hypothesized assumptions that continual advancement of technology evolves the industrial organizations' performance with CA and AC as parallel mediators, partially mediating the link between AI assimilation and FP and OA as a moderator, moderating the positive relationship between AI and CA and between AI and FP. The findings provide crucial insights for practitioners and advance the dynamic capability view framework. They provide compelling evidence that enriches the understanding of AI assimilation, demonstrating its positive impact on critical organizational outcomes and yielding performance benefits for SMEs.",

Automatic and early detection of these diseases could help growers to swiftly adopt mitigation strategies to limit the disease spread, leading to improved production. Deep learning-based CNN approaches have been widely applied to detect tomato diseases. However, deep learning models are highly computationally demanding, resulting in a computational bottleneck for practical adaptation for agricultural applications such as disease detection and monitoring. Over the last few years, developments of open-source Edge systems have provided opportunities for low-cost and low-power consumption practical solutions for deep learning applications for agriculture. Therefore, the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of standalone Edge-AI solutions for tomato leaf disease detection. To achieve this goal, firstly, this study employed lightweight deep learning networks to detect and differentiate tomato leaf diseases (bacterial spot, early blight, healthy, late blight, leaf mold, septoria leaf spot, two spotted spider mites, target spot, and yellow leaf curl virus). Then, these deep learning networks were deployed on low-cost and low-power consumption Edge devices to investigate their performance capabilities as standalone Edge-AI solutions for the early detection of tomato leaf diseases. Lightweight CNN based GoogleNet and MobileNetV2 deep learning networks achieved accuracies of up to 98.25 % compared to accuracies of 98.13 %, 98.13 %, 94.62 %, and 90.67 % of EfficientNetB0, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and NasNetMobile, respectively, in detecting tomato diseases. NVIDIA Jetson ORIN AGX and Nano significantly outperformed Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi with AI accelerator (Google Coral) in image classification, achieving classification times of 3.5 ms and 5.2 ms respectively, using SqueezeNet, compared to 15.3 ms and 10.5 ms on the Raspberry Pi devices. In addition, Raspberry Pi with Google Coral achieved the best cost/FPS performance of 0.14 compared to other Edge devices NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and NVIDIA Jetson Nano Orin with cost/FPS of 0.7 and 0.26, respectively. These results showed the potential of standalone Edge-AI solutions using low-cost and low-power consuming software and hardware resources for early tomato disease detections.",

The exponential increase of these applications has made governance frameworks necessary to uphold safe and effective clinical adoption. There is little information about how healthcare practitioners in MIRT in the UK use AI tools, their governance and associated challenges, opportunities and priorities for the future.\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional survey was open from November to December 2022 to MIRT professionals who had knowledge or made use of AI tools, as an attempt to map out current policy and practice and to identify future needs. The survey was electronically distributed to the participants. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and inferential statistics on the SPSS statistical software. Content analysis was employed for the open-ended questions.\nResults\nAmong the 245 responses, the following were emphasised as central to AI adoption: governance frameworks, practitioner training, leadership, and teamwork within the AI ecosystem. Prior training was strongly correlated with increased knowledge about AI tools and frameworks. However, knowledge of related frameworks remained low, with different professionals showing different affinity to certain frameworks related to their respective roles. Common challenges and opportunities of AI adoption were also highlighted, with recommendations for future practice.",

    "abstract": "The EUâs Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) imposes requirements for the privacy compliance of AI systems. AI systems must comply with privacy laws such as the GDPR when providing services. These laws provide users with the right to issue a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). Responding to such requests requires database administrators to identify information related to an individual accurately. However, manual compliance poses significant challenges and is error-prone. Database administrators need to write queries through time-consuming labor. The demand for large amounts of data by AI systems has driven the development of NoSQL databases. Due to the flexible schema of NoSQL databases, identifying personal information becomes even more challenging. This paper develops an automated tool to identify personal information that can help organizations respond to DSAR. Our tool employs a combination of various technologies, including schema extraction of NoSQL databases and relationship identification from query logs. We describe the algorithm used by our tool, detailing how it discovers and extracts implicit relationships from NoSQL databases and generates relationship graphs to help developers accurately identify personal data. We evaluate our tool on three datasets, covering different database designs, achieving an F1 score of 0.77 to 1. Experimental results demonstrate that our tool successfully identifies information relevant to the data subject. Our tool reduces manual effort and simplifies GDPR compliance, showing practical application value in enhancing the privacy performance of NOSQL databases and AI systems.",

This study explores AI detection tools' capacity to distinguish AI-generated from human-generated text in foot and ankle surgery literature. Six publicly available AI detection tools were employed, and 12 abstracts were analyzed, including 6 AI-generated and 6 human-generated. Copyleaks demonstrated the highest raw accuracy (83 %). Overall, the tools exhibited 63 % accuracy, with a 25 % false positive rate. GPTZero, retested after three months, showed increased sensitivity (24.5 %) in identifying AI-generated content. To assess countermeasures, AI-generated abstracts were reworded using ChatGPT 3.5. The rewording led to a 54.83 % decrease in AI content detection. These findings highlight the challenges in reliably detecting AI-generated content in scientific literature, emphasizing the need for robust countermeasures and continued vigilance against potential fraudulent research. The study sheds light on the evolving landscape of AI detection technologies and emphasizes the urgency of adapting journal policies to safeguard against emerging threats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe educational application of Generative AI (GAI) has garnered significant interest, sparking discussions about the pedagogical value of GAI-generated content. This study investigates the perceived effectiveness of concept explanations produced by GAI compared to those created by human teachers, focusing on programming concepts of sequence, selection, and iteration. The research also explores teachers' and students' ability to discern the source of these explanations. Participants included 11 teachers and 70 sixth-grade students who were presented with concept explanations created or generated by teachers and ChatGPT. They were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and identify their source. Results indicated that teachers found GAI-generated explanations more helpful for sequence and selection concepts, while preferring teacher-created explanations for iteration (Ï2(2, N = 11) = 10.062, p = .007, Ï = .595). In contrast, students showed varying abilities to distinguish between AI-generated and teacher-created explanations across concepts, with significant differences observed (Ï2(2, N = 70) = 22.127, p < .001, Ï = .399). Notably, students demonstrated difficulty in identifying the source of explanations for the iteration concept (Ï2(1, N = 70) = 8.45, p = .004, Ï = .348). Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed that teachers and students employed similar criteria for evaluating explanations but differed in their ability to discern the source. Teachers focused on pedagogical effectiveness, while students prioritized relatability and clarity. The findings highlight the importance of considering both teachers' and students' perspectives when integrating GAI into computer science education. The study proposes strategies for designing GAI-based explanations that cater to learners' needs and emphasizes the necessity of explicit AI literacy instruction. Limitations and future research directions are discussed, underlining the need for larger-scale studies and experimental designs that assess the impact of GAI on actual learning outcomes.",

Each individually conducted a brief strongly encouraged encounter and subsequently optionally participated in our study.\nResults\nWhen asked about the scenario's realism, positive answers were 50% (FNP), 16% (PA), 63% (BSN), and 87% (ABSN). Also, 41% FNP, 52% PA, 65% BSN, and 82% ABSN felt capable of creating diagnoses and treatment plans as thoroughly as they would with human patients. Regarding improving diagnostic abilities, favorable responses were 73% (FNP), 74% (PA), 72% (BSN), and 90% (ABSN). When asked whether they would recommend AI-VSP encounters to others, 91% (FNP), 84% (PA), 93% (BSN), and 90% (ABSN) agreed.\nConclusions\nAI-VSP scenarios were well accepted by students and demonstrated significant promise as a complementary simulation-based learning modality.",

This study examined the interacting role of individual traits with different levels of digitalization in participants' user preferences and trust within hypothetical medical scenarios. Specifically, preferences and trust levels towards various digitalized and analog formats, such as face-to-face interactions, video calls, written exchanges with a doctor or chatbot, or conversations with AI avatars were compared using standard scenarios of varying health risks and potentially embarrassing content.\nIn an online discrete choice experiment, 1009 participants rated hypothetical scenarios of varying medical concerns regarding their preferred conversation format and trust. User preference (n = 2018 observations) and trust (n = 9880 observations) were predicted using two multilevel models.\nHigher perceived efficiency of digital conversation formats predicted user preference for digitalized formats. However, usersâ preference for digitalized formats was generally lower compared to face-to-face interactions, especially when receiving bad news. The level of digitalization was negatively associated with trust, which was lower for consultations that involved receiving bad news or discussing potentially embarrassing content compared to good news. Trust ratings varied depending on the conversation topic.\nWhen comparing analog and digitalized medical consultation scenarios, digitalized medical consultations are not equally suited for every medical consultation. Participants preferred personal contact, particularly when bad news needed to be communicated. Additionally, trust in the doctor significantly varies depending on the topic of conversation.",

These models consider individual needs, turning patients from passive recipients to active participants. A key factor in this shift is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has the capacity to revolutionize healthcare delivery due to its ability to personalize it. With the rise of software in healthcare and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), a surge of digital data is being produced. This data, alongside improvements in AIâs explainability, is facilitating the spread of person-centric healthcare models, aiming at improving health management and patient experience.\nThis paper outlines a human-centered methodology for the development of an AI-as-a-service platform with the goal of broadening access to personalized healthcare. This approach places humans at its core, aiming to augment, not replace, human capabilities and integrate in current processes. The primary research question guiding this study is: âHow can Human-Centered AI principles be considered when designing an AI-as-a-service platform that democratizes access to personalized healthcare?â This informed both our research direction and investigation.\nOur approach involves a design fiction methodology, engaging clinicians from different domains to gather their perspectives on how AI can meet their needs by envisioning potential future scenarios and addressing possible ethical and social challenges. Additionally, we incorporate Meta-Design principles, investigating opportunities for users to modify the AI system based on their experiences. This promotes a platform that evolves with the user and considers many different perspectives.",

GMM-SYS estimates on a worldwide longitudinal dataset covering 4,184 firms that patented inventions involving AI technologies between 2000 and 2016 show a positive and significant impact of AI patent families on employment. The effect, presumably of product innovations, is small in magnitude and limited to service sectors and younger firms, which are at the forefront of the leaders of the AI revolution. We also detect some evidence of increasing returns, suggesting that innovative companies more focused on AI technologies are achieving larger impacts in terms of job creation.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThe AI tool mdprostate shows high accuracy in prostate cancer detection and grading using MRI.\nâ¢\nAllows to accurately rule out prostate cancer in low-risk lesions.\nâ¢\nDetects significant cancers with up to 85.5% sensitivity and 63.2 % specificity.\nâ¢\nMatches expert readersâ performance reported in PI-RADS v2.1 meta-analyses.\nâ¢\nMight standardize MRI readings, reduce variability and clinical workload.\nAbstract\nObjective\nThis study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a commercial, fully-automated, artificial intelligence (AI) driven software tool in identifying and grading prostate lesions in prostate MRI, using histopathological findings as the reference standard, while contextualizing its performance within the framework of PI-RADS v2.1 criteria.\nMaterial and methods\nThis retrospective study analyzed 123 patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies. MRI protocols adhered to international guidelines and included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, T1-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. The AI software tool mdprostate was integrated into the Picture Archiving and Communication System to automatically segment the prostate, calculate prostate volume, and classify lesions according to PI-RADS scores using biparametric T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. Histopathological analysis of biopsy cores served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated.\nResults\nmdprostate demonstrated 100 % sensitivity at a PI-RADS â¥ 2 cutoff, effectively ruling out both clinically significant and non-significant prostate cancers for lesions remaining below this threshold. For detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using a PI-RADS â¥ 4 cutoff, mdprostate achieved a sensitivity of 85.5 % and a specificity of 63.2 %. The AUC for detecting cancers of any grade was 0.803. The performance metrics of mdprostate were comparable to those reported in two meta-analyses of PI-RADS v2.1, with no significant differences in sensitivity and specificity (p > 0.05).\nConclusion\nThe evaluated AI tool demonstrated high diagnostic performance in identifying and grading prostate lesions, with results comparable to those reported in meta-analyses of expert readers using PI-RADS v2.1. Its ability to standardize evaluations and potentially reduce variability underscores its potential as a valuable adjunct in the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. The high accuracy of mdprostate, particularly in ruling out prostate cancers, highlights its clinical utility by reducing workload and enhancing patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Banff classification is useful for diagnosing renal transplant rejection. However, it has limitations due to subjectivity and varying concordance in physicians' assessments. Artificial intelligence (AI) can help standardize research, increase objectivity and accurately quantify morphological characteristics, improving reproducibility in clinical practice. This study aims to develop an AI-based solutions for diagnosing acute kidney transplant rejection by introducing automated evaluation of prognostic morphological patterns. The proposed approach aims to help accurately distinguish borderline changes from rejection. We trained a deep-learning model utilizing a fine-tuned Mask R-CNN architecture which achieved a mean Average Precision value of 0.74 for the segmentation of renal tissue structures. A strong positive nonlinear correlation was found between the measured infiltration areas and fibrosis, indicating the model's potential for assessing these parameters in kidney biopsies. The ROC analysis showed a high predictive ability for distinguishing between ci and i scores based on infiltration area and fibrosis area measurements. The AI model demonstrated high precision in predicting clinical scores which makes it a promising AI assisting tool for pathologists. The application of AI in nephropathology has a potential for advancements, including automated morphometric evaluation, 3D histological models and faster processing to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (286KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nStudy design: The model was trained on 120 annotated regions of interest (ROIs) of transplanted kidneys, containing manually annotated renal tissue structures such as glomeruli, tubules and arteries. We utilized the Mask R-CNN architecture known for its precise object selection in images. The Mask R-CNN model was pretrained on COCO and further trained through an original multi-task loss function, incorporating manually segmented ROIs. Following training, model generated multi-class segmentation masks for 110 histological slide images. These masks were used to calculate relative areas for the stromal component of the kidney and interstitial infiltration. Extracted metrics were then analyzed for correlations with fibrosis (ci) and interstitial infiltration (i) expert scores based on the Banff classification.",

Two online experiments were conducted with real and AI-generated food images stretching across the unprocessed, processed, and ultra-processed food continuum. Study 1 was designed to assess the accuracy with which people could identify AI-generated food images while Study 2 explored how the disclosure of an imageâs origin influenced the appeal of the depicted food. The participants in Study 1 found it very easy to recognize the AI-generated images, particularly in the case of ultra-processed foods. Notably, without disclosure, the AI-generated images were often preferred. At the same time, however, disclosing that a food image was genuine significantly boosted its appeal, whereas the revelation that it had been generated by AI mitigated this effect. These insights help to understand consumer psychology in the rapidly-evolving digital food marketing landscape, highlighting the nuanced effects of technological advancements in AI image-generation on human perception.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has repeatedly been shown to encode historical inequities in healthcare. We aimed to develop a framework to quantitatively assess the performance equity of health AI technologies and to illustrate its utility via a case study.\nMethods\nHere, we propose a methodology to assess whether health AI technologies prioritise performance for patient populations experiencing worse outcomes, that is complementary to existing fairness metrics. We developed the Health Equity Assessment of machine Learning performance (HEAL) framework designed to quantitatively assess the performance equity of health AI technologies via a four-step interdisciplinary process to understand and quantify domain-specific criteria, and the resulting HEAL metric. As an illustrative case study (analysis conducted between October 2022 and January 2023), we applied the HEAL framework to a dermatology AI model. A set of 5420 teledermatology cases (store-and-forward cases from patients of 20 years or older, submitted from primary care providers in the USA and skin cancer clinics in Australia), enriched for diversity in age, sex and race/ethnicity, was used to retrospectively evaluate the AI model's HEAL metric, defined as the likelihood that the AI model performs better for subpopulations with worse average health outcomes as compared to others. The likelihood that AI performance was anticorrelated to pre-existing health outcomes was estimated using bootstrap methods as the probability that the negated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (i.e., âRâ) was greater than zero. Positive values of R suggest that subpopulations with poorer health outcomes have better AI model performance. Thus, the HEAL metric, defined as p (R >0), measures how likely the AI technology is to prioritise performance for subpopulations with worse average health outcomes as compared to others (presented as a percentage below). Health outcomes were quantified as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) when grouping by sex and age, and years of life lost (YLLs) when grouping by race/ethnicity. AI performance was measured as top-3 agreement with the reference diagnosis from a panel of 3 dermatologists per case.\nFindings\nAcross all dermatologic conditions, the HEAL metric was 80.5% for prioritizing AI performance of racial/ethnic subpopulations based on YLLs, and 92.1% and 0.0% respectively for prioritizing AI performance of sex and age subpopulations based on DALYs. Certain dermatologic conditions were significantly associated with greater AI model performance compared to a reference category of less common conditions. For skin cancer conditions, the HEAL metric was 73.8% for prioritizing AI performance of age subpopulations based on DALYs.\nInterpretation\nAnalysis using the proposed HEAL framework showed that the dermatology AI model prioritised performance for race/ethnicity, sex (all conditions) and age (cancer conditions) subpopulations with respect to pre-existing health disparities. More work is needed to investigate ways of promoting equitable AI performance across age for non-cancer conditions and to better understand how AI models can contribute towards improving equity in health outcomes.\nFunding\nGoogle LLC.",

It produced top-quality assessments, ranking highly in 80 % of the cases across these classes.\nâ¢\nGTA accuracy in identifying AI-Generated Assessments: graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) accurately identified 50 % of AI-generated assessments. Notably, GTAs showed higher accuracy in detecting more complex, advanced AI-generated assessments compared to basic, introductory ones. This increased accuracy could be attributed to the more detailed responses referencing components outside what was expected of undergraduate students making the AI-generated responses in these areas more distinguishable.\nâ¢\nChatGPT's adaptability across subject Areas: ChatGPT demonstrated remarkable adaptability across various subjects, proficiently creating assessments for diverse disciplines including Technology, TESOL, introduction to Teaching, english Methods, and Mathematics. While it showed varying degrees of strength across these areas, ChatGPT consistently performed well, indicating its robust capability in handling a wide range of assessment types and academic subjects.\nâ¢\nPotential impact of class size on GTA Accuracy: within the finding there appears to be a correlation between class size and GTA accuracy in identifying AI-generated work, with higher accuracy of instructors being able to detect AI-generated work in smaller classes compared to a lower accuracy level in larger classes.\nâ¢\nImplications for AI in assessment Practices: the study underscores AI's potential in being used within higher education assessment. It suggests that AI-generated assessments can yield high-quality results. Further research is needed to explore factors like instructor characteristics, class size, and the effectiveness of AI detection tools such as turnitin.\nAbstract\nThis research study explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in undergraduate assessments, specifically focusing on the ability of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) to identify AI-generated assessments and the performance of ChatGPT, an AI model, in producing high-quality work. The study examines four guiding research questions and hypotheses related to the accuracy of GTA identification, the achievement of AI-generated work compared to student marks, the impact of GTA characteristics on identification accuracy, and the variation in identification and assessment across different subject areas. The study incorporates ten AI-generated assessments across seven classes taught by five GTAs. The findings reveal that ChatGPT consistently excelled the average student in all classes receiving 10 scores of A or higher out of 11 and receiving the top mark in 8 of the ten classes. GTAs accurately identified 50 % of the AI-generated assessments, with results suggesting a potential connection between class size and GTA accuracy in identifying AI-generated work. GTAs with prior experience and familiarity with ChatGPT demonstrated higher accuracy in identifying AI-generated assessments. However, further research is needed to explore this comprehensively. This study also reviews the effectiveness of TurnItin's new AI detector, highlighting an accuracy of 92 % across the ten assessments. The study highlights the adaptability of ChatGPT across different subject areas and assessment types, producing assessments that align with diverse educational contexts.\nIn conclusion, this research study contributes to understanding the effectiveness and adaptability of AI in undergraduate assessments. It underscores the need to further explore and develop AI technologies in education.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is considered as an important non-invasive way for tumor ablation in deep organs. However, accurate real-time monitoring of the temperature field within HIFU focal area remains a challenge. Although ultrasound technology, compared with other approaches, is a good choice for noninvasive and real-time monitoring on the temperature distribution, traditional ultrasonic thermometry mainly relies on the backscattered signal, which is difficult for high temperature (>50 Â°C) measurement. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) shows significant potential for biomedical applications, we propose an AI-powered ultrasonic thermometry using an end-to-end deep neural network termed Breath-guided Multimodal Teacher-Student (BMTS), which possesses the capability to elucidate the interaction between HIFU and complex heterogeneous biological media. It has been demonstrated experimentally that two-dimension temperature distribution within HIFU focal area in deep organ can be accurately reconstructed with an average error and a frame speed of 0.8 Â°C and 0.37 s, respectively. Most importantly, the maximum measurable temperature for ultrasonic technology has been successfully expanded to a record value of 67 Â°C. This breakthrough indicates that the development of AI-powered ultrasonic thermometry is beneficial for precise HIFU therapy planning in the future.",

Considering the black-box nature of DNNs, it is unclear how attention mechanisms affect model decision-making processes. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the internal relationship between the focused area of attention mechanisms and the prediction results. For the first time, an explainable framework for the attention mechanism of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image analytics is proposed, integrating DNN and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which realizes the effective explanation for attention mechanisms across different locations. The framework consists of three parts: the water extraction network which contains the attention mechanism at different locations; the proposed Attention- Gradient Class Activation Mapping (A-GCAM) method for attribution analysis of attention mechanisms; and we invent Category-specific channel Score of Confidence Mapping (CSCM) to perform geo-visualization for the output features of attention mechanisms. Experiments are conducted with the widely used Sentinel-1 system for water detection, in which three attention mechanisms with different characteristics are added to the encoder and decoder in DNNs. The results show that the framework can make the decision-making process of attention mechanisms transparent, thus improving their comprehensiveness and trustworthiness in various tasks and providing a reliable approach to selecting suitable attention mechanisms for the given task.",

To tackle data heterogeneity and labeling limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) framework system that evaluates embryo images and videos during the assessment of the IVF cycle. This research highlights the potential of AI models to serve as non-invasive, efficient, and cost-effective tools for the advancement of reproductive medicine in general, but specifically for embryo-selection tasks during IVF.\nSummary\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) has revolutionized infertility treatment, benefiting millions of couples worldwide. However, current clinical practices for embryo selection rely heavily on visual inspection of morphology, which is highly variable and experience dependent. Here, we propose a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) system that can interpret embryo-developmental knowledge encoded in vast unlabeled multi-modal datasets and provide personalized embryo selection. This AI platform consists of a transformer-based network backbone named IVFormer and a self-supervised learning framework, VTCLR (visual-temporal contrastive learning of representations), for training multi-modal embryo representations pre-trained on large and unlabeled data. When evaluated on clinical scenarios covering the entire IVF cycle, our pre-trained AI model demonstrates accurate and reliable performance on euploidy ranking and live-birth occurrence prediction.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEu-LISA is launching the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), which seems an example of a different, human rights-oriented approach to AI within the law enforcement. However, the reality is quite different: the usual problems of the use of AIâlack of transparency, bias, opacity, just to name a fewâare still on board. This paper critically assesses these promises of ETIAS and argues that it has serious issues that have not been properly dealt with. So as to argue the need to address these issues, the paper addresses ETIAS within the wider context of human rights and solidarity-based data governance. In this respect, ETIAS is seen as a tool which uses data for high value purposes, such as EU safety and security, yet it also calls for serious risk mitigation measures. Indeed, the risks related to law enforcement on the borders and in migration management are extremely serious due to the vulnerability of people who escape from poverty, wars, regimes, and other disasters. In the third part of this article, we articulate three proposals of such risk mitigation measures. We argue in favour of strengthening critical general safeguards in ETIAS, then elaborate a principle that should guide AI-based public service development (P4P principle) and end with a few IPR-related requirements for private sector involvement in such services. Adopting these measures could contribute to reduce the risk of building EU AI expertise upon data coming from the most vulnerable social groups of our planet.",

The present study aims to provide an overview of the developing tendency, cooperation, and influence of academic groups and individuals, hotspots, and crucial problems in the field of AI-aided drug discovery using bibliometric methods.\nMethods\nPublications on AI-aided drug discovery published from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2023, were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection. The document type was limited to articles or reviews, and the language was set to English. Citespace was used to conduct the bibliometric analysis.\nResults\nA total of 9700 publications were included, and the number of them generally increased over time, with a rapid increase tendency since 2018. The US and China were the leading countries in this field. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most influential institution. Ekins, Sean was the most productive author and Hou, Tingjun formed the largest cooperation network. Networks and clusters of keywords highlighted terms like âvirtual screeningâ, âexpressionâ and âdrug deliveryâ as focused topics, and burst analysis showed that âsupport vector machinesâ, and âclassificationâ received the longest attention. Meanwhile the keywords âsars cov 2â, âmolecular designâ and âclinical trialsâ were hotspots in recent years. The content analysis of the co-cited literature identified the significant questions to be tackled in future research.\nConclusions\nThis study offers a comprehensive landscape of the global contributions given to this increasingly important and prolific field of research and points out several areas that might be addressed by future research to better develop the field of AI-aided drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCollaborative writing, paired with AI feedback, represents an innovative and effective pedagogical approach with the potential to revolutionize language learning practices. This study explores the influence of a three-step collaborative writing intervention, where AI feedback specially enhances the revision and editing stages of the L2 writing process for Thai-major undergraduate exchange students. Employing a quasi-experimental design, the study included 39 junior exchange students, with 18 in the experimental group and 21 in the control group. The approach employed a wiki-based collaborative writing strategy, integrating ChatGPT for written corrective feedback. The 10-week intervention encompassed three writing tasks, involving collaborative outlining, individual writing with AI feedback, and collaborative writing. Statistical analyses, comprising the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Friedman test, revealed substantial improvements in posttest scores for the experimental group in comparison to the control group. These findings underscore the positive impact of a collaborative writing intervention improved by AI feedback on specific aspects of writing. This study contributes valuable insights into advancing L2 writing proficiency through structured collaborative activities and targeted AI feedback, providing valuable implications for both research and pedagogical practices.",

MRI plays a crucial role in diagnosing as well as in disease and treatment monitoring. Therefore, evaluation of cerebral MRI of MS patients is part of daily clinical routine. A growing number of companies offer commercial software to support the reporting with automated lesion detection. Aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of such a software with AI supported lesion detection to the radiologic reporting.\nMethod\nFour radiologist each counted MS-lesions in MRI examinations of 50 patients separated by the locations periventricular, cortical/juxtacortical, infrantentorial and unspecific white matter. After at least six weeks they repeated the evaluation, this time using the AI based software mdbrain for lesion detection. In both settings the required time was documented. Further the radiologists evaluated follow-up MRI of 50 MS-patients concerning new and enlarging lesions in the same manner.\nResults\nTo determine the lesion-load the average reporting time decreased from 286.85 sec to 196.34 sec (p > 0.001). For the evaluation of the follow-up images the reporting time dropped from 196.17 sec to 120.87 sec (p < 0.001). The interrater reliabilities showed no significant differences for the determination of lesion-load (0.83 without vs. 0.8 with software support) and for the detection of new/enlarged lesions (0.92 without vs. 0.82 with software support).\nConclusion\nFor the evaluation of MR images of MS patients, an AI-based support for image-interpretation can significantly decreases reporting times.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, and newborns of diabetic mothers, have increased risks of contracting microbial infections such as SARS-CoV-2, amplifying comorbidity and mortality risks. Hyperglycemia and its associated hyperinflammation mediate these risks but by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that hyperglycemia results in glycation (non-enzymatic addition of sugars to free amino groups such as lysines) of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory proteins and peptides that mediate innate and adaptive immunity. While glycation of hemoglobin A1c is used as a benchmark for glycemic control, studies of the effects of the glycation of immune system molecules are almost non-existent. Three AI protein-glycation prediction models demonstrate that immune system proteins and peptides such as serotransferrin, lactotransferrin, lysozyme, complement proteins, immunoglobulins, Toll-like receptors, etc., probably glycate at multiple sites affecting function. However, the AI-predicted glycation sites differed significantly among the three models employed. Therefore, three tests of these predictions were carried out. Predicted glycation sites were first evaluated in terms of clinically or experimentally identified glycation sites of homologous proteins and known effects of lysine substitutions at predicted glycation sites. Second, mass spectrometry was used to identify glycation sites on lactoferrin and human lysozyme. Third, the effects on the antimicrobial activity of lactotransferrin and lysozyme glycation were tested using a Candida albicans assay. Results of tests demonstrate that protein glycation occurs and interferes with immune function but that AI glycation prediction models are very inaccurate. Suggestions for improving AI accuracy are provided.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (212KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

We recently reported that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cardiac chambers volumetry in CAC scans (AI-CACâ¢) predicted incident atrial fibrillation in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In this study, we investigated the performance of AI-CAC cardiac chambers for prediction of incident heart failure (HF).\nMethods\nWe applied AI-CAC to 5750 CAC scans of asymptomatic individuals (52% female, White 40%, Black 26%, Hispanic 22% Chinese 12%) free of known cardiovascular disease at the MESA baseline examination (2000â2002). We used the 15-year outcomes data and compared the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of AI-CAC volumetry versus NT-proBNP, Agatston score, and 9 known clinical risk factors (age, gender, diabetes, current smoking, hypertension medication, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL for predicting incident HF over 15 years.\nResults\nOver 15 years of follow-up, 256 HF events accrued. The time-dependent AUC [95% CI] at 15 years for predicting HF with AI-CAC all chambers volumetry (0.86 [0.82,0.91]) was significantly higher than NT-proBNP (0.74 [0.69, 0.77]) and Agatston score (0.71 [0.68, 0.78]) (p < 0.0001), and comparable to clinical risk factors (0.85, p = 0.4141). Category-free Net Reclassification Index (NRI) [95% CI] adding AI-CAC LV significantly improved on clinical risk factors (0.32 [0.16,0.41]), NT-proBNP (0.46 [0.33,0.58]), and Agatston score (0.71 [0.57,0.81]) for HF prediction at 15 years (p < 0.0001).\nConclusion\nAI-CAC volumetry significantly outperformed NT-proBNP and the Agatston CAC score, and significantly improved the AUC and category-free NRI of clinical risk factors for incident HF prediction.",

Very little evidence in academic literature is present regarding the factors affecting the usage of GAI in Digital Marketing (DM). This study addresses this gap by exploring the key drivers and barriers associated with using GAI in DM. Leveraging Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), the research validates prior findings and introduces a conceptual model outlining factors that shape attitudes toward adopting GAI in DM to enhance customer experiences.\nA qualitative inductive approach was undertaken by conducting expert interviews to investigate the âreasons forâ and âreasons againstâ using GAI in DM and its impact on customer experience. The transcripts generated were manually coded and a deductive thematic analysis was done using the BRT as the theoretical framework.\nThe findings indicate four significant themes for adopting GAI in digital marketing viz: innovation, creative communication and content creation, speed, efficiency and timesaving, enhanced customization and personalization; predictive analytics and simulation. It also indicates five significant themes related to the key barriers were also identified viz: ethics and infringement of Intellectual Property; security and deepfake; learning ecosystem for the adoption of new technology; quality of data; reduced manpower requirement. The study further highlights how GAI influences customer experience in DM.\nThis study contributes to the field by (a) proposing a conceptual framework for applying GAI in DM to improve customer experiences, (b) examining the drivers and challenges of GAI adoption in DM, and (c) presenting a research agenda to guide future studies.

Major optical developments have improved pathological diagnostics lately.\nHigh quality microscopic optical scanners now allow whole-slide imaging of tissue sections and with the accessibility of datasets, digital imaging becomes attractive for biopsy analysis. Beyond its user-friendly features for image review and telepathology, digital imaging also enables the utilization of image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) which are advantageous for numerous applications. Nevertheless, AI faces significant barriers to widespread adoption. In order to extend the use of AI for clinical use in pathology, here we present an advanced approach for analyzing Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained biopsies and identify cancer cells. Our approach relies on the fusion of rapid spectral imaging measurements of biopsies with tailored machine learning algorithms designed explicitly for spectral images.\nThe spectrum measured at each pixel provides much more information than standard color, that contains only three values of red, green, and blue intensities. We lately found that the spectral information provides high separability of normal and cancerous cells in Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained biopsies. This breakthrough surpasses previous obstacles, marking the potential for utilizing spectral imaging for cancer identification. Nevertheless, the method required identifying the nuclei in the tissue, a complex task that has not yet been addressed.\nHere, we demonstrate a rapid spectral imaging system combining artificial intelligence procedures for spectral-based nuclear segmentation using U-net models, with an adjusted input layer for the spectral imaging size. We trained two models; one with the full measured spectrum, and one based on color produced from the spectra. Excellent segmentation performance is achieved with both models, but the model trained on the full spectrum achieved significantly better results. The high performance of spectral image-based segmentation together with the simplicity of the system makes it applicable for tissue analysis and cancer classification in the clinical arena.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe ever-increasing adoption of AI technologies in the hiring landscape to enhance human resources efficiency raises questions about algorithmic decision-making's implications in employment, especially for job applicants, including those at higher risk of social discrimination. Among other concepts, such as transparency and accountability, fairness has become crucial in AI recruitment debates due to the potential reproduction of bias and discrimination that can disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups. However, the ideals and ambitions of fairness may signify different meanings to various stakeholders. Conceptualizing fairness is critical because it may provide a clear benchmark for evaluating and mitigating biases, ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate existing imbalances and promote, in this case, equitable opportunities for all candidates in the job market. To this end, in this article, we conduct a scoping literature review on fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes, with special emphasis on its definition, categorization, and practical implementation. We start by explaining how AI applications have been increasingly used in the hiring process, especially to increase the efficiency of the HR team. We then move to the limitations of this technological innovation, which is known to be at high risk of privacy violations and social discrimination. Against this backdrop, we focus on defining and operationalizing fairness in AI applications for recruitment and selection purposes through cross-disciplinary lenses. Although the applicable legal frameworks and some research currently address the issue piecemeal, we observe and welcome the emergence of some cross-disciplinary efforts aimed at tackling this multifaceted challenge. We conclude the article with some brief recommendations to guide and shape future research and action on the fairness of AI applications in the hiring process for the better.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, significant strides in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to various practical applications, primarily centered around training and deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). These applications, however, require considerable computational resources, predominantly reliant on modern Graphics-Processing Units (GPUs). Yet, the quest for larger and faster DNNs has spurred the creation of specialized AI chips and efficient Machine-Learning (ML) software tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch have been developed for striking a balance between usability and performance. Simultaneously, the field of computational neuroscience shares a similar quest for increased computational power to simulate more extensive and detailed brain models, while also keeping usability high. Although GPUs have also entered this field, programming complexity remains high, resulting in cumbersome simulations. Inspired by AI progress, we introduce a workflow for easily accelerating brain simulations using TensorFlow and evaluate the performance of various, cutting-edge AI chips â including the Graphcore Intelligence-Processing Unit (IPU), GroqChip, Nvidia GPU with Tensor Cores, and Google Tensor-Processing Unit (TPU) â when simulating a biologically detailed as well as simpler brain models. Our model simulations explore the architectural tradeoffs of a modern-day CPU and these four AI platforms by varying computational density, memory requirements and floating-point numerical accuracy. Results show that the GroqChip achieves the best performance for small networks, yet is unable to simulate large-scale networks. At the scale of mammalian brains, the GPU, IPU and TPU achieve speedups ranging from 29x to 1,208x times over CPU runtimes. Remarkably, the TPU sets a new record for the largest, real-time simulation of the inferior-olivary nucleus in the brain. Reduced-accuracy floating-point implementations make some simulation results unreliable for brain research, notably for the GroqChip. Consequently, this work underscores the potential of ML libraries for accelerating brain simulations as well as the critical role of AI-chip numerical accuracy for biophysically realistic brain models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDiabetes, a burgeoning health issue, especially among the youth, stems from poor dietary habits and unhealthy lifestyles. India stands as the second most afflicted country, witnessing a rapid diabetes epidemic. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a significant complication, threatens vision loss and blindness. Early detection, alongside lifestyle adjustments, can manage DR effectively. Traditional methods for DR detection are time consuming, costly and require specialized skills. Computer assisted screening systems, leveraging technologies like Fundus images and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), streamline DR detection, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role. Technological advancements and abundant data fuel significant progress in AI-based DR screening, promising enhanced accuracy and efficiency, even in remote regions. In healthcare, ânormalâ and âabnormalâ statuses characterize patient health. AI applications in healthcare often focus on anomaly detection, leveraging distinct data distributions. Generative architectures, originally designed for content generation, find application across various domains, including healthcare. By adjusting architecture and data pipelines, controlled and specific samples can be generated, offering solutions for anomaly detection.\nThis paper reviews fundamental aspects of diabetes and DR, exploring the utilization of generative AI in analyzing retinal data for DR detection. It also discusses recent advancements in Generative AI and their potential to enhance AI solutions in healthcare.",

However, the empirical research question on how to effectively harness the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the presence of governance dynamics is yet to be addressed in the literature, particularly concerning the BRICS economy. Hence, it is crucial to examine the impact of AI investment on employment and economic growth in the BRICS countries from 2012 to 2022, taking into account the moderating role of overall governance as well as specific governance indicators such as political governance, institutional governance, economic governance etc. Cross-Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) technique is used to analyze the data. The findings of the study suggest a long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables analyzed in both the employment and growth models. The causality results for our main variables of interest differ in the employment-growth models. Based on the CS-ARDL results, the study recommends that BRICS governments and policymakers prioritize and enhance the integration of AI into their governance systems to promote employment and stimulate growth in both the short- and long-term. However, the study cautions against overlooking interaction between AI and general governance as it did not demonstrate support for growth, it is crucial to implement robust measures to mitigate any potential negative effects arising from AI's interaction with political and institutional governance. Therefore, the study proposes the formulation of AI-friendly governance policies among BRICS nations to stimulate employment and growth, recognizing the embryonic status of AI as a pivotal technology in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.",

The proposed work develops a closed-loop simulator for proximity operations scenarios, particularly for the inspection of an unknown and uncooperative target object, with a fully AI-based image processing and GNC chain. This tool is based on four main blocks: image generation, image processing, navigation filter, and guidance and control blocks.

The adoption might be driven by multiple factors influencing the business landscape. Additionally, numerous ethical considerations could impact the deployment of GenAI. This unique study investigated how organizations adopt GenAI and its effects on their performance. Further, this research utilized institutional theory and ethical guidelines for AI design to develop a research framework examining how organizations adopt GenAI and its impact on their performance. A survey of 384 managers from information technology (IT) and information technology-enabled services (ITeS) companies was conducted. Data analysis was done using PLS-SEM to examine and validate the proposed model. The study outcome reveals that institutional pressures, i.e., coercive, normative and mimetic forces, influence the use of GenAI in organizations. It was also found that fairness, accountability, transparency, accuracy and autonomy influence the use of GenAI. Also, the results divulge that the use of GenAI influences organizational performance and is moderated by organizational innovativeness.

By utilising machine learning and deep learning approaches, AI-enabled systems may accomplish tasks as well as improve their own performance. These capabilities are useful in the often-remote settings of outer space and will grow in value as automated space operations become more widespread. As AI extends throughout the space domain, automated algorithms will take on many of the roles that have historically been handled by humans. Artificial intelligence is progressing from theory to implementation in the space environment by exposing new satellites and orbital autonomous vehicles to new data. Even though all initial computational parameters are provided, such systems' outputs can be very unpredictable, putting people, property, and the environment at risk. This paper investigates the application of United Nations space treaties, selected regional AI regulations, and various 'soft-law' instruments and industry initiatives focusing on responsible AI system development to space-based AI systems. Following that, reforms are proposed to clarify the practical relationship between AI systems and the international legal regime that governs space, as well as a 'bottom-up' regulatory approach to better facilitate the future development of regulation governing the use of AI by the global space sector. While this work does not purport to provide a conclusive resolution to these multifaceted matters, its objective is to underscore significant obstacles that arise at the convergence of space law and AI, serving as a preliminary foundation for subsequent discussions on this issue.",

Machine learning models, especially those utilizing complex algorithms like deep learning, have demonstrated major potential in extracting important information from large operational datasets. Despite their efficiency, machine learning models face challenges, making Explainable AI (XAI) crucial for improving their understandability and fine-tuning. The importance of feature contribution and selection using XAI in the diagnosis of machine faults is examined in this study. The technique is applied to evaluate different machine-learning algorithms. Extreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers are used alongside Logistic Regression (LR) as a baseline model because their efficacy and simplicity are evaluated thoroughly with empirical analysis. The XAI is used as a targeted feature selection technique to select among 29 features of the time and frequency domain. The XAI approach is lightweight, trained with only targeted features, and achieved similar results as the traditional approach. The accuracy without XAI on baseline LR is 79.57%, whereas the approach with XAI on LR is 80.28%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nEndometrial CD138+ plasma cells serve as a diagnostic biomarker for endometrial inflammation, and their elevated occurrence correlates positively with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Infertility-related conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) are closely associated with systemic and local chronic inflammatory status, wherein endometrial CD138+ plasma cell accumulation could also contribute to endometrial pathology. Current methods for quantifying CD138+ cells typically involve laborious and time-consuming microscopic assessments of only a few random areas from a slide. These methods have limitations in accurately representing the entire slide and are susceptible to significant biases arising from intra- and interobserver variations. Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) for CD138+ cell identification could enhance the accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability of analysis.\nMethods\nHere, an AI algorithm was developed to identify CD138+ plasma cells within endometrial tissue. The AI model comprised two layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNN1 was trained to segment epithelium and stroma across 28,363â¯mm2 (2.56â¯mm2 of epithelium and 24.87â¯mm2 of stroma), while CNN2 was trained to distinguish stromal cells based on CD138 staining, encompassing 7345 cells in the object layers (6942 CD138â cells and 403 CD138+ cells). The training and performance of the AI model were validated by three experienced pathologists. We collected 193 endometrial tissues from healthy controls (nâ¯=â¯73), women with PCOS (nâ¯=â¯91), and RIF patients (nâ¯=â¯29) and compared the CD138+ cell percentages based on cycle phases, ovulation status, and endometrial receptivity utilizing the AI model.\nResults\nThe AI algorithm consistently and reliably distinguished CD138â and CD138+ cells, with total error rates of 6.32% and 3.23%, respectively. During the training validation, there was a complete agreement between the decisions made by the pathologists and the AI algorithm, while the performance validation demonstrated excellent accuracy between the AI and human evaluation methods (intraclass correlation; 0.76, 95% confidence intervals; 0.36â0.93, pâ¯=â¯0.002) and a positive correlation (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: 0.79, pâ¯<â¯0.01). In the AI analysis, the AI model revealed higher CD138+ cell percentages in the proliferative phase (PE) endometrium compared to the secretory phase or anovulatory PCOS endometrium, irrespective of PCOS diagnosis. Interestingly, CD138+ percentages differed according to PCOS phenotype in the PE (pâ¯=â¯0.03). On the other hand, the receptivity status had no impact on the cell percentages in RIF samples.\nConclusion\nOur findings emphasize the potential and accuracy of the AI algorithm in detecting endometrial CD138+ plasma cells, offering distinct advantages over manual inspection, such as rapid analysis of whole slide images, reduction of intra- and interobserver variations, sparing the valuable time of trained specialists, and consistent productivity. This supports the application of AI technology to help clinical decision-making, for example, in understanding endometrial cycle phase-related dynamics, as well as different reproductive disorders.",

In this paper, we propose a fully automated method, named ACCA, to evaluate the correctness of AI-generated code for security purposes. The method uses symbolic execution to assess whether the AI-generated code behaves as a reference implementation. We use ACCA to assess four state-of-the-art models trained to generate security-oriented assembly code and compare the results of the evaluation with different baseline solutions, including output similarity metrics, widely used in the field, and the well-known ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI.\nOur experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline solutions and assesses the correctness of the AI-generated code similar to the human-based evaluation, which is considered the ground truth for the assessment in the field. Moreover, ACCA has a very strong correlation with the human evaluation (Pearsonâs correlation coefficient\non average). Finally, since it is a full y automated solution that does not require any human intervention, the proposed method performs the assessment of every code snippet in\ns on average, which is definitely lower than the average time required by human analysts to manually inspect the code, based on our experience.",

We believe that AI can be a useful asset to support decision-makers, but not that it should replace decision-makers. Decision-making uses algorithmic analysis, but it is not solely algorithmic analysis; it also involves other factors, many of which are very human, such as creativity, intuition, emotions, feelings, and value judgments. We have conducted semi-structured open-ended research interviews with 17 dermatologists to understand what they expect from an AI application to deliver to medical diagnosis. We have found four aggregate dimensions along which the thinking of dermatologists can be described: the ways in which our participants chose to interact with AI, responsibility, âexplainabilityâ, and the new way of thinking (mindset) needed for working with AI. We believe that our findings will help physicians who might consider using AI in their diagnosis to understand how to use AI beneficially. It will also be useful for AI vendors in improving their understanding of how medics want to use AI in diagnosis. Further research will be needed to examine if our findings have relevance in the wider medical field and beyond.",

This advancement has substantially bolstered industry autonomy, fortifying security and safety through the integration of electronics, internet connectivity, advanced algorithms, and cutting-edge processing chips.\nIn this context, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) leverage AI-powered systems and sensors to optimize performance and proactively thwart potential failures. Going beyond Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), this review scrutinizes the broader spectrum of AI applications. Specifically, it synthesizes pertinent studies encompassing AI's impact on car emissions, predictive maintenance, security, and the realm of connected vehicles.\nWhile AGVs can utilize AI algorithms to chart emission-efficient routes and engineer energy-conservative vehicles, AI, through diverse algorithms, proficiently anticipates component failures, substantially enhancing the cost-effectiveness of predictive maintenance and bolstering vehicle reliability. Moreover, AI integrated with sensor technology safeguards vehicles against a spectrum of threats. Neural networks and machine learning further automate security measures for both cargo and passengers. Concurrently, AI and machine learning fortify traffic control and enhance vehicle communication within connected vehicle frameworks, albeit necessitating fortifications in data security, encryption, and system efficiency.\nThis survey paper comprehensively covers the expanse of automotive AI and machine learning applications, extending beyond ADAS. It underscores that the evolving mobility landscape necessitates a thorough evaluation of network architecture, connectivity, and performance metrics, encompassing AGV technology, networking protocols, and swarm dynamics. In this vein, the paper advocates for experts to address existing literature gaps and proactively enhance automotive systems.",

Despite Sweden's advanced digitalization efforts and the widespread application of AI in the public sector, our study reveals significant gaps between theoretical ambitions and practical outcomes, particularly in the context of AI's trustworthiness. We employ a robust theoretical framework comprising Institutional Theory, the Resource-Based View (RBV), and Ambidexterity Theory, to analyze the challenges and discrepancies in AI implementation within PES.\nOur analysis shows that while AI promises enhanced decision-making efficiency, the reality is marred by issues of transparency, interpretability, and stakeholder engagement. The opacity of the neural network used by the agency to assess jobseekersâ need for support and the lack of comprehensive technical understanding among PES management contribute to the challenges in achieving transparent and interpretable AI systems. Economic pressures for efficiency often overshadow the need for ethical considerations and stakeholder involvement, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of jobseekers.\nWe propose recommendations for enhancing AI's trustworthiness in public services, emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, particularly involving jobseekers in the decision-making process. Our study advocates for a more nuanced balance between the use of advanced AI technologies and the leveraging of internal resources such as skilled personnel and organizational knowledge. We also highlight the need for improved AI literacy among both management and personnel to effectively navigate AI's integration into public decision-making processes.\nOur findings contribute to the ongoing debate on trustworthy AI, offering a detailed case study that bridges the gap between theoretical exploration and practical application. By scrutinizing the AI implementation in the Swedish PES, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for other public sector organizations grappling with the integration of AI into their decision-making processes.",

However, deploying these technologies on low-resource edge devices poses substantial challenges due to their high computational demands and the inherent complexity of Explainable AI (XAI) methods. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel XAI-integrated Visual Quality Inspection framework that optimizes the deployment of semantic segmentation models on low-resource edge devices. Our framework incorporates XAI and the Large Vision Language Model to deliver human-centered interpretability through visual and textual explanations to end-users. This is crucial for end-user trust and model interpretability. We outline a comprehensive methodology consisting of six fundamental modules: base model fine-tuning, XAI-based explanation generation, evaluation of XAI approaches, XAI-guided data augmentation, development of an edge-compatible model, and the generation of understandable visual and textual explanations. Through XAI-guided data augmentation, the enhanced model incorporating domain expert knowledge with visual and textual explanations is successfully deployed on mobile devices to support end-users in real-world scenarios. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the mobile model achieving competitive accuracy while significantly reducing model size. This approach paves the way for the broader adoption of reliable and interpretable AI tools in critical industrial applications, where decisions must be both rapid and justifiable.

This is partially owing to a lack of user-centered design of AI-based computer-aided detection or diagnosis (AI-CAD) systems.\nObjective\nWe aimed to assess the impact of different onboarding tutorials and levels of AI model explainability on radiologistsâ trust in AI and the use of AI recommendations in lung nodule assessment on computed tomography (CT) scans.\nMethods\nIn total, 20 radiologists from 7 Dutch medical centers performed lung nodule assessment on CT scans under different conditions in a simulated use study as part of a 2Ã2 repeated-measures quasi-experimental design. Two types of AI onboarding tutorials (reflective vs informative) and 2 levels of AI output (black box vs explainable) were designed. The radiologists first received an onboarding tutorial that was either informative or reflective. Subsequently, each radiologist assessed 7 CT scans, first without AI recommendations. AI recommendations were shown to the radiologist, and they could adjust their initial assessment. Half of the participants received the recommendations via black box AI output and half received explainable AI output. Mental model and psychological trust were measured before onboarding, after onboarding, and after assessing the 7 CT scans. We recorded whether radiologists changed their assessment on found nodules, malignancy prediction, and follow-up advice for each CT assessment. In addition, we analyzed whether radiologistsâ trust in their assessments had changed based on the AI recommendations.\nResults\nBoth variations of onboarding tutorials resulted in a significantly improved mental model of the AI-CAD system (informative P=.01 and reflective P=.01). After using AI-CAD, psychological trust significantly decreased for the group with explainable AI output (P=.02). On the basis of the AI recommendations, radiologists changed the number of reported nodules in 27 of 140 assessments, malignancy prediction in 32 of 140 assessments, and follow-up advice in 12 of 140 assessments. The changes were mostly an increased number of reported nodules, a higher estimated probability of malignancy, and earlier follow-up. The radiologistsâ confidence in their found nodules changed in 82 of 140 assessments, in their estimated probability of malignancy in 50 of 140 assessments, and in their follow-up advice in 28 of 140 assessments. These changes were predominantly increases in confidence. The number of changed assessments and radiologistsâ confidence did not significantly differ between the groups that received different onboarding tutorials and AI outputs.\nConclusions\nOnboarding tutorials help radiologists gain a better understanding of AI-CAD and facilitate the formation of a correct mental model. If AI explanations do not consistently substantiate the probability of malignancy across patient cases, radiologistsâ trust in the AI-CAD system can be impaired. Radiologistsâ confidence in their assessments was improved by using the AI recommendations.",

The broad access and usage of AI enable immense benefits but also give rise to significant challenges. One way for AI users to address these challenges is to develop AI literacy, referring to human proficiency in different subject areas of AI that enable purposeful, efficient, and ethical usage of AI technologies. This study aims to comprehensively understand and structure the research on AI literacy for AI users through a systematic, scoping literature review. Therefore, we synthesize the literature, provide a conceptual framework, and develop a research agenda. Our review paper holistically assesses the fragmented AI literacy research landscape (68 papers) while critically examining its specificity to different user groups and its distinction from other technology literacies, exposing that research efforts are partly not well integrated. We organize our findings in an overarching conceptual framework structured along the learning methods leading to, the components constituting, and the effects stemming from AI literacy. Our research agenda â oriented along the developed conceptual framework â sheds light on the most promising research opportunities to prepare AI users for an AI-powered future of work and society.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nCapsule endoscopy reading is time consuming, and readers are required to maintain attention so as not to miss significant findings. Deep convolutional neural networks can recognise relevant findings, possibly exceeding human performances and reducing the reading time of capsule endoscopy. Our primary aim was to assess the non-inferiority of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted reading versus standard reading for potentially small bowel bleeding lesions (high P2, moderate P1; Saurin classification) at per-patient analysis. The mean reading time in both reading modalities was evaluated among the secondary endpoints.\nMethods\nPatients aged 18 years or older with suspected small bowel bleeding (with anaemia with or without melena or haematochezia, and negative bidirectional endoscopy) were prospectively enrolled at 14 European centres. Patients underwent small bowel capsule endoscopy with the Navicam SB system (Ankon, China), which is provided with a deep neural network-based AI system (ProScan) for automatic detection of lesions. Initial reading was performed in standard reading mode. Second blinded reading was performed with AI assistance (the AI operated a first-automated reading, and only AI-selected images were assessed by human readers). The primary endpoint was to assess the non-inferiority of AI-assisted reading versus standard reading in the detection (diagnostic yield) of potentially small bowel bleeding P1 and P2 lesions in a per-patient analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04821349.\nFindings\nFrom Feb 17, 2021 to Dec 29, 2021, 137 patients were prospectively enrolled. 133 patients were included in the final analysis (73 [55%] female, mean age 66Â·5 years [SD 14Â·4]; 112 [84%] completed capsule endoscopy). At per-patient analysis, the diagnostic yield of P1 and P2 lesions in AI-assisted reading (98 [73Â·7%] of 133 lesions) was non-inferior (p<0Â·0001) and superior (p=0Â·0213) to standard reading (82 [62Â·4%] of 133; 95% CI 3Â·6â19Â·0). Mean small bowel reading time was 33Â·7 min (SD 22Â·9) in standard reading and 3Â·8 min (3Â·3) in AI-assisted reading (p<0Â·0001).\nInterpretation\nAI-assisted reading might provide more accurate and faster detection of clinically relevant small bowel bleeding lesions than standard reading.\nFunding\nANKON Technologies, China and AnX Robotica, USA provided the NaviCam SB system.",

However, thumbnail designs still constitute a black box regarding their effects on consumption. To address this research gap, we apply artificial intelligence (AI) based imagery analysis to quantify and analyze almost 500,000 thumbnails drawn from two international digital media platforms â an advertisement-based video-sharing platform and a sales-oriented e-commerce one. Through multiple linear regression analyses, we provide quantitative evidence on the relationship between thumbnail designs and the consumption of hedonic media goods. For both digital media platforms, we find that several classes of visual cues and more faces especially with negative emotions foster consumption, while more text decreases consumption. We also find several distinct impacts on consumption across the two digital media platforms that we explain with the different underlying business models. We contribute to the literature on visual information processing and choice, AI-based design, and platform and e-commerce strategies. Further, we supplement the inventory of Information Systems (IS) research methods by adding AI-based imagery analysis. We provide implications for practice concerning AI-based thumbnail design and strategic pathways for digital platforms and offer directions for future research. We conclude with some key insights and a brief outlook.",

However, such public AI can potentially infringe on citizensâ right to autonomy. Contestability is a system quality that protects against this by ensuring systems are open and responsive to disputes throughout their life cycle. While a growing body of work is investigating contestable AI by design, little of this knowledge has so far been evaluated with practitioners. To make explicit the guiding ideas underpinning contestable AI research, we construct the generative metaphor of the Agonistic Arena, inspired by the political theory of agonistic pluralism. Combining this metaphor and current contestable AI guidelines, we develop an infographic supporting the early-stage concept design of public AI system contestability mechanisms. We evaluate this infographic in five workshops paired with focus groups with a total of 18 practitioners, yielding ten concept designs. Our findings outline the mechanisms for contestability derived from these concept designs. Building on these findings, we subsequently evaluate the efficacy of the Agonistic Arena as a generative metaphor for the design of public AI and identify two competing metaphors at play in this space: the Black Box and the Sovereign.",

We developed assignments for brainstorming research questions, writing counterarguments, and editing assistance using the AI tools Elicit, Fermat, and Wordtune. Students felt that the tools were helpful for finding ideas to get started with writing, to find sources once they had started writing, and to get help with counterarguments and alternate word choices. But when given the choice to use the assistants or not, most declined. Generative AI at this stage is unreliable, and many students found the tradeoff in reviewing AI suggestions to be too time consuming. And many students expressed a preference for continuing to develop their own voices through writing. Our experience in engaging AI led to the creation of the DEER praxis, which emphasizes defined engagements with AI tools for specific purposes, and generous use of reflection.",

While the impact of these tools on language teaching and learning has been widely speculated, the perspective of language teacher educators concerning their influence on initial language teacher education (ILTE) remains unexplored. This study investigates how teacher educators, who play a crucial role in adapting ILTE to technological advancements, perceive the effects of generative AI tools on ILTE. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with thirteen English language teacher educators from all four Hong Kong government-funded universities offering ILTE. Findings reveal that participants believe generative AI tools will substantially affect the ILTE curriculum, instruction, and assessment. However, most participants believed they lacked the confidence and competence to address the implications of generative AI tools effectively. This study highlights the need for further research and training to support teacher educators in adapting ILTE to the emerging influence of generative AI.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAlthough the use of artificial intelligence (AI)âbased technologies, such as AI-based decision support systems (AI-DSSs), can help sustain and improve the quality and efficiency of care, their deployment creates ethical and social challenges. In recent years, a growing prevalence of high-level guidelines and frameworks for responsible AI innovation has been observed. However, few studies have specified the responsible embedding of AI-based technologies, such as AI-DSSs, in specific contexts, such as the nursing process in long-term care (LTC) for older adults.\nObjective\nPrerequisites for responsible AI-assisted decision-making in nursing practice were explored from the perspectives of nurses and other professional stakeholders in LTC.\nMethods\nSemistructured interviews were conducted with 24 care professionals in Dutch LTC, including nurses, care coordinators, data specialists, and care centralists. A total of 2 imaginary scenarios about AI-DSSs were developed beforehand and used to enable participants articulate their expectations regarding the opportunities and risks of AI-assisted decision-making. In addition, 6 high-level principles for responsible AI were used as probing themes to evoke further consideration of the risks associated with using AI-DSSs in LTC. Furthermore, the participants were asked to brainstorm possible strategies and actions in the design, implementation, and use of AI-DSSs to address or mitigate these risks. A thematic analysis was performed to identify the opportunities and risks of AI-assisted decision-making in nursing practice and the associated prerequisites for responsible innovation in this area.\nResults\nThe stance of care professionals on the use of AI-DSSs is not a matter of purely positive or negative expectations but rather a nuanced interplay of positive and negative elements that lead to a weighed perception of the prerequisites for responsible AI-assisted decision-making. Both opportunities and risks were identified in relation to the early identification of care needs, guidance in devising care strategies, shared decision-making, and the workload of and work experience of caregivers. To optimally balance the opportunities and risks of AI-assisted decision-making, seven categories of prerequisites for responsible AI-assisted decision-making in nursing practice were identified: (1) regular deliberation on data collection; (2) a balanced proactive nature of AI-DSSs; (3) incremental advancements aligned with trust and experience; (4) customization for all user groups, including clients and caregivers; (5) measures to counteract bias and narrow perspectives; (6) human-centric learning loops; and (7) the routinization of using AI-DSSs.\nConclusions\nThe opportunities of AI-assisted decision-making in nursing practice could turn into drawbacks depending on the specific shaping of the design and deployment of AI-DSSs. Therefore, we recommend considering the responsible use of AI-DSSs as a balancing act. Moreover, considering the interrelatedness of the identified prerequisites, we call for various actors, including developers and users of AI-DSSs, to cohesively address the different factors important to the responsible embedding of AI-DSSs in practice.",

We examine how seemingly compelling claims are tested as AI tools move into real-world settings and discuss how analysts can develop effective understandings in novel and rapidly changing settings.\nFour case studies highlight the challenges of utilising diagnostic AI tools at differing stages in their innovation journey. Two âupstreamâ cases seeking to demonstrate the practical applicability of AI and two âdownstreamâ cases focusing on the roll out and scaling of more established applications.\nWe observed an unfolding uncoordinated process of social learning capturing two key moments: i) experiments to create and establish the clinical potential of AI tools; and, ii) attempts to verify their dependability in clinical settings while extending their scale and scope. Health professionals critically appraise tool performance, relying on them selectively where their results can be demonstrably trusted, in a de facto model of responsible use. We note a shift from procuring stand-alone solutions to deploying suites of AI tools through platforms to facilitate adoption and reduce the costs of procurement, implementation and evaluation which impede the viability of stand-alone solutions.\nNew conceptual frameworks and methodological strategies are needed to address the rapid evolution of AI tools as they move from research settings and are deployed in real-world care across multiple settings. We observe how, in this process of deployment, AI tools become âdomesticatedâ. We propose longitudinal and multisite âbiographicalâ investigations of medical AI rather than snapshot studies of emerging technologies that fail to capture change and variation in performance across contexts.",

Retinal imaging of 240 eyes was obtained using non-mydriatic fundus photography. The fundus images of these patients were divided into two groups based on different interpretation methods. In Experiment Group 1, the images were analyzed and graded for DR diagnosis using an AI reading platform. In Experiment Group 2, the images were analyzed and graded for DR diagnosis by an associate chief physician in ophthalmology, specializing in fundus diseases. Concurrently, all patients underwent the gold standard for DR diagnosis and gradingâfundus fluorescein angiography (FFA)âwith the outcomes serving as the Control Group. The diagnostic value of the two methods was assessed by comparing the results of Experiment Groups 1 and 2 with those of the Control Group.\nResults\nKeeping the control group (FFA results) as the gold standard, no significant differences were observed between the two experimental groups regarding diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, Youden's index, Kappa value, and diagnostic accuracy (X2 = 0.371, P > 0.05).\nConclusion\nCompared with the manual reading group, the AI reading group revealed no significant differences across all diagnostic indicators, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity, as well as a relatively high positive predictive value. Additionally, it demonstrated a high level of diagnostic consistency with the gold standard. This technology holds potential for suitability in large-scale screening of DR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe integration of artificial intelligence into auditing shows great potential in enhancing automation and gaining insights from complex data. However, it also presents significant ethical challenges, including algorithmic biases, transparency, accountability, and fairness. This study aimed to investigate the sources of bias and risks posed by AI systems applied in auditing and the complex downstream interactions and effects they have. The study also explored the technical and ethical guardrails proposed and recommendations for translating principles into auditing practice. A systematic methodology was employed to acquire relevant studies across scientific databases. This involved a three-step process, including a targeted search query using Boolean operators and snowballing to yield 310 preliminary publications. A systematic review process was then conducted to identify 123 relevant articles focused on AI's implications for auditing, accounting, finance, or assurance contexts. Finally, screening and filtering on research quality distilled 83 high-quality publications from the year 2018 to 2023 spanning computer science, accounting, management science, and ethics disciplines. The analysis revealed five primary sources driving technical and human biases: data deficiencies, demographic homogeneity, spurious correlations, improper comparators, and cognitive biases. It also highlighted wider issues, such as trade-offs between efficiency and diligence, erosion of human skills and judgement, data dependence risks, and privacy violations from uncontrolled personal data exploitation. The study found promising remedies, including causal modeling to enable auditors to uncover subtle biases, representative algorithmic testing to evaluate fairness, periodic auditing of AI systems, human oversight alongside automation, and embedding ethical values like fairness and accountability into system design. The study concludes that auditors play a crucial role in assessing and ensuring AI's reliable and socially beneficial integration. It recommends governance, risk assessment before deployment, ongoing performance monitoring, and policies fostering trust and collaboration to responsibly translate principles into auditing practice.",

The adoption of AI may cause substitution away from risk management activities used when rules are applied (rules require always taking the same action), instead allowing for decision-making (choosing actions based on the predicted state). We provide a formal model evaluating the impact of AI and how risk management, stakes, and interrelated tasks affect AI adoption. The broad conclusion is that AI adoption can be stymied by existing processes designed to address uncertainty. In particular, many processes are designed to enable coordinated decision-making among different organizational actors. AI can make coordination even more challenging. However, when the cost of changing such processes falls, then the returns from AI adoption increase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrent studies on the artificial intelligence (AI) ethics focus either on very broad guidelines or on a very special domain. Therefore, the research outcome can hardly be converted into actionable measures or transferred to other domains. Potential correlations between various cases of AI ethics at different granularity levels are unexplored. To overcome these deficiencies, the authors designed a case-oriented ontological model (COOM) and a hyper-knowledge graph system (HKGS) for the research of collected AI ethics cases. COOM describes criteria for modelling cases by attributes from three perspectives: event attributes, relational attributes, and positional attributes on the value chain. Based on it, HKGS stores the correlation between cases as knowledge and allows advanced visual analysis. The correlations between cases and their dynamic changes on value chain can be observed and explored. In HKGS's implementation part, one of the collected ethics cases is used as an example to demonstrate how to generate a hyper-knowledge graph and to visually analyze it. The authors also anticipated how different practitioners of AI ethics, can achieve the desired outputs from HKGS in their diverse scenarios.",

However, alongside these advancements, there is growing concern about ethical considerations, such as bias, informed consent, and trust in the development of these technologies.\nObjective\nThis study aims to assess the role of ethics in the development of AI-based applications in medicine. Furthermore, this study focuses on the potential consequences of neglecting ethical considerations in AI development, particularly their impact on patients and physicians.\nMethods\nQualitative content analysis was used to analyze the responses from expert interviews. Experts were selected based on their involvement in the research or practical development of AI-based applications in medicine for at least 5 years, leading to the inclusion of 7 experts in the study.\nResults\nThe analysis revealed 3 main categories and 7 subcategories reflecting a wide range of views on the role of ethics in AI development. This variance underscores the subjectivity and complexity of integrating ethics into the development of AI in medicine. Although some experts view ethics as fundamental, others prioritize performance and efficiency, with some perceiving ethics as potential obstacles to technological progress. This dichotomy of perspectives clearly emphasizes the subjectivity and complexity surrounding the role of ethics in AI development, reflecting the inherent multifaceted nature of this issue.\nConclusions\nDespite the methodological limitations impacting the generalizability of the results, this study underscores the critical importance of consistent and integrated ethical considerations in AI development for medical applications. It advocates further research into effective strategies for ethical AI development, emphasizing the need for transparent and responsible practices, consideration of diverse data sources, physician training, and the establishment of comprehensive ethical and legal frameworks.",

Through focus group discussions and case studies, this paper demonstrates the potential of GenAI in reshaping the various stages of the composition process, including invention, designing, and revising. The findings reveal that GenAI technologies have the potential to enhance studentsâ multimodal composition practices and offer alternative solutions to the wicked problems encountered during the design process. Specifically, GenAI facilitates invention by offering design inspirations and enriches designing by expanding, removing, and editing the student-produced design contents. The students in this study also shared their critical stance on the revision process by modifying and iterating their designs after their uses of GenAI. Through showcasing both the opportunities and challenges of GenAI technologies, this paper contributes to the ongoing scholarly conversations on multimodal composition and pedagogy. Moreover, the paper offers implications for the future research and teaching of GenAI-assisted multimodal composition projects, with the aim of encouraging thoughtful integration of GenAI technologies to foster critical AI literacy among college composition students.",

This study underscores the pressing need for an expectation management framework to align stakeholder anticipations before any system-related activities, such as data collection, modeling, or implementation. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive framework tailored to capture end-user expectations specifically for trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. To ensure its relevance and robustness, we validated the framework via semi-structured interviews, encompassing questions rooted in the framework's constructs and principles. These interviews engaged fourteen diverse end users across the healthcare and education sectors, including physicians, teachers, and students. Through a meticulous qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts, we unearthed pivotal themes and discerned varying perspectives among the interviewee groups. Ultimately, our framework stands as a pivotal tool, paving the way for in-depth discussions about user expectations, illuminating the significance of various system attributes, and spotlighting potential challenges that might jeopardize the system's efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nData infrastructures are expanding rapidly across African societies, renewing the promise of modernisation, and providing a massive data resource to the dominant tech powers of the world. Google's private undersea cable, named Equiano, landed in west Africa with the intention of igniting data services, smart environments, investment opportunities and jobs. Non-governmental and multilateral agencies are busy supporting African governments in building regulatory frameworks that aim to âreadyâ countries for the 4th industrial revolution. Young Africans labour in remodelled shipping containers to annotate data and train algorithms. While future promises pan out in wide-angled, utopian visions, this paper sets out an approach to understand African contexts as sites of heterogeneous experience of data infrastructures that are historically and politically contingent. The paper explores the spatial politics of extraction, surveillance, and exploitation in three examples of the Equiano pipeline, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Readiness Index, and the AI annotative labour force. We challenge the homogenising discourses of global tech companies and transnational governance institutions in accounting for the geographical histories of colonialism and its afterlives in African societies. We further call for empirical studies that examine the granular multiplicities of data, providing nuanced understandings of AI in and from Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nStreptococcus suis is a significant zoonotic agent affecting both human and pig health and poses a substantial public health concern. The pathogenicity of S. suis is intricately linked to its ability to form biofilms and express virulence factors, which are regulated by the LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing (QS) system. Herein, we uncover a novel therapeutic avenue by demonstrating that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an FDA-approved anti-cancer agent, effectively mitigates biofilm formation and attenuates the virulence of S. suis. Mechanistically, we observe a significant reduction in capsular polysaccharide and extracellular polysaccharide production upon 5-FU treatment, elucidating a potential mechanism for biofilm weakening. Additionally, 5-FU down-regulates virulence traits, diminishing S. suisâs ability to adhere to host cells and evade phagocytosis. Crucially, our study identifies the thymidylate synthase regulatory gene thyA as a key mediator of 5-FUâs effects on the LuxS/AI-2 QS system. Virtual molecular docking and gene knockout experiments provide compelling evidence that 5-FU modulates the LuxS/AI-2 QS system by targeting thyA. In vivo experiments further validate the therapeutic potential of 5-FU, showcasing a significant reduction in bacterial load and mitigation of tissue damage in a mouse model. In conclusion, our investigation unveils 5-FU as a potent disruptor of S. suisâs biofilm formation and virulence, offering a promising avenue for the control of this devastating pathogen.",

The article begins with a brief overview of the development and characteristics of generative AI (GenAI). Elaborating on the implications of GenAI, we provide examples to demonstrate four mechanisms of LLMs: translation, summarization, classification, and amplification. These mechanisms inform a framework that highlights how LLMs enable the creation of innovative solutions for organizations through capacities in two dimensions: context awareness and content awareness. The strength of LLMs lies in the combination of capacities in both these dimensions, which enables them to comprehend and amplify content. Four managerial suggestions are presented, ranging from starting out with small-scale projects and data exploration, to scaling through integration efforts and educating prompt engineers. By presenting the framework, recommendations, and examples of use cases in various contexts, the article contributes to the emerging literature on GenAI and innovation.",

    "abstract": "Infodemics pose significant dangers to public health and to the societal fabric, as the spread of misinformation can have far-reaching consequences. While artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to craft compelling and valuable information campaigns with positive repercussions for public health and democracy, concerns have arisen regarding the potential use of AI systems to generate convincing disinformation. The consequences of this dual nature of AI, capable of both illuminating and obscuring the information landscape, are complex and multifaceted. We contend that the rapid integration of AI into society demands a comprehensive understanding of its ethical implications and the development of strategies to harness its potential for the greater good while mitigating harm. Thus, in this paper we explore the ethical dimensions of AIâs role in information dissemination and impact on public health, arguing that potential strategies to deal with AI and disinformation encompass generating regulated and transparent data sets used to train AI models, regulating content outputs, and promoting information literacy.",

    "abstract": "Background\nBrief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development.\nObjective\nThis research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process.\nMethods\nLeveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherence for individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior change techniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques.\nResults\nWe deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting.\nConclusions\nThis research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors.",

ChatGPT demonstrates growing potential in structured radiology reportingâa field where AI has traditionally focused on image analysis.\nMethods\nA comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted from inception through May 2024, and primary studies discussing ChatGPT's role in structured radiology reporting were selected based on their content.\nResults\nOf the 268 articles screened, eight were ultimately included in this review. These articles explored various applications of ChatGPT, such as generating structured reports from unstructured reports, extracting data from free text, generating impressions from radiology findings and creating structured reports from imaging data. All studies demonstrated optimism regarding ChatGPT's potential to aid radiologists, though common critiques included data privacy concerns, reliability, medical errors, and lack of medical-specific training.\nConclusion\nChatGPT and assistive AI have significant potential to transform radiology reporting, enhancing accuracy and standardization while optimizing healthcare resources. Future developments may involve integrating dynamic few-shot prompting, ChatGPT, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into diagnostic workflows. Continued research, development, and ethical oversight are crucial to fully realize AI's potential in radiology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe use of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) has become increasingly significant globally. In China, there is a lack of research examining the behavioral intention toward AIEd among pre-service special education (SPED) teachers in terms of digital literacy and teacher self-efficacy. Building on the technology acceptance model, our study evaluated the aspects influencing pre-service special education teachersâ intention toward AI in education. Data was gathered from 274 pre-service SPED teachers studying at a Chinese public normal university of special education and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that digital literacy is associated with the perceived usefulness and ease of use of AIEd, which influences SPED teachers' intention to use AIEd. Additionally, digital literacy significantly impacts the self-efficacy of SPED teachers. Given these results, AI designers in special education should comprehend the effectiveness and usability of AIEd for fostering behavioral intention formation. Simultaneously, special educational programs that identify key content and activities for digital literacy training should be developed, and educators should attempt to execute the relevant pre-service training to enhance the intention of pre-service SPED teachers toward AIEd.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground and Objective\nIt is unknown whether large language models (LLMs) may facilitate time- and resource-intensive text-related processes in evidence appraisal. The objective was to quantify the agreement of LLMs with human consensus in appraisal of scientific reporting (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA]) and methodological rigor (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews [AMSTAR]) of systematic reviews and design of clinical trials (PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary 2 [PRECIS-2]) and to identify areas where collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) would outperform the traditional consensus process of human raters in efficiency.\nStudy Design and Setting\nFive LLMs (Claude-3-Opus, Claude-2, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x22B) assessed 112 systematic reviews applying the PRISMA and AMSTAR criteria and 56 randomized controlled trials applying PRECIS-2. We quantified the agreement between human consensus and (1) individual human raters; (2) individual LLMs; (3) combined LLMs approach; (4) humanâAI collaboration. Ratings were marked as deferred (undecided) in case of inconsistency between combined LLMs or between the human rater and the LLM.\nResults\nIndividual human rater accuracy was 89% for PRISMA and AMSTAR, and 75% for PRECIS-2. Individual LLM accuracy was ranging from 63% (GPT-3.5) to 70% (Claude-3-Opus) for PRISMA, 53% (GPT-3.5) to 74% (Claude-3-Opus) for AMSTAR, and 38% (GPT-4) to 55% (GPT-3.5) for PRECIS-2. Combined LLM ratings led to accuracies of 75%â88% for PRISMA (4%â74% deferred), 74%â89% for AMSTAR (6%â84% deferred), and 64%â79% for PRECIS-2 (29%â88% deferred). HumanâAI collaboration resulted in the best accuracies from 89% to 96% for PRISMA (25/35% deferred), 91%â95% for AMSTAR (27/30% deferred), and 80%â86% for PRECIS-2 (76/71% deferred).\nConclusion\nCurrent LLMs alone appraised evidence worse than humans. HumanâAI collaboration may reduce workload for the second human rater for the assessment of reporting (PRISMA) and methodological rigor (AMSTAR) but not for complex tasks such as PRECIS-2.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (290KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Amid such hyperbole, the more nuanced trajectories of this technology have been neglected. In this article, we use the Trajectories of Technology (ToT) framework developed by Berthon and colleagues to explore the disparate paths that AI has taken and will take in the coming years, especially in the form of chatbots.

    "abstract": "Background\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionize health care, but this raises risk concerns. It is therefore crucial to understand how clinicians trust and accept AI technology. Gastroenterology, by its nature of being an image-based and intervention-heavy specialty, is an area where AI-assisted diagnosis and management can be applied extensively.\nObjective\nThis study aimed to study how gastroenterologists or gastrointestinal surgeons accept and trust the use of AI in computer-aided detection (CADe), computer-aided characterization (CADx), and computer-aided intervention (CADi) of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy.\nMethods\nWe conducted a web-based questionnaire from November 2022 to January 2023, involving 5 countries or areas in the Asia-Pacific region. The questionnaire included variables such as background and demography of users; intention to use AI, perceived risk; acceptance; and trust in AI-assisted detection, characterization, and intervention. We presented participants with 3 AI scenarios related to colonoscopy and the management of colorectal polyps. These scenarios reflect existing AI applications in colonoscopy, namely the detection of polyps (CADe), characterization of polyps (CADx), and AI-assisted polypectomy (CADi).\nResults\nIn total, 165 gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal surgeons responded to a web-based survey using the structured questionnaire designed by experts in medical communications. Participants had a mean age of 44 (SD 9.65) years, were mostly male (n=116, 70.3%), and mostly worked in publicly funded hospitals (n=110, 66.67%). Participants reported relatively high exposure to AI, with 111 (67.27%) reporting having used AI for clinical diagnosis or treatment of digestive diseases. Gastroenterologists are highly interested to use AI in diagnosis but show different levels of reservations in risk prediction and acceptance of AI. Most participants (n=112, 72.72%) also expressed interest to use AI in their future practice. CADe was accepted by 83.03% (n=137) of respondents, CADx was accepted by 78.79% (n=130), and CADi was accepted by 72.12% (n=119). CADe and CADx were trusted by 85.45% (n=141) of respondents and CADi was trusted by 72.12% (n=119). There were no application-specific differences in risk perceptions, but more experienced clinicians gave lesser risk ratings.\nConclusions\nGastroenterologists reported overall high acceptance and trust levels of using AI-assisted colonoscopy in the management of colorectal polyps. However, this level of trust depends on the application scenario. Moreover, the relationship among risk perception, acceptance, and trust in using AI in gastroenterology practice is not straightforward.",

These algorithms, drawing upon methodologies from fields such as natural language processing and advanced image analysis, can significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting cancer-related molecular states. Notably, Transformer models, renowned for their proficiency in handling extensive datasets, are now being adapted for breakthroughs in medical diagnostics or in stratifying patients according to prognostic levels. Our study contributes to the field of precision medicine by integrating Transformer-based learning, exemplified by the Geneformer model, with explainable AI techniques. These techniques are employed to find out the input variables (genes resulting from genomic transcription) most correlated with the decisions of neural network systems. This insight, a key goal in genomic research, aims to select the most relevant gene subset for each specific task in which a neural network is employed. This selection approach has proven to be effective in two classification tasks: cell type classification and breast cancer type classification. Such effectiveness has been demonstrated even across various cohorts of patients. When applying Geneformer-like architecture analyses solely to the selected gene subsets, the outcomes either maintain their accuracy or significantly improve. This approach, aims not only to contribute to the identification of vital genetic markers in cancer genomics, but also to exemplify the adaptability of AI models to different datasets, marking a significant step towards the development of accurate and universally applicable diagnostic tools for precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "In the intelligent medical diagnosis area, Artificial Intelligence (AI)âs trustworthiness, reliability, and interpretability are critical, especially in cancer diagnosis. Traditional neural networks, while excellent at processing natural images, often lack interpretability and adaptability when processing high-resolution digital pathological images. This limitation is particularly evident in pathological diagnosis, which is the gold standard of cancer diagnosis and relies on a pathologistâs careful examination and analysis of digital pathological slides to identify the features and progression of the disease. Therefore, the integration of interpretable AI into smart medical diagnosis is not only an inevitable technological trend but also a key to improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Multi-Scale Multi-Branch Feature Encoder (MSBE) and present the design of the CrossLinkNet Framework. The MSBE enhances the networkâs capability for feature extraction by allowing the adjustment of hyperparameters to configure the number of branches and modules. The CrossLinkNet Framework, serving as a versatile image segmentation network architecture, employs cross-layer encoder-decoder connections for multi-level feature fusion, thereby enhancing feature integration and segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two datasets demonstrate that CrossLinkNet, equipped with the MSBE encoder, not only achieves accurate segmentation results but is also adaptable to various tumor segmentation tasks and scenarios by replacing different feature encoders. Crucially, CrossLinkNet emphasizes the interpretability of the AI model, a crucial aspect for medical professionals, providing an in-depth understanding of the modelâs decisions and thereby enhancing trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.",

While AI offers promising opportunities for improving CRIS functionalities, it also raises significant ethical challenges that must be addressed. This paper examines the ethical implications of AI implementation in CRIS, focusing on issues such as autonomy, discrimination, data protection, and user rights. Drawing on insights from machine, technology, digital, and robot ethics, the paper explores strategies for mitigating these challenges and fostering responsible AI use in CRIS. Additionally, it highlights the impact of AI technology on CRIS staff and emphasizes the importance of considering societal and personal effects alongside technological advancements. By raising awareness of ethical considerations and promoting ethical AI practices, this paper aims to contribute to the development and acceptance of AI technologies in CRIS, particularly in the light of forthcoming regulations such as the EU AI Act.",

However, this compression standard will in the near future be complemented by a new, highly efficient learning-based compression standard called JPEG AI. JPEG AI is fundamentally different from classical JPEG. Hence, its forensic traces can also be expected to be fundamentally different. We argue that there is a pressing need for image forensics research to investigate these traces.\nIn this work, we characterize forensic compression traces of different AI compression algorithms. Our analysis investigates AI compression artifacts in frequency domain and in spatial domain. Both domains exhibit similar artifacts that likely stem from upsampling operations of the decoders. Additionally, we report for one AI codec another artifact in homogeneous regions. We also investigate the artifact detectability in several scenarios including unseen AI compression traces and postprocessing. Here, frequency and autocorrelation features are better on additive noise and classical JPEG post-compression, while RGB features perform better on blurred and downsampled images.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (254KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

AI is expected to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, there is a lacuna in the literature regarding systematically forecasting `AI's impact on different facets of SDGs over time in various countries. Moreover, though existing literature has reported a correlation between AI and innovation, no prior studies have forecast the influence of AI-based innovation on SDG Outcomes. To fill these significant research gaps, this study forecasts the impact of AI-based innovation on achieving SDGs over nine years, extending from 2022 to 2030 in 22 countries (including both developed and developing countries) across five continents via system dynamics modeling-based simulation and grounded in Institutional Theory (Technology Enactment Framework). The findings exhibit varying impacts on different SDGs. This study enriches the AI, innovation, and sustainable development literature by providing forecasts of the intricate relationship between AI, innovation, and SDGs, thereby offering valuable insights to the reader.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nConfirmation bias colors psychologists' reactions to AI recommendations.\nâ¢\nPsychologists favor AI recommendations congruent with their initial diagnoses.\nâ¢\nCongruent recommendations are accepted more and perceived as more trustworthy.\nâ¢\nHigher expertise elevates skepticism of incongruent AI recommendations.\nâ¢\nAI debiasing of experts may be difficult due to confirmation bias.\nAbstract\nThe surging global demand for mental healthcare (MH) services has amplified the interest in utilizing AI-assisted technologies in critical MH components, including assessment and triage. However, while reducing practitioner burden through decision support is a priority in MH-AI integration, the impact of AI systems on practitioner decisions remains under-researched. This study is the first to investigate the interplay between practitioner judgments and AI recommendations in MH diagnostic decision-making. Using a between-subjects vignette design, the study deployed a mock AI system to provide information about patient triage and assessments to a sample of MH professionals and psychology students with a strong understanding of assessments and triage procedures. Findings showed that participants were more inclined to trust and accept AI recommendations when they aligned with their initial diagnoses and professional intuition. Moreover, those claiming higher expertise demonstrated increased skepticism when AI's suggestions deviated from their professional judgment. The study underscores that MH practitioners neither show unwavering trust in, nor complete adherence to AI, but rather exhibit confirmation bias, predominantly favoring suggestions mirroring their pre-existing beliefs. These insights suggest that while practitioners can potentially correct faulty AI recommendations, the utility of implementing debiased AI to counteract practitioner biases warrants additional investigation.",

Correct diagnosis requires the identification of precise morphological features such basal plasmacytosis. However, histopathological interpretation can be challenging, and it is subject to high variability.\nAim\nThe IBD-Artificial Intelligence (AI) project aims at the development of an AI-based evaluation system to support the diagnosis of IBD, semi-automatically quantifying basal plasmacytosis.\nMethods\nA deep learning model was trained to detect and quantify plasma cells on a public dataset of 4981 annotated images. The model was then tested on an external validation cohort of 356 intestinal biopsies of CD, UC and healthy controls. AI diagnostic performance was calculated compared to human gold standard.\nResults\nThe system correctly found that CD and UC samples had a greater prevalence of basal plasma cells with mean number of PCs within ROIs of 38.22 (95 % CI: 31.73, 49.04) for CD, 55.16 (46.57, 65.93) for UC, and 17.25 (CI: 12.17, 27.05) for controls. Overall, OR=4.968 (CI: 1.835, 14.638) was found for IBD compared to normal mucosa (CD: +59 %; UC: +129 %). Additionally, as expected, UC samples were found to have more plasma cells in colon than CD cases.\nConclusion\nOur model accurately replicated human assessment of basal plasmacytosis, underscoring the value of AI models as a potential aid IBD diagnosis.",

Automating this would enable precision medicine, particularly if providing information on etiology not captured by deep learning (DL) methods. We present AIMMeR, an AI-based method for determination of mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression at a single-cell level in routine pathology samples. AIMMeR shows an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) of 0.98, and specificity of â¥75% at 98% sensitivity against pathologist ground truth in stage II/III in two trial cohorts, with positive predictive value of â¥98% for the commonest pattern of somatic MMRd. Lower agreement with microsatellite instability (MSI) testing (AUROC 0.86) reflects discordance between MMR and MSI PCR rather than AIMMeR misclassification. Analysis of the SCOT trial confirms MMRd prognostic value in oxaliplatin-treated patients; while MMRd does not predict differential benefit of chemotherapy duration, it correlates with difference in relapse by regimen (PInteraction = 0.04). AIMMeR may help reduce pathologist workload and streamline diagnostics in CRC.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (171KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making is a crucial aspect of health care, involving the balanced integration of scientific evidence, clinical judgment, ethical considerations, and patient involvement. This process is dynamic and multifaceted, relying on cliniciansâ knowledge, experience, and intuitive understanding to achieve optimal patient outcomes through informed, evidence-based choices. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a revolutionary opportunity in clinical decision-making. AIâs advanced data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities can significantly enhance the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing vast medical data to identify patterns, tailor treatments, predict disease progression, and aid in proactive patient management. However, the incorporation of AI into clinical decision-making raises concerns regarding the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated insights. To address these concerns, 11 âverification paradigmsâ are proposed in this paper, with each paradigm being a unique method to verify the evidence-based nature of AI in clinical decision-making. This paper also frames the concept of âclinically explainable, fair, and responsible, clinician-, expert-, and patient-in-the-loop AI.â This model focuses on ensuring AIâs comprehensibility, collaborative nature, and ethical grounding, advocating for AI to serve as an augmentative tool, with its decision-making processes being transparent and understandable to clinicians and patients. The integration of AI should enhance, not replace, the clinicianâs judgment and should involve continuous learning and adaptation based on real-world outcomes and ethical and legal compliance. In conclusion, while generative AI holds immense promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, it is essential to ensure that it produces evidence-based, reliable, and impactful knowledge. Using the outlined paradigms and approaches can help the medical and patient communities harness AIâs potential while maintaining high patient care standards.",

They used a two-step reading process: (1) without AI support; and (2) with AI support providing additional images with AI overlays. Suspicion of four suspected pathologies (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, consolidations suspicious for pneumonia, and nodules) was reported on a five-point confidence scale. Confidence scores of the board-certified radiologists were converted into four binary reference standards of different sensitivities. Performance by radiology residents and NRRs without AI support/with AI support were statistically compared by using receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs), Youden statistics, and operating point metrics derived from fitted ROC curves.\nResults\nNRRs could significantly improve performance, sensitivity, and accuracy with AI support in all four pathologies tested. In the most sensitive reference standard (reference standard IV), NRR consensus improved the area under the ROC curve (mean, 95% CI) in the detection of the time-critical pathology pneumothorax from 0.846 (0.785-0.907) without AI support to 0.974 (0.947-1.000) with AI support (P < .001), which represented a gain of 30% in sensitivity and 2% in accuracy (while maintaining an optimized specificity). The most pronounced effect was observed in nodule detection, with NRR with AI support improving sensitivity by 53% and accuracy by 7% (area under the ROC curve without AI support, 0.723 [0.661-0.785]; with AI support, 0.890 [0.848-0.931]; P < .001). Radiology residents had smaller, mostly nonsignificant gains in performance, sensitivity, and accuracy with AI support.\nInterpretation\nWe found that in an emergency unit setting without 24/7 radiology coverage, the presented AI solution features an excellent clinical support tool to nonradiologists, similar to a second reader, and allows for a more accurate primary diagnosis and thus earlier therapy initiation.",

Modern technology-driven SPP promotes personalized product design and manufacturing suited to support environmentally friendly products for the circular economy. In this study, we develop a framework pertaining to the interlinks between SPP, big data analytics, machine learning, and the circular economy. To test our framework, we apply structure equation modeling based on data collected from more than 200 automotive industry professionals operating in China. Our results demonstrate that SPP and big data analytics are the central determinants for manufacturing environmentally friendly products, ultimately promoting circular economy applications. SPP plays a pivotal role in innovative product design and in facilitating the relevant manufacturing procedures. Big data analytics significantly feed into SPP applications. Machine learning and flexibility in SPP perform moderating roles in strengthening environmentally friendly outcomes. The mediating role played by SPP between big data analytics and environmentally friendly products for the circular economy is partially encouraging. As SPP powered by AI and Generative AI is an emerging phenomenon, our study contributes to this new knowledge dimension. We conclude this paper by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our study, its limitations, and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, potentially leading to substantial advancements such as improved diagnostics, has been of increasing scientific and societal interest in recent years. However, the use of AI raises new ethical challenges, such as an increased risk of bias and potential discrimination against patients, as well as misdiagnoses potentially leading to over- or underdiagnosis with substantial consequences for patients. Recognizing these challenges, current research underscores the importance of integrating AI ethics into medical education. This viewpoint paper aims to introduce a comprehensive set of ethical principles for teaching AI ethics in medical education. This dynamic and principle-based approach is designed to be adaptive and comprehensive, addressing not only the current but also emerging ethical challenges associated with the use of AI in medicine. This study conducts a theoretical analysis of the current academic discourse on AI ethics in medical education, identifying potential gaps and limitations. The inherent interconnectivity and interdisciplinary nature of these anticipated challenges are illustrated through a focused discussion on âinformed consentâ in the context of AI in medicine and medical education. This paper proposes a principle-based approach to AI ethics education, building on the 4 principles of medical ethicsâautonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justiceâand extending them by integrating 3 public health ethics principlesâefficiency, common good orientation, and proportionality. The principle-based approach to teaching AI ethics in medical education proposed in this study offers a foundational framework for addressing the anticipated ethical challenges of using AI in medicine, recommended in the current academic discourse. By incorporating the 3 principles of public health ethics, this principle-based approach ensures that medical ethics education remains relevant and responsive to the dynamic landscape of AI integration in medicine. As the advancement of AI technologies in medicine is expected to increase, medical ethics education must adapt and evolve accordingly. The proposed principle-based approach for teaching AI ethics in medical education provides an important foundation to ensure that future medical professionals are not only aware of the ethical dimensions of AI in medicine but also equipped to make informed ethical decisions in their practice. Future research is required to develop problem-based and competency-oriented learning objectives and educational content for the proposed principle-based approach to teaching AI ethics in medical education.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is structuralizing social, political, and economic determinants of health into the invisible algorithms that shape all facets of modern life. Nevertheless, AI holds immense potential as a public health tool, enabling beneficial objectives such as precision public health and medicine. Developing an AI governance framework that can maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of AI is a significant challenge. The benefits of public health engagement in AI governance could be extensive. Here, we describe how several public health concepts can enhance AI governance. Specifically, we explain how (1) harm reduction can provide a framework for navigating the governance debate between traditional regulation and âsoft lawâ approaches; (2) a public health understanding of social determinants of health is crucial to optimally weigh the potential risks and benefits of AI; (3) public health ethics provides a toolset for guiding governance decisions where individual interests intersect with collective interests; and (4) a One Health approach can improve AI governance effectiveness while advancing public health outcomes. Public health theories, perspectives, and innovations could substantially enrich and improve AI governance, creating a more equitable and socially beneficial path for AI development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates how postsecondary learners employ generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, to support their self-directed learning (SDL) for writing purposes. Following a sequential mixed methods design, we analyzed 384 survey responses and 10 semi-structured interviews with postsecondary writers. Findings suggest that the major learning task that the learners used ChatGPT for writing is brainstorming and seeking inspiration for ideas. While the entering motivation for using ChatGPT varies from curiosity about innovative technologies to fulfilling academic requirements, such entering motivation transformed into task motivation when the learners perceived the potential benefits of ChatGPT for assisting their writing. In terms of self-management, participants mostly demonstrated a high responsibility towards their own learning with ChatGPT and employed various strategies for SDL. Although survey respondents demonstrated a comparatively low level of self-monitoring, most interviewees claimed that they critically reflected on their learning process and validated information provided by ChatGPT. There are mixed opinions regarding whether the writing skills have improved as a result of using ChatGPT. Some participants suggested that the benefits brought by ChatGPT, such as alleviating social pressure and receiving instant feedback at any time, encouraged them to spend more time practicing writing and making revisions. However, some argue that assessing their AI-assisted SDL learning progress in the short term is challenging. This study addresses gaps in the existing literature where there is scarce, large-scale empirical research on self-directed AI usage in writing, shedding light on the emerging phenomenon of utilizing generative AI as a means of SDL in writing.",

Many EPC companies and their clients have realized the benefits of applying AI to their businesses in order to reduce manual work, drive productivity, and streamline future operations of engineered installations in a highly competitive industry. The current AI market offers various solutions and services to support this industry, but organizations must understand how to acquire AI technology in the most beneficial way based on their business strategy and available resources. This paper presents a framework for EPC companies in their transformation towards AI. Our work is based on examples of project execution of AI-based products development at one of the biggest EPC contractors worldwide and on insights from EPC vendor companies already integrating AI into their engineering solutions. The paper covers the entire life cycle of building AI solutions, from initial business understanding to deployment and further evolution. The framework identifies how various factors influence the choice of approach toward AI project development within large international engineering corporations. By presenting a practical guide for optimal approach selection, this paper contributes to the research in AI project management and organizational strategies for integrating AI technology into businesses. The framework might also help engineering companies choose the optimum AI approach to create business value.",

A key focus is on Generative AI, a growing topic of discussion in the AI domain. However, a common definition for Generative AI within the context of manufacturing systems is lacking. This paper seeks to establish a clear definition for Generative AI in manufacturing systems, and subsequently structures potential application fields and objectives within a GenAI reference framework. In this context, a framework is proposed to characterize use cases within manufacturing systems, providing crucial guidance for manufacturers looking to leverage Generative AI. The theoretical background explores the definition of manufacturing systems and the intersection between data analytics and AI. Furthermore, the paper discusses varying definitions of Generative AI, and derives a definition suitable for manufacturing systems.",

AI-CAC took on average 21 s per CAC scan. We used the 5-year outcomes data for incident atrial fibrillation (AF) and assessed discrimination using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of AI-CAC LA volume with known predictors of AF, the CHARGE-AF Risk Score and NT-proBNP. The mean follow-up time to an AF event was 2.9 Â± 1.4 years.\nResults\nAt 1,2,3,4, and 5 years follow-up 36, 77, 123, 182, and 236 cases of AF were identified, respectively. The AUC for AI-CAC LA volume was significantly higher than CHARGE-AF for Years 1, 2, and 3 (0.83 vs. 0.74, 0.84 vs. 0.80, and 0.81 vs. 0.78, respectively, all p < 0.05), but similar for Years 4 and 5, and significantly higher than NT-proBNP at Years 1â5 (all p < 0.01), but not for combined CHARGE-AF and NT-proBNP at any year. AI-CAC LA significantly improved the continuous Net Reclassification Index for prediction of AF over years 1â5 when added to CHARGE-AF Risk Score (0.60, 0.28, 0.32, 0.19, 0.24), and NT-proBNP (0.68, 0.44, 0.42, 0.30, 0.37) (all p < 0.01).\nConclusion\nAI-CAC LA volume enabled prediction of AF as early as one year and significantly improved on risk classification of CHARGE-AF Risk Score and NT-proBNP.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nHenn na Cafe showcases dynamic human-robot collaboration in customer service.\nâ¢\nHenn na Cafe highlights robots' efficiency and irreplaceable human contributions.\nâ¢\nAI integration in HRI-C could elevate bidirectional interactions at Henn na Cafe.\nâ¢\nCultural context matters: success of tech in service depends on social acceptance.\nâ¢\nResearch recommends cross-cultural studies and longitudinal analyses.\nAbstract\nThroughout history, interactions between humans and robots, and robots themselves have experienced profound shifts, generating a plethora of literature within the domains of manufacturing and services. Despite the abundance of scientific publications, consensus regarding these relationships remains elusive, fostering ambiguity within and between these domains. This article aims to present an encompassing and widely accepted perspective on the existing body of literature, seeking to unravel the nature of these relational paradigms. Our objective revolves around analyzing that zeroes in on the enhancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Human-Robot relationships, particularly in the context of services. Henceforth, our research pivots toward a specialized body of literature exploring the domain of technical-biosocial systems, which encompasses human-technology-social structures. By doing so, we aim to analyze AI within a more delimited context, thereby mitigating the critique that a gap persists in scholarly discourse owing to the predominant analysis of AI within a global purview. Mindful of the potential drawbacks associated with a purely holistic and aggregated conceptual theoretical model, we have opted to subject our model to empirical validation. To achieve this, a case study was employed, with a specific focus on the avant-garde Henn na Cafe in Japan. The findings underline that currently, Henn na Cafe employs Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration (HRI-C). However, there is an expectation that service companies will embrace an evolving HRI-C by integrating AI to enhance service delivery activities. Alternatively, they may opt for a Robot-Robot Interaction and Collaboration (RRI-C) approach with improved social capabilities or multi-human/multi-robot systems. The empirical findings are consistent with existing literature, which indicates a contemporary scholarly interest in investigating complex and emotional systems within service-oriented environments. These environments, characterized by elevated levels of AI, present challenges for AI systems in executing service functions effectively. Recent research endeavors aim to synthesize and assess the prevailing understanding and research directions within this domain. This convergence of findings not only reinforces theoretical research but also provides supplementary perspectives on human-robot relations and the complexities involved in service delivery within technologically sophisticated settings. Subsequent research endeavors could pivot towards a heightened focus on the services sector, exploring potential relationships and how AI might either fortify the services domain or pivot towards a vantage point centered on multi-robot systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman-computer interaction (HCI) research is facing a vital question of the effectiveness of personas generated using artificial intelligence (AI). Addressing this question, this research explores user perceptions of AI-generated personas for textual content (GPT-4) and two image generation models (DALL-E and Midjourney). We evaluate whether the inclusion of images in AI-generated personas impacts user perception or if AI text descriptions alone suffice to create good personas. Recruiting 216 participants, we compare three AI-generated personas without images and those with either DALL-E or Midjourney-created images. Contrary to expectations from persona literature, the presence of images in AI-generated personas did not significantly impact user perceptions. Rather, the participants generally perceived AI-generated personas to be of good quality regardless of the inclusion of images. These findings suggest that textual content, i.e., the persona narrative, is the primary driver of user perceptions in AI-generated personas. Our findings contribute to the ongoing AI-HCI discourse and provide recommendations for designing AI-generated personas.",

This study aimed to examine the interplay between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning competency, and Artificial Intelligence writing by cross-lagged model, with the focus on the moderating role of self-directed learning competency on critical thinking skills and Artificial Intelligence writing. A total of 204 participants completed a critical thinking test, self-directed learning questionnaire and a writing task. The results revealed significant correlations between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning competence, and AI-assisted writing. However, the temporal correlations between critical thinking skills and self-directed learning exhibited a reciprocal pattern over three times, while the correlations between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning, and AI-assisted writing were unidirectional. Interestingly, the findings indicated that self-directed learning moderated the relationship between critical thinking skills and AI-assisted writing over two times, but not in the third time. These findings emphasized the pivotal roles of critical thinking skills and self-directed learning in AI-assisted writing among EFL learners. They also suggested that using AI-assisted tools critically and independently in writing can mitigate the tendency to over-rely on these tools.",

As scientists and engineers adopt deep learning, it is important to consider what effect widespread deployment would have on scientific progress and, ultimately, economic growth. We assess this impact by estimating the idea production function for AI in two computer vision tasks that are considered key test-beds for deep learning and show that AI idea production is notably more capital-intensive than traditional R&D. Because increasing the capital-intensity of R&D accelerates the investments that make scientists and engineers more productive, our work suggests that AI-augmented R&D has the potential to speed up technological change and economic growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe development of generative AI has led to novel ways that technology can be integrated into creative activities. However, this has also raised concerns about how human creators will be affected, and what impact it may have on creative industries. As a result, there has been research into how we can design AI tools that work with human creators, rather than replacing them. In this paper we review approaches utilized to build AI tools that facilitate human creativity and allow users to engage fully and authentically in the creative process. These include leveraging AI models to help us shed light on elements of the creative process, building interfaces that encourage exploration of ideas, and designing technological affordances that can support the development of new creative practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDue to the emergence of AI systems that interact with the physical environment, there is an increased interest in incorporating physical reasoning capabilities into those AI systems. But is it enough to only have physical reasoning capabilities to operate in a real physical environment? In the real world, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As humans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations. Similarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of novelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment. To facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new benchmark, NovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the presence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The benchmark consists of tasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical scenarios. To create tasks in the benchmark, we develop eight novelties representing a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly encountered scenarios in a physical environment, related to applying forces and motions such as rolling, falling, and sliding of objects. According to our benchmark design, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty when it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a physical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a thorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents. Our evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents' performance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform significantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to novelties typically adapt slower than humans. We promote the development of intelligent agents capable of performing at the human level or above when operating in open-world physical environments.

In order to find out about public perception and acceptance of AI-based mental health assessment tools. One hundred and thirty participants responded to the survey, however only 107 of them passed the data quality check. from the 107 respondents, 61.7 % of them are males, and 38.3% of them are females, and 88% of the respondents are in the age range of 18-29 with the last level of education around high school and undergraduate. Using the score of 1-5, Most were familiar with AI, but over two-thirds hadn't used AI in mental health. They weakly believed in AI effectiveness (mean score: 3.08) and doubted it could match traditional methods (mean score: 2.88). Nearly 80% saw AI as helpful for early detection and intervention; 54.2% found current AI credible. Comfort with AI tools was moderate (score: 3.12), but confidence in AI vs. professional assessments was low (score: 2.78). Trust in AI tools is expected to grow in 10 years, with nearly 80% expecting widespread use and higher comfort (score: 3.64). AI is seen as beneficial for increasing mental health service use (score: 3.77) and improving access for underserved populations (70.1%). Privacy and security concerns were high (72.9%). Overall, the public sees AI-based mental health tools positively but still prefers human experts. The level of trust is expected to grow as technology progresses. Privacy concerns need addressing, but overall, acceptance is high.",

This study aimed to examine the interplay between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning competency, and Artificial Intelligence writing by cross-lagged model, with the focus on the moderating role of self-directed learning competency on critical thinking skills and Artificial Intelligence writing. A total of 204 participants completed a critical thinking test, self-directed learning questionnaire and a writing task. The results revealed significant correlations between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning competence, and AI-assisted writing. However, the temporal correlations between critical thinking skills and self-directed learning exhibited a reciprocal pattern over three times, while the correlations between critical thinking skills, self-directed learning, and AI-assisted writing were unidirectional. Interestingly, the findings indicated that self-directed learning moderated the relationship between critical thinking skills and AI-assisted writing over two times, but not in the third time. These findings emphasized the pivotal roles of critical thinking skills and self-directed learning in AI-assisted writing among EFL learners. They also suggested that using AI-assisted tools critically and independently in writing can mitigate the tendency to over-rely on these tools.",

When tested on unseen cell lines, performance dropped sharply. Additionally, despite high mechanisms of action prediction accuracy, most feature correlations are low, raising concerns about the trustworthiness of these algorithms.\nAbstract\nCell imaging assays utilising fluorescence stains are essential for observing sub-cellular organelles and their responses to perturbations. Immunofluorescent staining process is routinely in labs, however the recent innovations in generative AI is challenging the idea of wet lab immunofluorescence (IF) staining. This is especially true when the availability and cost of specific fluorescence dyes is a problem to some labs. Furthermore, staining process takes time and leads to interâintra-technician and hinders downstream image and data analysis, and the reusability of image data for other projects. Recent studies showed the use of generated synthetic IF images from brightfield (BF) images using generative AI algorithms in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we benchmark and compare five models from three types of IF generation backbonesâCNN, GAN, and diffusion modelsâusing a publicly available dataset. This paper not only serves as a comparative study to determine the best-performing model but also proposes a comprehensive analysis pipeline for evaluating the efficacy of generators in IF image synthesis. We highlighted the potential of deep learning-based generators for IF image synthesis, while also discussed potential issues and future research directions. Although generative AI shows promise in simplifying cell phenotyping using only BF images with IF staining, further research and validations are needed to address the key challenges of model generalisability, batch effects, feature relevance and computational costs.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (304KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Indeed, accurate RUL prediction is challenging, primarily because of the complex nature of the work and dynamic shifts in model parameters. To address these challenges, this article comprehensively explores five significant publicly accessible lithium-ion battery datasets, encompassing diverse usage conditions and battery types, offering researchers a rich repository of experimental data. In particular, we not only provide detailed information and access addresses for each dataset, but also present, for the first time, four innovative methods for battery aging health factor extraction. These methods, based on advanced AI techniques, are able to effectively identify and quantify key indicators of battery performance degradation, thereby enhancing the precision and dependability of RUL prediction. Additionally, the article identifies major challenges faced by current predictive techniques, including data quality, model generalization capabilities, and computational cost, highlighting the need for research focused on dataset diversity, multiple algorithm fusion, and hybrid physical-data-driven models to enhance prediction accuracy. We believe that this review will help researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of RUL estimation methods and promote the development of AI in battery.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (309KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Background\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted various sectors, with health care witnessing some of its most groundbreaking contributions. Contemporary models, such as ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Bing, have showcased capabilities beyond just generating text, aiding in complex tasks like literature searches and refining web-based queries.\nObjective\nThis study explores a compelling query: can AI author an academic paper independently? Our assessment focuses on four core dimensions: relevance (to ensure that AIâs response directly addresses the prompt), accuracy (to ascertain that AIâs information is both factually correct and current), clarity (to examine AIâs ability to present coherent and logical ideas), and tone and style (to evaluate whether AI can align with the formality expected in academic writings). Additionally, we will consider the ethical implications and practicality of integrating AI into academic writing.\nMethods\nTo assess the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Bing in the context of academic paper assistance in general practice, we used a systematic approach. ChatGPT-4, an advanced AI language model by Open AI, excels in generating human-like text and adapting responses based on user interactions, though it has a knowledge cut-off in September 2021. Microsoft Bing's AI chatbot facilitates user navigation on the Bing search engine, offering tailored search\nResults\nIn terms of relevance, ChatGPT-4 delved deeply into AIâs health care role, citing academic sources and discussing diverse applications and concerns, while Microsoft Bing provided a concise, less detailed overview. In terms of accuracy, ChatGPT-4 correctly cited 72% (23/32) of its peer-reviewed articles but included some nonexistent references. Microsoft Bingâs accuracy stood at 46% (6/13), supplemented by relevant nonâpeer-reviewed articles. In terms of clarity, both models conveyed clear, coherent text. ChatGPT-4 was particularly adept at detailing technical concepts, while Microsoft Bing was more general. In terms of tone, both models maintained an academic tone, but ChatGPT-4 exhibited superior depth and breadth in content delivery.\nConclusions\nComparing ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Bing for academic assistance revealed strengths and limitations. ChatGPT-4 excels in depth and relevance but falters in citation accuracy. Microsoft Bing is concise but lacks robust detail. Though both models have potential, neither can independently handle comprehensive academic tasks. As AI evolves, combining ChatGPT-4âs depth with Microsoft Bingâs up-to-date referencing could optimize academic support. Researchers should critically assess AI outputs to maintain academic credibility.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\ngeneration of bioactive and drug-like hit molecules is a pivotal goal in computer-aided drug discovery. While artificial intelligence (AI) has proven adept at generating molecules with desired chemical properties, previous studies often overlook the influence of disease-specific cellular environments. This study introduces GxVAEs, a novel AI-driven deep generative model designed to produce hit molecules from transcriptome profiles using dual variational autoencoders (VAEs). The first VAE, ProfileVAE, extracts latent features from transcriptome profiles to guide the second VAE, MolVAE, in generating hit molecules. GxVAEs aim to bridge the gap between molecule generation and the biological context of disease, producing molecules that are biologically relevant within specific cellular environments or pathological conditions. Experimental results and case studies focused on hit molecule generation demonstrate that GxVAEs surpass current state-of-the-art methods, in terms of reproducibility of known ligands. This approach is expected to effectively find potential molecular structures with bioactivities across diverse disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study explored the relationship between the leadership styles adopted by academic librarians and their openness to artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose was to discern whether particular leadership approaches influence librarians' attitudes and acceptance of AI technologies in higher education. Data was collected from 50 librarians across four Arab countries. Two distinct questionnaires were administered to the participants: the first focused on their perceptions of AI, exploring attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of AI technologies, while the second implemented the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5Ã) to assess the librarians' leadership styles. Correlational analysis, inferential statistics including structural equation model, and regression analysis were employed leading to explore the predictive power of various leadership styles on librarians' openness to AI. Findings suggest that the implementation of AI in academic libraries is most likely to occur under transformational leadership, with transactional leadership being associated with suboptimal outcomes; a noteworthy association is observed between the perception of ease of use and the adoption of laissez-faire leadership. The insights derived from this study hold particular significance for the development of librarians' professional training programs, offering valuable guidance on fostering adaptive leadership strategies that align with the evolving landscape of AI integration within academic library settings.",

Previous research has shown that people generally have difficulty distinguishing AI-generated from human-written texts; however, the ability of teachers to identify an AI-generated text among student essays has not yet been investigated. Here we show in two experimental studies that novice (N = 89) and experienced teachers (N = 200) could not identify texts generated by ChatGPT among student-written texts. However, there are some indications that more experienced teachers made more differentiated and more accurate judgments. Furthermore, both groups were overconfident in their judgments. Effects of real and assumed source on quality assessment were heterogeneous. Our findings demonstrate that with relatively little prompting, current AI can generate texts that are not detectable for teachers, which poses a challenge to schools and universities in grading student essays. Our study provides empirical evidence for the current debate regarding exam strategies in schools and universities in light of the latest technological developments.",

In this paper, we focus on how humans learn from uncertainty while performing a high uncertainty task with AI systems. We analyze Tesla's autonomous driving systems (ADS), a type of AI system, drawing on crash investigation reports, published reports on formal simulation tests and YouTube recordings of informal simulation tests by amateur drivers. Our empirical analysis provides insights into how varied levels of uncertainty tolerance have implications for how humans learn from uncertainty in real-time and over time to jointly perform the driving task with Tesla's ADS. Our core contribution is a theoretical model that explains human-AI joint task performance. Specifically, we show that, the interdependencies between different modes of AI use including uncontrolled automation, limited automation, expanded automation, and controlled automation are dynamically shaped through humans' learning from uncertainty. We discuss how humans move between these modes of AI use by increasing, reducing, or reinforcing their uncertainty tolerance. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of AI systems, policy into delegation in joint task performance, as well as the use of data to improve learning from uncertainty.",

The research leverages Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network models to predict the accumulated net primary productivity (NPP) of various crops, i.e., single rice, double rice, maize, and wheat, in Jianghan Plain. The models highlight a strong predictive performance, with the SE model achieving an R2 of 0.83 and wheat model an R2 of 0.90, implying these models can be utilized reliably for future NPP forecasting. Our evaluation of past and future NPP values reveals a negative correlation between the increase in NPP values and observed temperature trends. This emphasizes the significant impact of temperature on crop bioenergy potential. For future NPP predictions, scenario (S3a) under Temperature Control strategies at medium-effort mitigation yields a favourable outcome for all crops, particularly SE. Additionally, the results suggest that aggressive decarbonization and global warming mitigation strategies are vital for enhancing NPP values. However, the study also highlights potential trade-offs and stresses the necessity for region-specific climate reconciliation strategies; for instance, midland counties benefit from temperature control, whereas the sideline favours CO2 mitigation. The study further investigates the spatial distribution of potential bioenergy, with the southwestern part of the plain holding more bioenergy potential, providing an essential reference for future energy planning. By 2030, in Jianghan Plain, when fully integrated with reasonable climate responses, there could be substantial bioenergy potential from crop residues reaching (1.2â1.9) Ã 109 MJ, which is 11% less than the current.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (644KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, many organizations â especially those in more traditional industries â struggle to seize these opportunities. To unpack the underlying reasons, we investigate how more traditional industries implement predictive maintenance, a promising application of AI in manufacturing organizations. For our analysis, we employ a multiple-case design and adopt a critical realist perspective to identify generative mechanisms of AI implementation. Overall, we find five interdependent mechanisms: experimentation; knowledge building and integration; data; anxiety; and inspiration. Using causal loop diagramming, we flesh out the socio-technical dynamics of these mechanisms and explore the organizational requirements of implementing AI. The resulting topology of generative mechanisms contributes to the research on AI management by offering rich insights into the cause-effect relationships that shape the implementation process. Moreover, it demonstrates how causal loop diagraming can improve the modeling and analysis of generative mechanisms.",

The Modality category encompasses areas such as the degree of AI being interactive, informational versus actualizing, or autonomous. The Person variable contains variables such as age, gender, personality, technological self-efficacy, and perceived competence when interacting with AI, whereas the Area variable can comprise a certain product where AI is in-built or a certain domain where AI is used to make a difference (such as the health sector, military sector, education sector, etc.). The Culture variable is of importance to understand because cultural settings might shape attitudes towards AI. Finally, this might also be true for transparent AI (or understandable/explainable AI), with high degrees of transparency likely to elicit trust.\nThe proposed model suggests that there is no easy answer when one seeks to understand the impact of AI on the world and humans. Only by considering a myriad number of variables in a model, summed up in the acronym IMPACT (Interaction/Interplay of Modality-Person-Area-Culture-Transparency), we might get closer to an understanding of how AI impacts individualsâ well-being.",

Accordingly, researchers and practitioners advocate overcoming these concerns by refining AI interfaces in terms of tangibility, immediacy, and transparency. However, AI video interviews featuring different interfaces may impact interviewees' tendencies to engage in impression management behaviors (IMs), which can either improve or impair personnel selection validity. This study addressed calls for research to investigate the issues mentioned above by conducting a field study to explore the ways in which AI and AI interfaces affect candidates' IMs in asynchronous video interviews (AVIs). We developed three AVI interfaces and measured real job applicants' self-reported IMs across four experimental treatments. We found that different AI interfaces could increase or decrease candidates' honest IMs and deceptive IMs in different ways. An exploratory analysis also found that candidates' interview anxiety could be mitigated by an AI interface.",

Such simulations in turn allow us to validate and even revise experimental results, deepen our understanding of the physicochemical processes in nature, and design better materials, devices, and drugs.

AI providers seeking to promote and perpetuate the use of this technology are faced with the complex reality of embedding AI-enabled diagnostics across variable implementation contexts. In this study, we draw upon a complexity science approach and qualitative methodology to understand how AI providers perceive and navigate the spread of AI in complex healthcare systems. Using semi-structured, one-to-one interviews, we collected qualitative data from 14 providers of AI-enabled diagnostics. We triangulated the data by complementing the interviews with multiple sources, including a focus group of physicians with experience using these technologies. The notion of embedding allowed us to connect local implementation efforts with systemic diffusion. Our study reveals that AI providers self-organise to increase their adaptability when navigating the variable conditions and unpredictability of complex healthcare contexts. In addition to the tensions perceived by AI providers within the sociocultural, technological, and institutional subsystems of healthcare, we illustrate the practices emerging among them to mitigate these tensions: stealth science, agility, and digital ambidexterity. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on the spread of AI in healthcare by capturing the view of technology providers and adding a new theoretical perspective through the lens of complexity science.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPollen grains play a critical role in environmental, agricultural, and allergy research despite their tiny dimensions. The accurate classification of pollen grains remains a significant challenge, mainly attributable to their intricate structures and the extensive diversity of species. Traditional methods often lack accuracy and effectiveness, prompting the need for advanced solutions. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework, PollenNet, designed to tackle the intricate challenge of pollen grain image classification. The efficiency of PollenNet is thoroughly evaluated through stratified 5-fold cross-validation, comparing it with cutting-edge methods to demonstrate its superior performance. A comprehensive data preparation phase is conducted, including removing duplicates and low-quality images, applying Non-local Means Denoising for noise reduction, and Gamma correction to adjust image brightness. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) is utilized to enhance the interpretability of the model, while Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis serves as a quantitative method for evaluating the model's capabilities. PollenNet demonstrates superior performance when compared to existing models, with an accuracy of 98.45 %, precision of 98.20 %, specificity of 98.40 %, recall of 98.30 %, and f1-score of 98.25 %. The model also maintains low Mean Squared Error (0.03) and Mean Absolute Error (0.02) rates. The ROC curve analysis, the low False Positive Rate (0.016), and the False Negative Rate (0.017) highlight the reliability and dependability of the model. This study significantly improves the efficacy of classifying pollen grains, indicating an important advancement in the application of deep learning for ecological research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently, many generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are being integrated into the educational technology landscape for instructors. Our paper examines the potential and challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to code student-generated content in online discussions based on intended learning outcomes and how instructors could use this to assess the intended and enacted learning design. If instructors were to rely on LLMs as a means of assessment, the reliability of these models to code the data accurately is crucial. Employing a diverse set of LLMs from the GPT family and prompting techniques on an asynchronous online discussion dataset from a blended-learning bachelor-level course, our research examines the reliability of AI-supported coding in educational research. Findings reveal that while AI-supported coding demonstrates efficiency, achieving substantial, moderate agreement with human coding for specific nuanced and context-dependent codes is challenging. Moreover, the high cost, token limits, and the advanced necessary skills needed to write API scripts might limit the usability of AI-driven coding. Finally, implementation would require specific parameterization techniques based on the class and may not be feasible for widespread implementation. Our study underscores the importance of transparency in AI coding methodologies and the need for a hybrid approach that integrates human judgement to ensure data accuracy and interpretability. In addition, it contributes to the knowledge base about the reliability of LLMs to code real, small datasets using complex codes that are common in the instructor's practice and explores the potential and challenges of using these models for assessment purposes.",

Although use of IMUs is useful to understand some intrinsic PD fall-risk factors, their use alone is limited as they do not provide information on extrinsic factors (e.g., obstacles). Here, we update on the use of ergonomic wearable video-based eye-tracking glasses coupled with AI-based computer vision methodologies to provide information efficiently and ethically in free-living home-based environments to better understand IMU-based data in a small group of people with PD. The use of video and AI within PD research can be seen as an evolutionary step to improve methods to understand fall risk more comprehensively.",

This study investigates whether a human (Target) can introspect and enhance their knowledge and thoughts by visualizing the knowledge accumulated in their digital twin AI (Agent) within the \"outer loop\" of the Human-AI-Collaboration SECI Model (HAC-SECI Model), developed based on the SECI model of knowledge transmission. Specifically, the expert (Target) and his digital twin AI (Agent) respond to three sets of questions, and the differences in their responses are analyzed to determine their contribution to Targetâs self-reflection and evolution. Through this case study, the proposed model contributes to human development through dialogue with AI.",

    "abstract": "As advances in artificial intelligence (AI) continue to transform and revolutionize the field of medicine, understanding the potential uses of generative AI in health care becomes increasingly important. Generative AI, including models such as generative adversarial networks and large language models, shows promise in transforming medical diagnostics, research, treatment planning, and patient care. However, these data-intensive systems pose new threats to protected health information. This Viewpoint paper aims to explore various categories of generative AI in health care, including medical diagnostics, drug discovery, virtual health assistants, medical research, and clinical decision support, while identifying security and privacy threats within each phase of the life cycle of such systems (ie, data collection, model development, and implementation phases). The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care, this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics, security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition, this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt generative AI solutions within their organizations.",

While the prevailing view is that these technologies generally have a positive effect on student learning, their impact on studentsâ agency and ability to self-regulate their learning is under-explored. Do students learn from the regular, detailed and personalised feedback provided by AI systems, and will they continue to exhibit similar behaviour in the absence of assistance? Or do they instead continue to rely on AI assistance without learning from it? To contribute to filling this research gap, we conducted a randomised controlled experiment that explored the impact of AI assistance on student agency in the context of peer feedback. With 1625 students across 10 courses, an experiment was conducted using peer review. During the initial four-week period, students were guided by AI features that utilised techniques such as rule-based suggestion detection, semantic similarity, and comparison with previous comments made by the reviewer to enhance their submissions if the feedback provided was deemed insufficiently detailed or general in nature. Over the following four weeks, students were divided into four different groups: control (AI) received prompts, (NR) received no prompts, (SR) received self-monitoring checklists in place of AI prompts, and (SAI) had access to both AI prompts and self-monitoring checklists. Results of the experiment suggest that students tended to rely on rather than learn from AI assistance. If AI assistance was removed, self-regulated strategies could help fill the gap but were not as effective as AI assistance. Results also showed that hybrid human-AI approaches that complement AI assistance with self-regulated strategies (SAI) were not more effective than AI assistance on its own. We conclude by discussing the broader benefits, challenges and implications of relying on AI assistance in relation to student agency in a world where we learn, live and work with AI.",

Inspired in part by equity and procedural justice theories and by theories of attitudes towards technologies, we posited that the perception of these attributes of decisions is influenced by the type of explanation offered, which can be input-based, group-based, case-based, or counterfactual. We tested our hypotheses with two studies, each of which involved a pre-registered online survey experiment conducted in December 2022. In both studies, the subjects (N = 1200) were officers in high positions at stock companies registered in Japan, who were presented with a scenario consisting of an algorithmic decision made by a public authority: a ministry's decision to reject a grant application from their company (Study 1) and a tax authority's decision to select their company for an on-site tax inspection (Study 2). The studies revealed that offering the subjects some type of explanation had a positive effect on their attitude towards a decision, to various extents, although the detailed results of the two studies are not robust. These findings call for a nuanced inquiry, both in research and practice, into how to best design explanations of algorithmic decisions from societal and human-centric perspectives in different decision-making contexts.",

Although sign language is one of the oldest and most organic ways to communicate, there aren't many resources available in Nepal to help with the communication gap between Nepali and American Sign Language (ASL). This study investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and AI-driven methods for translating ASL into Nepali text and speech to bridge the technical divide. Two pre-trained transfer learning models, ResNet50 and VGG16, were refined to classify ASL signs using extensive ASL image datasets. The system utilizes the Python gTTS package to translate signs into Nepali text and speech, integrating with an OpenCV video input TKinter-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). With both CNN architectures, the model's accuracy of over 99 % allowed for the smooth conversion of ASL to speech output. By providing a workable solution to improve inclusion and communication, the deployment of an AI-driven translation system represents a significant step in lowering the technological obstacles that disabled people in Nepal must overcome.",

We use decision tree algorithms (J48), random forest and naive bayes, but in a retrospective cross-sectional validation with 10 sample partitions we obtain a poor predictive capacity of only a 51 % success rate in the best of cases.\nTherefore, despite the evident correlation between predictors and the objective variable, we should not implement this investment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAdvancements in uncertain reasoning systems within healthcare are crucial for navigating the complexities of patient data, requiring innovative methodologies that integrate AI interpretation capabilities and robust handling of inherent ambiguity. Healthcare systems face the challenge of handling uncertainty inherent in patient data, necessitating sophisticated decision-making tools like Uncertain Reasoning Systems (URS) for effective ambiguity navigation. Recognizing the complexity of healthcare scenarios, advancements in AI interpretation within URS are crucial beyond traditional methods. Conventional techniques like statistical approaches and rule-based systems often prove inadequate due to their rigid frameworks and limited ability to manage inherent ambiguity. This paper proposes an innovative methodology that integrates Min-Max normalization and robust missing data handling techniques with Hybrid Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems and Neural Networks, supplemented by Game Theory for model refinement. Through the integration of Game Theory, it can dynamically adjust its strategies to healthcare data uncertainties, thereby enhancing its resilience and efficacy. Implemented using Python tools, the proposed system achieves an exceptional 99.4â¯% accuracy, surpassing baseline methods such as FNN (88.1â¯%) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes (90â¯%), highlighting its superior performance in healthcare decision-making. These findings represent significant strides in AI interpretation and decision-making within Uncertain Reasoning Systems, underscoring the practical relevance of the proposed approach.",

Little is known about undergraduate willingness to use AI tools. In this study, psychology undergraduates (N = 160) from the United Kingdom, indicated their willingness to use, and history of using, ChatGPT to write university assignments. Almost a third (32%) indicated that they would use such tools; 15% indicated that they had used them already. Neither personality (conscientiousness, agreeableness, Machiavellianism, narcissism), academic performance, nor study skills self-efficacy could predict future use of AI tools. A novel Degree Apathy Scale was the only significant predictor. Willingness to use AI tools was greater when the risk of getting caught was low, and punishment was light, particularly for those high in degree apathy. Findings suggest that degree apathy is a key risk factor in academic misconduct. Wider research and pedagogical applications of degree apathy are discussed.",

The results reveal that: (1) while the separate applications of YOLO and Hough Transform algorithms achieve building detection rates up to 77% and 83%, respectively, (2) a novel methodology is proposed to combine spatial data and assess their quality of the detected buildings by comparing the generated building polygons with existing cadastral maps. The evaluation uses a polygon-based comparison approach, which computes metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy based on the spatial relationships between predicted and reference building contours, (3) the weighted model showed about 7 % improvement in accuracy compared to cadastral data. This innovative approach substantially improves spatial data processing, aiding in implementing principles for real estate good governance and offering a valuable asset for various land administration applications.",

In fact, the recent development of ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate high-quality communication content at scale and across domains, suggesting that they will be increasingly used in practice. However, many questions remain about how knowing the source of the messages influences recipients' evaluation of and preference for AI-generated messages compared to human-generated messages. This paper investigated this topic in the context of vaping prevention messaging. In Study 1, which was pre-registered, we examined the influence of source disclosure on young adults' evaluation of AI-generated health prevention messages compared to human-generated messages. We found that source disclosure (i.e., labeling the source of a message as AI vs. human) significantly impacted the evaluation of the messages but did not significantly alter message rankings. In a follow-up study (Study 2), we examined how the influence of source disclosure may vary by the adultsâ negative attitudes towards AI. We found a significant moderating effect of negative attitudes towards AI on message evaluation, but not for message selection. However, source disclosure decreased the preference for AI-generated messages for those with moderate levels (statistically significant) and high levels (directional) of negative attitudes towards AI. Overall, the results of this series of studies showed a slight bias against AI-generated messages once the source was disclosed, adding to the emerging area of study that lies at the intersection of AI and communication.",

One significant subset of this work centers on machine learning-based approaches to supporting medical decision-making around COVID-19 diagnosis. To date, various challenges, including IT issues, have meant that, notwithstanding this strand of research on digital diagnosis of COVID-19, the actual use of these methods in medical facilities remains incipient at best, despite their potential to relieve pressure on scarce medical resources, prevent instances of infection, and help manage the difficulties and unpredictabilities surrounding the emergence of new mutations. The reasons behind this research-application gap are manifold and may imply an interdisciplinary dimension. We argue that the discipline of AI ethics can provide a framework for interdisciplinary discussion and create a roadmap for the application of digital COVID-19 diagnosis, taking into account all disciplinary stakeholders involved. This article proposes such an ethical framework for the practical use of digital COVID-19 diagnosis, considering legal, medical, operational managerial, and technological aspects of the issue in accordance with our diverse research backgrounds and noting the potential of the approach we set out here to guide future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMillions of people throughout the world struggle with mental health disorders, but the widespread stigma associated with these issues often prevents them from seeking treatment. We propose a novel strategy that integrates Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), DAG-based hedera technology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to overcome these challenges. We also consider the costs of chronic diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, which often require 24-hour care. Using smart monitoring tools coupled with AI algorithms that can detect early indicators of deterioration, our system aims to provide low-cost, continuous support. Since IoMT data is large in volume, we need a blockchain network with high transaction throughput without compromising the privacy of patient data. To address this concern, we propose to use Hedera technology to ensure the privacy, and security of personal mental health information, scalability and a faster transaction confirmation rate. Overall, this research paper outlines a holistic approach to mental health monitoring that respects privacy, promotes accessibility, and harnesses the potential of emerging technologies. By combining IoMT, Hedera, and AI, we offer a solution that can help break down the barriers that prevent individuals from seeking the support they need for their mental well-being. Furthermore, comparative analysis shows that our best-performing ML models achieve an accuracy of around 98%, which is more than 30% better than traditional models such as logistic regression.",

On Spainâs Mediterranean coast, organic citrus farms face increasing challenges from invasive species like Araujia sericifera and Cortaderia selloana, which further complicate cover crop management. This study introduces a swarm system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with neural networks based on YOLOv10 for the detection and geo-location of these invasive weeds. The system achieves F1-scores of 0.78 for Araujia sericifera and 0.80 for Cortaderia selloana. Using GPS and RTK, the UAVs generate KML files to guide diffuser drones for precise, localized treatments with organic products. By automating the detection, treatment, and elimination of invasive species, the system enhances both productivity and sustainability in organic farming. Additionally, the proposed solution addresses the high labor costs associated with manual weeding by reducing the need for human intervention. A comprehensive economic analysis indicates potential savings ranging from 1810 to 2650 â¬ per hectare, depending on farm size. This innovative approach not only improves weed control efficiency but also promotes environmental sustainability, offering a scalable solution for organic and conventional agriculture alike.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (215KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in manufacturing processes is raising the need of users to understand and interpret the decision-making processes of complex AI systems. Traditional black-box AI models often lack transparency, making it challenging for users to comprehend the reasoning behind their outputs. In contrast, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques provide interpretability by revealing the internal mechanisms of AI models, making them more trustworthy and facilitating human-AI collaboration. In order to promote XAI modelsâ dissemination, this paper proposes a matrix-based methodology to design XAI-driven user interfaces in manufacturing contexts. It helps in mapping the usersâ needs and identifying the âexplainability visualization typesâ that best fits the end usersâ requirements for the specific context of use. The proposed methodology was applied in the XMANAI European Project (https://ai4manufacturing.eu), aimed at creating a novel AI platform to support XAI-supported decision making in manufacturing plants. Results showed that the proposed methodology is able to guide companies in the correct implementation of XAI models, realizing the full potential of AI while ensuring human oversight and control.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of groundbreaking health care innovations has led to the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), thus marking a new frontier that demonstrates the promise of combining the advantages of ancient healing practices with cutting-edge advancements in modern technology. TCM, which is a holistic medical system with >2000 years of empirical support, uses unique diagnostic methods such as inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and palpation. AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially via computer systems. TCM is experience oriented, holistic, and subjective, and its combination with AI has beneficial effects, which presumably arises from the perspectives of diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and prognostic veracity. The role of AI in TCM is highlighted by its use in diagnostics, with machine learning enhancing the precision of treatment through complex pattern recognition. This is exemplified by the greater accuracy of TCM syndrome differentiation via tongue images that are analyzed by AI. However, integrating AI into TCM also presents multifaceted challenges, such as data quality and ethical issues; thus, a unified strategy, such as the use of standardized data sets, is required to improve AI understanding and application of TCM principles. The evolution of TCM through the integration of AI is a key factor for elucidating new horizons in health care. As research continues to evolve, it is imperative that technologists and TCM practitioners collaborate to drive innovative solutions that push the boundaries of medical science and honor the profound legacy of TCM. We can chart a future course wherein AI-augmented TCM practices contribute to more systematic, effective, and accessible health care systems for all individuals.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) recent advancements with multi-spectral satellite imagery have been utilized to enhance lithological mapping in these areas. Here we employed different AI models namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classification (RFC), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) for lithological mapping. This was followed by the application of explainable AI (XAI) for lithological discrimination (LD) which is still not widely explored. Based on the highest accuracy and F1 score of the previously mentioned models, RFC model outperformed all of them, and hence, it was integrated with XAI, using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method.\nThis approach successfully identified critical multi-spectral features for LD in arid crystalline zones when applied on the Landsat-8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and SRTM-DEM datasets covering the Hammash and the Wadi Fatimah areas in Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, respectively. Field validation in the Hammash area confirmed the RFC model's efficacy, achieving a satisfactory 94% overall accuracy for 18 features. SHAP was able to identify the top ten features for proper LD over the Hammash area with 90.3% accuracy despite the complex nature of the ophiolitic mÃ©lange. For validation purposes, RCF was then utilized in the Wadi Fatimah region, using only the top 10 critical features rendered from the SHAP analysis. It performed well and had 93% accuracy. Notably, XAI/SHAP results indicated that elevation data, Landsat-8's Green Band (B3), and the two ASTER SWIR bands (B5 and B6) were essential and significant for identifying island arc rocks. Moreover, the SHAP model effectively delineated complex mÃ©lange matrices, primarily using ASTER SWIR band (B8). Our findings highlight the successful combination of RFC with XAI for LD and its potential utilization in similar arid crystalline environments worldwide.",

Traditional culturing methods require up to 96 h, including 72 h for bacterial growth, identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) through protein profile analysis, and 24 h for antibiotic susceptibility testing. In this study, we aimed at developing an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) by integrating MALDI-TOF MS and machine learning to quickly identify levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance in SM, optimizing treatment decisions.\nMethods\nWe selected 8,662 SM from 165,299 MALDI-TOF MS-analysed bacterial specimens, collected from a major medical centre and four secondary hospitals. We exported mass-to-charge values and intensity spectral profiles from MALDI-TOF MS .mzML files to predict antibiotic susceptibility testing results, obtained with the VITEK-2 system using machine learning algorithms. We optimized the models with GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation.\nResults\nWe identified distinct spectral differences between resistant and susceptible SM strains, demonstrating crucial resistance features. The machine learning models, including random forest, light-gradient boosting machine, and XGBoost, exhibited high accuracy. We established an AI-CDSS to offer healthcare professionals swift, data-driven advice on antibiotic use.\nConclusions\nMALDI-TOF MS and machine learning integration into an AI-CDSS significantly improved rapid SM resistance detection. This system reduced the identification time of resistant strains from 24 h to minutes after MALDI-TOF MS identification, providing timely and data-driven guidance. Combining MALDI-TOF MS with machine learning could enhance clinical decision-making and improve SM infection treatment outcomes.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (108KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Traditional signature-based detection methods have become inefficient and time-consuming. However, data-driven AI techniques, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have shown effectiveness in detecting malware by analyzing behavioral characteristics. Despite their promising performance, the black-box nature of these models requires improved explainability to facilitate their adoption in real-world applications. This can complicate the ability of cybersecurity experts to evaluate the modelâs reliability. In this work, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is employed to comprehend and evaluate the decisions made by machine learning models in the detection of malware on Android devices. To evaluate malware detection, experiments were conducted using CICMalDroid dataset by applying ML models like Logistic Regression and several tree algorithms. An overall 94% F1-score was achieved, and interpretable explanations for model decisions were provided, highlighting more critical features that contributed to accurate classifications. It was found that employing XAI techniques can provide valuable insights for malware analysis researchers, enhancing their understanding of the operations of the ML model, rather than solely focusing on improving accuracy.",

Traditional DL models often lack transparency, leading to skepticism among medical experts owing to their \"black box\" nature. This study addresses this gap by presenting an innovative approach for brain tumor detection. It utilizes a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model empowered by three advanced explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques: Shapley Additive Explana-tions (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The study utilized the BR35H dataset, which includes 3060 brain MRI images encompassing both tumorous and non-tumorous cases. The proposed model achieved a remarkable training accuracy of 100 % and validation accuracy of 98.67 %. Precision, recall, and F1 score metrics demonstrated exceptional performance at 98.50 %, confirming the accuracy of the model in tumor detection. Detailed result analysis, including a confusion matrix, comparison with existing models, and generalizability tests on other datasets, establishes the superiority of the proposed approach and sets a new benchmark for accuracy. By integrating a customized CNN model with XAI techniques, this research enhances trust in AI-driven medical diagnostics and offers a promising pathway for early tumor detection and potentially life-saving interventions.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (257KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of PFAS research trends using a novel approach combining text mining techniques and large-scale language models (LLMs). PFAS-related scientific literature published from 1980 to 2024 was gathered from Scopus, and KH Coder and Claude 3 were used to perform the analysis. The results showed a significant increase in research output and a clear shift in research topics over the past 40 years. Whereas in the past, the focus was on analytical methods, more recently, the emphasis has been on environmental fate, toxicity assessment, alternative compounds, and regulation. With Claude 3, research areas can now be identified without reviewing the results of expert text mining. Comparisons of AI-extracted trends with insights from traditional review articles showed strong agreement, confirming the effectiveness of this approach. These findings suggest the need for continued interdisciplinary research on PFAS such as the development of remediation strategies, elucidation of health effects, and evidence-based policymaking. This study showed the possibility of integrating text mining and LLM for a comprehensive analysis of research trends, which will accelerate future research and development strategies.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (259KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTraffic accidents, a global concern, pose threats to lives and carry substantial economic and societal burdens. This paper explores the innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the ambiance of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to address the challenge. We investigate AI's potential to enhance road safety globally, utilizing data analysis, predictive modeling, and intelligent traffic management systems. Our goal is to revolutionize accident prevention by optimizing decision-making processes and promoting safer and more efficient road environments. In the realm of information aggregation and fusion, growing interest among researchers has centered on probabilistic linguistic expression sets, which adeptly aggregate uncertain data. This article's primary aim is to explore methodologies for aggregating information within a probabilistic linguistic environment. To achieve this goal, we have introduced procedural laws based on the Sugeno-Weber (SW) framework for handling probabilistic linguistic term elements (PLTEs), rooted in both the product and sum of SW operations. Consequently, we have crafted a range of probabilistic linguistic aggregation techniques, encompassing the probabilistic linguistic SW Average (PLSWA) and Geometric (PLSWG), followed by weighted as well as ordered aggregation operators like PLSWWA and PLSWWG, PLSWOWA and PLSWOWG. By harnessing SW Ï-norm and Ï-conorm, we have developed versatile aggregation tools that facilitate information reinforcement. Through the utilization of proposed operators, we have presented strategies for effectively integrating probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTs) in the context of MCDM. We have compared our suggested procedures with the TOPSIS approach and elucidated the diverse features inherent to these operators.",

    "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the proliferation of connected devices has raised security concerns, increasing the risk of intrusions into diverse systems. Despite the convenience and efficiency offered by IoT technology, the growing number of IoT devices escalates the likelihood of attacks, emphasizing the need for robust security tools to automatically detect and explain threats. This paper introduces a deep learning methodology for detecting and classifying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, addressing a significant security concern within IoT environments. An effective procedure of deep transfer learning is applied to utilize deep learning backbones, which is then evaluated on two benchmarking datasets of DDoS attacks in terms of accuracy and time complexity. By leveraging several deep architectures, the study conducts thorough binary and multiclass experiments, each varying in the complexity of classifying attack types and demonstrating real-world scenarios. Additionally, this study employs an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) AI technique to elucidate the contribution of extracted features in the process of attack detection. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving a recall of 99.39% by the XAI bidirectional long short-term memory (XAI-BiLSTM) model.",

The authors execute a comprehensive systematic review of xAI properties, various evaluation metrics, and existing frameworks to assess their utility and relevance. Subsequently, the experimental sections evaluate selected xAI techniques against these metrics, delivering key insights into their practical utility and effectiveness. The findings highlight that the proliferation of metrics enhances the understanding of xAI systems but simultaneously exposes challenges such as metric duplication, inefficacy, and confusion. These issues underscore the pressing need for standardized evaluation frameworks to streamline their application and strengthen their effectiveness, thereby improving the overall utility of xAI in critical domains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn general, agriculture plays a crucial role in human survival as a primary source of food, alongside other sources such as fishing. Unfortunately, global warming and other environmental issues, particularly in less privileged nations, hamper the Agricultural sector. It is estimated that a range of 720 to 811 million individuals experienced food insecurity. Today's agriculture faced significant difficulties and obstacles, as do the surveillance and monitoring systems (climate, energy, water, fields, works, cost, fertilizers, diseases, etc.). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the susceptibilities and insufficiencies inherent in worldwide food systems. Current agricultural practices tend to prioritize productivity and profitability over environmental conservation and long-term sustainability. To establish sustainable agriculture capable of meeting the needs of a projected ten billion people in the next 30 years, substantial structural and automation changes are required. However, these obstacles can be overcome by employing smart technologies and advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agricultural operations. AI is believed to contribute to global sustainability goals in multiple sectors, particularly in the incorporation of renewable energy. It is anticipated that AI will revitalize both existing and new agricultural fields by retrofitting, installing and integrating automatic devices and instruments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most promising and novel applications of AI in the agriculture industry. Furthermore, the role of AI in the transition to sustainability and precision agriculture is investigated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose\nRadiological reporting is transitioning to quantitative analysis, requiring large-scale multi-center validation of biomarkers. A major prerequisite and bottleneck for this task is the voxelwise annotation of image data, which is time-consuming for large cohorts. In this study, we propose an iterative training workflow to support and facilitate such segmentation tasks, specifically for high-resolution thoracic CT data.\nMethods\nOur study included 132 thoracic CT scans from clinical practice, annotated by 13 radiologists. In three iterative training experiments, we aimed to improve and accelerate segmentation of the heart and mediastinum. Each experiment started with manual segmentation of 5â25 CT scans, which served as training data for a nnU-Net. Further iterations incorporated AI pre-segmentation and human correction to improve accuracy, accelerate the annotation process, and reduce human involvement over time.\nResults\nResults showed consistent improvement in AI model quality with each iteration. Resampled datasets improved the Dice similarity coefficients for both the heart (DCS 0.91 [0.88; 0.92]) and the mediastinum (DCS 0.95 [0.94; 0.95]). Our AI models reduced human interaction time by 50 % for heart and 70 % for mediastinum segmentation in the most potent iteration. A model trained on only five datasets achieved satisfactory results (DCS > 0.90).\nConclusions\nThe iterative training workflow provides an efficient method for training AI-based segmentation models in multi-center studies, improving accuracy over time and simultaneously reducing human intervention. Future work will explore the use of fewer initial datasets and additional pre-processing methods to enhance model quality.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (181KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This study aims to empirically test an exploratory framework to identify how human-AI interactions differ when engaged in basic or advanced virtual agent usage contexts. A conceptual framework was developed to examine consumer perceptions of basic and advanced virtual agent usage intentions. Five independent variables of trust in AI, perceived security in AI, perceived AI expertise, comfort in using AI technologies, and need for social presence were explored. Data was collected from 322 respondents and analyzed using multivariate regression. The findings suggest that consumers do not perceive service encounters with virtual agents from a âone size fits allâ approach. Consumers perceive different value-in-use perceptions based on the complexity of the usage contexts. Our results suggest that success in advanced virtual agent encounters may require social presence for robust human-AI interaction. Additionally, this study extends the digital servitization and service robot acceptance model (sRAM) literature by evaluating consumer value-in-use perceptions with empirical evidence.",

As with any technology, intelligence systems come with potential downsides. Despite the efforts to mitigate any negative consequences of AI, businesses and employees continue to confront the dilemmas of adopting AI, so it is essential to explore in detail the rising concerns around such technologies. In this paper, we used a single case study to investigate the dark aspects of AI in a Norwegian energy trading firm. We gathered data through semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Specifically, we interviewed AI managers, traders and developers who have worked on deploying and using AI tools over the last three years. Our aim is to identify the dark side of AI use in trading, how AI trading bots affect the relationship between traders and AI developers and how the firm adjusts to this new reality. The findings indicate that negative or unintended consequences of AI can be grouped into three clusters related to (1) the nature of the work; (2) conflicts and effects; and (3) responsibility. The paper concludes with future research and practical implications that can help organiziations mitigate the negative aspects of AI use.",

This study aimed to evaluate a new use of AI in orthopaedics: content generation for professional medical education. Quality, accuracy, and time were compared between content created by ChatGPT and orthopaedic surgery clinical fellows.\nMethods\nChatGPT and 3 orthopaedic adult reconstruction fellows were tasked with creating educational summaries of 5 total joint arthroplasty-related topics. Responses were evaluated across 5 domains by 4 blinded reviewers from different institutions who are all current or former total joint arthroplasty fellowship directors or national arthroplasty board review course directors.\nResults\nChatGPT created better orthopaedic content than fellows when mean aggregate scores for all 5 topics and domains were compared (P â¤ .001). The only domain in which fellows outperformed ChatGPT was the integration of key points and references (P = .006). ChatGPT outperformed the fellows in response time, averaging 16.6 seconds vs the fellows' 94 minutes per prompt (P = .002).\nConclusions\nWith its efficient and accurate content generation, the current findings underscore ChatGPT's potential as an adjunctive tool to enhance orthopaedic arthroplasty graduate medical education. Future studies are warranted to explore AI's role further and optimize its utility in augmenting the educational development of arthroplasty trainees.",

While fillet color scoring traditionally relies on subjective visual inspection using color reference cards or labor-intensive color measurement using a colorimeter, this study aims to develop a smart handheld device (FilletCam AI, hereafter referred to as âFilletCamâ) for precise and rapid profiling of fish fillet color. FilletCam comprises an imaging sensor integrated with an embedded computing unit for image acquisition. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to streamline data collection, analysis, visualization, compilation, and data sharing with authorized users. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) model was developed and deployed on the edge for region-of-interest (ROI) detection. A single-stage YOLOv8 model was trained on a custom image dataset comprised of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fillet images to detect the fillet and color palette with their respective SalmonFanâ¢ (SF) score on the reference card. Delta E metric was adopted to compare the color of the fillet and reference color shades on the SF card. The SF score corresponding to the lowest Delta E value was assigned to the fillet. The object detection model performed well and achieved a mean average precision (mAP0.5) of 99.5 % and an F1 score of 0.99. The FilletCam-predicted fillet color scores were compared with the expert ratings and colorimeter scores to evaluate the performance of the developed tool. The minimum Delta E values for FilletCam were consistently lower than those for the colorimeter, indicating FilletCam's ability to detect minor color differences accurately. FilletCam exactly predicted the color scores at 73 % of instances compared to 30 % of instances for the colorimeter. Additionally, for only 3 % of instances, the predicted SF score deviated by more than two points. Overall, the developed research prototype shows promise as a valuable digital tool for the fish processing and retail industries.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (407KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Background\nRegular physical activity is critical for health and disease prevention. Yet, health care providers and patients face barriers to implement evidence-based lifestyle recommendations. The potential to augment care with the increased availability of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is limitless; however, the suitability of AI-generated exercise recommendations has yet to be explored.\nObjective\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and readability of individualized exercise recommendations generated by a novel AI chatbot.\nMethods\nA coding scheme was developed to score AI-generated exercise recommendations across ten categories informed by gold-standard exercise recommendations, including (1) health conditionâspecific benefits of exercise, (2) exercise preparticipation health screening, (3) frequency, (4) intensity, (5) time, (6) type, (7) volume, (8) progression, (9) special considerations, and (10) references to the primary literature. The AI chatbot was prompted to provide individualized exercise recommendations for 26 clinical populations using an open-source application programming interface. Two independent reviewers coded AI-generated content for each category and calculated comprehensiveness (%) and factual accuracy (%) on a scale of 0%-100%. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid formula. Qualitative analysis identified and categorized themes from AI-generated output.\nResults\nAI-generated exercise recommendations were 41.2% (107/260) comprehensive and 90.7% (146/161) accurate, with the majority (8/15, 53%) of inaccuracy related to the need for exercise preparticipation medical clearance. Average readability level of AI-generated exercise recommendations was at the college level (mean 13.7, SD 1.7), with an average Flesch reading ease score of 31.1 (SD 7.7). Several recurring themes and observations of AI-generated output included concern for liability and safety, preference for aerobic exercise, and potential bias and direct discrimination against certain age-based populations and individuals with disabilities.\nConclusions\nThere were notable gaps in the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and readability of AI-generated exercise recommendations. Exercise and health care professionals should be aware of these limitations when using and endorsing AI-based technologies as a tool to support lifestyle change involving exercise.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSystems, including humans and artificial agents, are involved in a set of coordinated tasks. The technology becomes intertwined with an individual's identity in daily life. The concept explored here encapsulates the extended-self idea within social identity theory. In this comprehensive review, the idea of shared identity of individuals interacting with AI systems is explored, along with methods, applications, and implications. Assuming that the transition to AI-enhanced society happens ubiquitously, in different categories (e.g., data analysis, text comprehension), realizing shared identity with AI systems is an important step in societal development. Because identity consists of personal and social experience, the social experience is reflected in global environment, and it in turn extends to the artificial environment. AI systems act as part of an individual's extended identity, allowing them to navigate digital spaces, share personal information, and interact with various services. The main advantage of shared identity with AI systems is in coordination improvement and task efficiency: people are better at managing tasks when a common identity is highlighted; the same might be assumed for the interaction of a human and AI systems. The application of such ideas is discussed within personal, social and global identities including a social norm, personification, bias identification, recommender system, social network, ethical considerations, cybersecurity, medical use, and developing a sense of global identity and propose ideas for refining AI Global policy. The implication of AI for employment and ethics is explored.",

Although AI-powered tools are already being implemented in some Chinese hospitals, their integration into clinical practice raises several concerns for Chinese oncologists.\nObjective\nThis study aims to explore the concerns of Chinese oncologists regarding the integration of AI into clinical practice and to identify the factors influencing these concerns.\nMethods\nA total of 228 Chinese oncologists participated in a cross-sectional web-based survey from April to June in 2023 in mainland China. The survey gauged their worries about AI with multiple-choice questions. The survey evaluated their views on the statements of âThe impact of AI on the doctor-patient relationshipâ and âAI will replace doctors.â The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and variate analyses were used to find correlations between the oncologistsâ backgrounds and their concerns.\nResults\nThe study revealed that the most prominent concerns were the potential for AI to mislead diagnosis and treatment (163/228, 71.5%); an overreliance on AI (162/228, 71%); data and algorithm bias (123/228, 54%); issues with data security and patient privacy (123/228, 54%); and a lag in the adaptation of laws, regulations, and policies in keeping up with AIâs development (115/228, 50.4%). Oncologists with a bachelorâs degree expressed heightened concerns related to data and algorithm bias (34/49, 69%; P=.03) and the lagging nature of legal, regulatory, and policy issues (32/49, 65%; P=.046). Regarding AIâs impact on doctor-patient relationships, 53.1% (121/228) saw a positive impact, whereas 35.5% (81/228) found it difficult to judge, 9.2% (21/228) feared increased disputes, and 2.2% (5/228) believed that there is no impact. Although sex differences were not significant (P=.08), perceptions variedâmale oncologists tended to be more positive than female oncologists (74/135, 54.8% vs 47/93, 50%). Oncologists with a bachelorâs degree (26/49, 53%; P=.03) and experienced clinicians (â¥21 years; 28/56, 50%; P=.054). found it the hardest to judge. Those with IT experience were significantly more positive (25/35, 71%) than those without (96/193, 49.7%; P=.02). Opinions regarding the possibility of AI replacing doctors were diverse, with 23.2% (53/228) strongly disagreeing, 14% (32/228) disagreeing, 29.8% (68/228) being neutral, 16.2% (37/228) agreeing, and 16.7% (38/228) strongly agreeing. There were no significant correlations with demographic and professional factors (all P>.05).\nConclusions\nAddressing oncologistsâ concerns about AI requires collaborative efforts from policy makers, developers, health care professionals, and legal experts. Emphasizing transparency, human-centered design, bias mitigation, and education about AIâs potential and limitations is crucial. Through close collaboration and a multidisciplinary strategy, AI can be effectively integrated into oncology, balancing benefits with ethical considerations and enhancing patient care.",

This research highlights challenges and recommendations associated when implementing AI-driven ZDM within a production system and suggests a framework to facilitate this process.\nUsing a longitudinal case study in the heavy-duty automotive industry, four AI-driven ZDM applications were examined to determine adoption dynamics. Leveraging the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theory, we identified ten application challenges and made recommendations for how to address them. The analysis highlights the importance of adhering to agile principles with continuous adaptation during AI implementation, stressing the need for feedback collection from stakeholders to assess adoption factors. This study underscores the significance of explainable AI in empowering operators and emphasizes the necessity of human-centered design principles and feedback loops to ensure AI systems truly serve their users. Building on these findings, a framework is proposed aiming for incremental value creation, continuous learning, and adaptation while considering human feedback through various channels, similar to the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle in lean management. This iterative approach, encompassing continuous improvement loops, aims to ensure successful adoption and maximize the potential of AI-driven ZDM in order to achieve operational excellence.\nThis study contributes to the existing literature on AI adoption in production systems by offering a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and recommendations associated with implementing AI-driven ZDM. Additionally, the proposed framework provides a practical roadmap for organizations seeking to leverage the power of AI to achieve zero-defect manufacturing and enhance their competitive advantage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more and more important in industrial settings, the quality and consistency of the data fed into these AI systems is becoming crucial. The success of AI models heavily relies on good data quality. Thatâs why this thesis introduces a new system for monitoring the data going into AI models as it happens, this system is tested with historical data to make sure it works well. In industries where machines and production lines need to run efficiently and reliably, having high-quality data is a big challenge. Sometimes, the data quality changes or isnât good enough, which can make the AI models give wrong results. This can make people lose trust in how well AI models work. Our paper tackles this issue by using a mix of methods - statistical, clusters and classes - to check the data in real time. We apply this to the data from an AI model designed to predict when cutting tools for glass manufacturing need to be replaced. We rate each checking method and come up with an overall score. This way, we can accurately and efficiently evaluate both the data we already know about and new, unseen data. This overall score even helps someone whoâs not an AI expert to quickly figure out if the AI model theyâre using can be trusted right now, and it also points out when something might be off with the data. Looking ahead, we plan to fine-tune how we balance the importance of each method based on different situations. This will help make our monitoring system work well for all kinds of data going into AI models, not just in glass manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nInnovated CDTS AI CAD scales from pre-existing CXR, enabling balanced AI CAD comparison.\nâ¢\nDeveloped technology advances CDTS image lesion visualization, enhancing interpretation.\nâ¢\nFindings affirm CDTS AI's diagnostic superiority, signifying effective alternative to CXR AI CAD.\nAbstract\nBackground:Compared with chest X-ray (CXR) imaging, which is a single image projected from the front of the patient, chest digital tomosynthesis (CDTS) imaging can be more advantageous for lung lesion detection because it acquires multiple images projected from multiple angles of the patient. Various clinical comparative analysis and verification studies have been reported to demonstrate this, but there is no artificial intelligence (AI)-based comparative analysis studies. Existing AI-based computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for lung lesion diagnosis have been developed mainly based on CXR images; however, CAD-based on CDTS, which uses multi-angle images of patients in various directions, has not been proposed and verified for its usefulness compared to CXR-based counterparts.\nBackground and objective:This study develops and tests a CDTS-based AI CAD system to detect lung lesions to demonstrate performance improvements compared to CXR-based AI CAD.\nMethods:We used multiple (e.g., five) projection images as input for the CDTS-based AI model and a single-projection image as input for the CXR-based AI model to compare and evaluate the performance between models. Multiple/single projection input images were obtained by virtual projection on the three-dimensional (3D) stack of computed tomography (CT) slices of each patientâs lungs from which the bed area was removed. These multiple images result from shooting from the front and left and right 30/60\n. The projected image captured from the front was used as the input for the CXR-based AI model. The CDTS-based AI model used all five projected images. The proposed CDTS-based AI model consisted of five AI models that received images in each of the five directions, and obtained the final prediction result through an ensemble of five models. Each model used WideResNet-50. To train and evaluate CXR- and CDTS-based AI models, 500 healthy data, 206 tuberculosis data, and 242 pneumonia data were used, and three three-fold cross-validation was applied.\nResults:The proposed CDTS-based AI CAD system yielded sensitivities of 0.782 and 0.785 and accuracies of 0.895 and 0.837 for the (binary classification) performance of detecting tuberculosis and pneumonia, respectively, against normal subjects. These results show higher performance than the sensitivity of 0.728 and 0.698 and accuracies of 0.874 and 0.826 for detecting tuberculosis and pneumonia through the CXR-based AI CAD, which only uses a single projection image in the frontal direction. We found that CDTS-based AI CAD improved the sensitivity of tuberculosis and pneumonia by 5.4% and 8.7% respectively, compared to CXR-based AI CAD without loss of accuracy.\nConclusions:This study comparatively proves that CDTS-based AI CAD technology can improve performance more than CXR. These results suggest that we can enhance the clinical application of CDTS. Our code is available at https://github.com/kskim-phd/CDTS-CAD-P.",

    "abstract": "Background\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of chest x-rays can increase the precision of binary COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it is unknown if AI-based chest x-rays can predict who will develop severe COVID-19, especially in low- and middle-income countries.\nObjective\nThe study aims to compare the performance of human radiologist Brixia scores versus 2 AI scoring systems in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMethods\nWe performed a cross-sectional study of 300 patients suspected with and with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Jakarta, Indonesia. A total of 2 AI scores were generated using CAD4COVID x-ray software.\nResults\nThe AI probability score had slightly lower discrimination (area under the curve [AUC] 0.787, 95% CI 0.722-0.852). The AI score for the affected lung area (AUC 0.857, 95% CI 0.809-0.905) was almost as good as the human Brixia score (AUC 0.863, 95% CI 0.818-0.908).\nConclusions\nThe AI score for the affected lung area and the human radiologist Brixia score had similar and good discrimination performance in predicting COVID-19 severity. Our study demonstrated that using AI-based diagnostic tools is possible, even in low-resource settings. However, before it is widely adopted in daily practice, more studies with a larger scale and that are prospective in nature are needed to confirm our findings.",

In this paper, we first review the history of rating systems used to evaluate AI mental health interventions. We then describe the recently introduced Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), whose scoring system allows users to grade AI mental health platforms on key domains, including credibility, user experience, crisis management, user agency, health equity, and transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the use of FAITA-Mental Health scale by systematically applying it to OCD Coach, a generative AI tool readily available on the ChatGPT store and designed to help manage the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results offer insights into the utility and limitations of FAITA-Mental Health when applied to âreal-worldâ generative AI platforms in the mental health space, suggesting that the framework effectively identifies key strengths and gaps in AI-driven mental health tools, particularly in areas such as credibility, user experience, and acute crisis management. The results also highlight the need for stringent standards to guide AI integration into mental health care in a manner that is not only effective but also safe and protective of the usersâ rights and welfare.",

Solutions for these problems are often obtained using white-box solvers based on linear program representations. Even though these algorithms are well understood and the optimality of the solution is guaranteed, explanations for the solutions are still necessary to build trust and ensure the implementation of policies. Solution algorithms represent the problem in a high-dimensional abstract space, which does not translate well to intuitive explanations for lay people. Here, we report three studies in which we pose constrained optimization problems in the form of a computer game to participants. In the game, called Furniture Factory, participants manage a company that produces furniture. In two qualitative studies, we first elicit representations and heuristics with concurrent explanations and validate their use in post-hoc explanations. We analyze the complexity of the explanations given by participants to gain a deeper understanding of how complex cognitively adequate explanations should be. Based on insights from the analysis of the two qualitative studies, we formalize strategies that in combination can act as descriptors for participantsâ behavior and optimal solutions. We match the strategies to decisions in a large behavioral dataset (\nparticipants) gathered in a third study, and compare the complexity of strategy combinations to the complexity featured in participantsâ explanations. Based on the analyses from these three studies, we discuss how these insights can inform the automatic generation of cognitively adequate explanations in future AI systems.",

All patients underwent non-contrast CT of the cervical spine. The time between CT acquisition and the moment the scan was first opened (DNT) was compared between the retrospective and prospective cohorts. The reference standard for determining diagnostic accuracy was the radiology report created in routine clinical workflow and adjusted by a senior radiologist. Discrepant cases were reviewed and clinical relevance of missed fractures was determined.\nResults\n2973 (mean age, 55.4 Â± 19.7 [standard deviation]; 1857 men) patients were analyzed by AI, including 2036 retrospective and 938 prospective cases. Overall prevalence of cervical spine fractures was 7.6 %. The DNT was 18 % (5 min) shorter in the prospective cohort. In scans positive for cervical spine fracture according to the reference standard, DNT was 46 % (16 min) shorter in the prospective cohort. Overall sensitivity of the AI application was 89.8 % (95 % CI: 84.2â94.0 %), specificity was 95.3 % (95 % CI: 94.2â96.2 %), and diagnostic accuracy was 94.8 % (95 % CI: 93.8â95.8 %). Negative predictive value was 99.1 % (95 % CI: 98.5â99.4 %) and positive predictive value was 63.0 % (95 % CI: 58.0â67.8 %). 22 fractures were missed by AI of which 5 required stabilizing therapy.\nConclusion\nA time gain of 16 min to diagnosis for fractured cases was observed after introducing AI. Although AI-assisted workflow prioritization of cervical spine fractures on CT shows high diagnostic accuracy, clinically relevant cases were missed.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across the health sector and has garnered significant attention within sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) due to polarizing views on its opportunities to advance care and the heightened risks and implications it brings to peopleâs well-being and bodily autonomy. As the fields of AI and SRHR evolve, clarity is needed to bridge our understanding of how AI is being used within this historically politicized health area and raise visibility on the critical issues that can facilitate its responsible and meaningful use.\nObjective\nThis paper presents the protocol for a scoping review to synthesize empirical studies that focus on the intersection of AI and SRHR. The review aims to identify the characteristics of AI systems and tools applied within SRHR, regarding health domains, intended purpose, target users, AI data life cycle, and evidence on benefits and harms.\nMethods\nThe scoping review follows the standard methodology developed by Arksey and OâMalley. We will search the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria comprise the use of AI systems and tools in sexual and reproductive health and clear methodology describing either quantitative or qualitative approaches, including program descriptions. Studies will be excluded if they focus entirely on digital interventions that do not explicitly use AI systems and tools, are about robotics or nonhuman subjects, or are commentaries. We will not exclude articles based on geographic location, language, or publication date. The study will present the uses of AI across sexual and reproductive health domains, the intended purpose of the AI system and tools, and maturity within the AI life cycle. Outcome measures will be reported on the effect, accuracy, acceptability, resource use, and feasibility of studies that have deployed and evaluated AI systems and tools. Ethical and legal considerations, as well as findings from qualitative studies, will be synthesized through a narrative thematic analysis. We will use the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) format for the publication of the findings.\nResults\nThe database searches resulted in 12,793 records when the searches were conducted in October 2023. Screening is underway, and the analysis is expected to be completed by July 2024.\nConclusions\nThe findings will provide key insights on usage patterns and evidence on the use of AI in SRHR, as well as convey key ethical, safety, and legal considerations. The outcomes of this scoping review are contributing to a technical brief developed by the World Health Organization and will guide future research and practice in this highly charged area of work.\nTrial Registration\nOSF Registries osf.io/ma4d9; https://osf.io/ma4d9\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nPRR1-10.2196/53888",

Scholars, researchers, and students use its advanced capabilities to achieve their educational objectives, including generating innovative ideas, delivering assignments, and conducting extensive research projects. Nevertheless, the use of ChatGPT among students is contentious, giving rise to significant apprehensions regarding integrity and AI-facilitated deceit. At the same time, scholarly communities currently need more well-defined standards for adopting such academia-oriented technology. This study aims to determine students' use of ChatGPT using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), notably the role of students' integrity in determining adoption behaviour. The analysis of 921 responses demonstrated that the utilisation of ChatGPT is influenced positively by performance expectancy, social influence, educational self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, and personal anxiety. Conversely, student integrity was found to negatively impact usage. Remarkably, student integrity has a positive moderating effect between effort expectancy and ChatGPT usage. At the same time, it has a negative moderating effect on the link between performance expectancy and technology self-efficacy with ChatGPT usage. Hence, we propose that the academic community, AI language model developers, publishers, and relevant stakeholders collaborate to establish explicit rules for the utilisation of AI chatbots in an ethical manner for educational purposes.",

This study aims to develop an optimal deep learning model to predict the thermal performance of silica gel-based standalone and Maisotsenko cycle (Mâcycle) integrated DAC systems. Fourteen different tuning models were constructed using various optimization strategies, including Bayesian optimization (GBRT and GPR), random search, dummy models, and random forest models with various acquisition functions (EI, PI, RCB, and GB hedge). These models were fine-tuned using a comprehensive set of hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate, dense layers, activation function, initialization mode, optimizer, decay rate, batch size, and epochs. The performance of each model was evaluated based on the R2 values, with the optimal model achieving an R2 value of 0.998, demonstrating high prediction accuracy. This optimal model was trained on an experimental dataset of DAC systems to predict thermal performance. The findings highlight the effectiveness of using AI-based surrogate models for the robust and optimal assessment of DAC systems, contributing to more efficient design and operation strategies for climate control technologies.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (92KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTechnology becoming the main product to enhance various aspects in the business. Artificial Intelligence has provided many conveniences in marketing business products. However, this innovative technology is not yet widely understood by the F&B microentrepreneur. The microentrepreneurs tend to focus more on developing their products rather than improving sales through product marketing using AI. This research aims to develop a conceptual framework to help micro-entrepreneurs in marketing their products by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. The framework will be developed through a focus group discussion (FGD) involving stakeholders, including the Department of Industry and Trade, the Regional Development Planning Agency, and micro-entrepreneurs, to determine gaps or deficiencies that exist among micro-entrepreneurs. The Delphi method will also be used to gather opinions from experts in AI and marketing to develop an AI model suitable for micro-entrepreneurs. The model will involve the use of chat GPT, a simplified version of AI, and copy AI. The end result will be a prototype of an AI model that is tailored to the needs of micro-entrepreneurs, with the potential to improve their marketing capabilities and overall business operations. The framework will also include the use of digital marketing to provide a platform for micro-entrepreneurs to develop their online segmentation. The ultimate goal of this research is to bridge the gap between AI marketing and digital transformation, creating a user-friendly application for micro-entrepreneurs to increase their marketing capacity.",

Despite the growing attention towards ChatGPT as a metacognitive learning tool, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing its acceptance in academic settings. Engaging 300 preservice teachers through a ChatGPT-based scenario learning activity and utilizing convenience sampling, this study administered a questionnaire based on the proposed Technology Acceptance Model at UTM University's School of Education. Structural equation modelling was applied to analyze participants' perspectives on ChatGPT, considering factors like MSRL's impact on usage intention. Post-reflection sessions, semi-structured interviews, and record analysis were conducted to gather results. Findings indicate a high acceptance of ChatGPT, significantly influenced by personal competency, social influence, perceived AI usefulness, enjoyment, trust, AI intelligence, positive attitude, and metacognitive self-regulated learning. Interviews and record analysis suggest that academics view ChatGPT positively as an educational tool, seeing it as a solution to challenges in teaching and learning processes. The study highlights ChatGPT's potential to enhance MSRL and holds implications for teacher education and AI integration in educational settings.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory synthesis has been the main generator of new inorganic materials for decades. However, our Edisonian and bias-prone processes of synthetic exploration alone are no longer sufficient in an age that demands rapid advances in materials development. In this work, we demonstrate an end-to-end attempt towards systematic, computer-aided discovery and laboratory synthesis of inorganic crystalline compounds as a modern alternative to purely exploratory synthesis. Our approach initializes materials discovery campaigns by autonomously mapping the synthetic feasibility of a chemical system using density functional theory with AI feedback. Following expert-driven down-selection of newly generated phases, we use solid-state synthesis and in situ characterization via hot-stage X-ray diffraction in order to realize new ternary oxide phases experimentally. We applied this strategy in six ternary transition-metal oxide chemistries previously considered well-explored, one of which culminated in the discovery of two novel phases of calcium ruthenates. Detailed characterization using room temperature X-ray powder diffraction, 4D-STEM and SQUID measurements identifies the structure and composition and confirms distinct properties, including distinct defect concentrations, of one of the new phases formed in our experimental campaigns. While the discovery of a new material guided by AI and DFT theory represents a milestone, our procedure and results also highlight a number of critical gaps in the process that can inform future efforts towards the improvement of AI-coupled methodologies.\nExploratory synthesis has been the main generator of new inorganic materials for decades. AI-assisted discovery is possible, but human-AI collaboration should be refined according to their respective strengths.\nDownload: Download high-res image (152KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 2.0, computers are now equipped with new creative capabilities and are playing an increasingly significant role in design. The use of AI augmentation has the potential to enhance design performance, however, there is limited research on the acceptance of AI-augmented design. The research gap under consideration in this study is addressed by presenting an acceptance model designed for AI-augmented design. This model integrates a range of variables including perceived privacy risk, enjoyment, perceived value, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived behavioral control, social influence, and behavioral intention. The proposed model was validated through a questionnaire survey of 249 designers in China.\nThe results reveal that enjoyment, perceived value, perceived ease of use, perceived behavioral control, and social influence have a significant positive impact on users' intention to use AI-augmented design, while perceived privacy risk has a significant negative impact. Perceived value was found to mediate the relationship between enjoyment and behavioral intention, while perceived behavioral control play a mediation role in the relationship between social influence and behavioral intention.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the variables that influence the acceptance of AI-augmented design and provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating AI technologies in design. The proposed acceptance model serves as a framework for future research in this area and can guide the development of more user-friendly and effective AI-augmented design tools and technologies.",

The authors were inspired by George Hintonâs statement that artificial intelligence (AI) would supersede radiologists, and ventured to investigate whether the AI software Milvue Suite which had been trained on a few hundred thousand chest and musculoskeletal x-rays, could pass the rapid reporting section of the FRCR â an exam which must be passed in order to practice as a consultant radiologist in the UK. This brief comment sums up the company's opinions and perspective from the practical AI developmental angle and also its translation into a commercially viable and clinically useful tool. Hoping this will provide a fair and balanced view of the role of AI in radiology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn exponential growth of interest in the healthcare IoT over the past few years has increased the adoption of AI. However, healthcare analytics demands highly accurate and reliable systems that can not afford even a small amount of vulnerability. The black-box nature of AI models raises significant concerns about the computations involved in these predictions, leading to a lack of trust in these models. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) seeks to resolve this problem by providing a human-understandable explanation for AI decisions, bringing transparency, trust, and fairness to these AI models. This paper evaluates the existing XAI models on numeric and graph-structured healthcare data. The LIME and SHAP models are first used to explain the predictions in the numerical dataset of fetal health prediction. Second, graph-structured data is analyzed using GNN Explainer and PG Explainer. This evaluation suggests that XAI model interpretations benefit healthcare professionals and patients to trust AI predictions.",

The two mainstream methods â vignette studies and case studies â reveal important but inconsistent insights. Here we discuss the respective limitations of vignette studies (affective forecasting errors, biased media coverage, and question substitution) and case studies (social desirability biases and lack of random assignment and control conditions), which may lead them to overrate negative and positive reactions to AI management, respectively. We further discuss the advantages of a third method for mitigating these limitations: field experiments on crowdsourced marketplaces. A proof-of-concept study on Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk; as a world-leading crowdsourcing platform) showed unique human reactions to AI management, which were not perfectly aligned with those in vignette or case studies. Participants (N = 504) did not differ significantly under AI versus human management, in terms of performance, intrinsic motivation, fairness perception, and commitment. We suggest that crowdsourced marketplaces can go beyond human research subject pools and become models of AI-managed workplaces, facilitating timely behavioral research and robust predictions on human-centered work designs and organizations.",

Importantly, this article presents potential paradoxes of GenAI-enabled customer service, adding to the debate about the role and impact of GenAI for brands. Specifically, we present six paradoxes of GenAI customer service: (1) connected yet isolated, (2) lower cost yet higher price, (3) higher quality yet less empathy, (4) satisfied yet frustrated, (5) personalized yet intrusive, and (6) powerful yet vulnerable. For each paradox, we suggest brand response strategies to mitigate downside and manage potential upside.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo address the increasing demand for AI literacy, we introduced a novel active learning approach that leverages both teaching assistants (TAs) and generative AI to provide feedback during in-class exercises. This method was evaluated through two studies in separate Computer Science courses, focusing on the roles and impacts of TAs in this learning environment, as well as their collaboration with ChatGPT in enhancing student feedback. The studies revealed that TAs were effective in accurately determining studentsâ progress and struggles, particularly in areas such as âbacktrackingâ, where students faced significant challenges. This interventionâs success was evident from high student engagement and satisfaction levels, as reported in an end-of-semester survey. Further findings highlighted that while TAs provided detailed technical assessments and identified conceptual gaps effectively, ChatGPT excelled in presenting clarifying examples and offering motivational support. Despite some TAsâ resistance to fully embracing the feedback guidelines-specifically their reluctance to provide encouragement-the collaborative feedback process between TAs and ChatGPT improved the quality of feedback in several aspects, including technical accuracy and clarity in explaining conceptual issues. These results suggest that integrating human and artificial intelligence in educational settings can significantly enhance traditional teaching methods, creating a more dynamic and responsive learning environment. Future research will aim to improve both the quality and efficiency of feedback, capitalizing on unique strengths of both human and AI to further advance educational practices in the field of computing.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAs the availability and performance of artificial intelligence (AI)âbased clinical decision support (CDS) systems improve, physicians and other care providers poised to be on the front lines will be increasingly tasked with using these tools in patient care and incorporating their outputs into clinical decision-making processes. Vignette studies provide a means to explore emerging hypotheses regarding how context-specific factors, such as clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the AI result, may impact physician acceptance and use of AI-based CDS tools. To best anticipate how such factors influence the decision-making of frontline physicians in clinical scenarios involving AI decision-support tools, hypothesis-driven research is needed that enables scenario testing before the implementation and deployment of these tools.\nObjective\nThis studyâs objectives are to (1) design an original, web-based vignette-based survey that features hypothetical scenarios based on emerging or real-world applications of AI-based CDS systems that will vary systematically by features related to clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the AI result; and (2) test and determine causal effects of specific factors on the judgments and perceptions salient to physiciansâ clinical decision-making.\nMethods\nUS-based physicians with specialties in family or internal medicine will be recruited through email and mail (target n=420). Through a web-based survey, participants will be randomized to a 3-part âsequential multiple assignment randomization trial (SMART) vignetteâ detailing a hypothetical clinical scenario involving an AI decision support tool. The SMART vignette design is similar to the SMART design but adapted to a survey design. Each respondent will be randomly assigned to 1 of the possible vignette variations of the factors we are testing at each stage, which include the level of clinical risk, the amount of information provided about the AI, and the certainty of the AI output. Respondents will be given questions regarding their hypothetical decision-making in response to the hypothetical scenarios.\nResults\nThe study is currently in progress and data collection is anticipated to be completed in 2024.\nConclusions\nThe web-based vignette study will provide information on how contextual factors such as clinical risk, the amount of information provided about an AI tool, and the AI result influence physiciansâ reactions to hypothetical scenarios that are based on emerging applications of AI in frontline health care settings. Our newly proposed âSMART vignetteâ design offers several benefits not afforded by the extensively used traditional vignette design, due to the 2 aforementioned features. These advantages are (1) increased validity of analyses targeted at understanding the impact of a factor on the decision outcome, given previous outcomes and other contextual factors; and (2) balanced sample sizes across groups. This study will generate a better understanding of physician decision-making within this context.\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nDERR1-10.2196/54787",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn remote areas, particularly in developing countries, there is a growing interest in off-grid solar PV systems for their ability to provide clean and affordable electricity. However, these systems often face limitations in powering essential amenities, including sports facilities, due to restricted capabilities and inadequate battery storage. To address these challenges and promote energy independence, this paper proposes an AI-enabled sports-system peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network within the digital economy. This innovative system leverages AI to optimize energy distribution specifically for sports-related infrastructures, ensuring efficient use of solar power and improved energy availability for both recreational and community needs. The proposed P2P network operates on a three-part Internet of Things (IoT) framework, facilitating automatic energy sharing among interconnected systems. This approach not only enhances the performance of existing solar power setups but also ensures that energy demands for sports facilities are met effectively. Feasibility studies of this system reveal promising outcomes, including a 13.67% increase in community energy independence and a 12.20% reduction in overall energy consumption. The AI-powered sports-system network demonstrates its potential to support sustainable development and improve the quality of life in remote areas by integrating sports and energy needs within the digital economy context.",

Traditional translation teaching methods have many limitations, such as time and space limitations, increased labor costs, etc. In this context, this article explored the application of translation technology based on AI in translation teaching. In this paper, neural machine translation (NMT) algorithm was used to encode and decode the original text to generate the corresponding translation. The statistical machine translation (SMT) algorithm was used to build the translation model, which was based on the statistical model. The algorithm searched for the best translation hypothesis through inference, which can improve the accuracy and readability of translation. Compared with traditional machine translation (MT), the accuracy rate of AI based translation in this paper reached 97â¯%, which was far higher than traditional MT and more suitable for teaching. The improvement in student translation was also relatively obvious, which can be clearly seen through studentsâ translation test scores. At the same time, the teacher's satisfaction with the AI translation teaching system in this article was also high, with an average score of 92 points. Through the application research of translation technology based on AI in translation teaching, AI translation teaching has a positive promoting effect on improving studentsâ translation level and efficiency.",

Based on a particular IBL framework that synthesizes the core attributes of IBL by combining the strengths of various models, the study explores educators' potential utilization of GenAI tools across the framework's phases. Among other capabilities, GenAI tools were examined for their support in content creation, assessment and feedback processes, as well as in the design of learning activities and lesson plans. This examination informed the classification of GenAI tools in this study, organizing them according to their potential utility for educators. These groups and subgroups of tools were then aligned with each phase of the IBL framework, demonstrating their role in achieving the objectives of each phase. Several practical examples across different grade levels and disciplines were also provided to highlight their prospective use. The systematic classification of GenAI tools introduced in this study fills a notable gap in the literature, thus making a valuable contribution to the field of GenAI in education. Additionally, by demonstrating how this classification can be applied as educators craft and deliver IBL lesson plans, the study further contributes by providing guidance on the effective use of these tools in real-world educational contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding air entrainment phenomena induced by plunging water jets is critical in the fields of nuclear and hydraulic engineering. Air entrainment is one of the key safety design parameters for nuclear systems. However, most existing studies rely on empirical correlations or curve-fitting models to estimate bubble penetration depth, and no agreed-upon calculation principle exists for varying jet conditions. To address these limitations, this research developed two advanced AI approaches: an improved YOLOv5 for segmenting air entrainment and the NSGA-III-BPNN method for predicting penetration depth. The improved YOLOv5 enables real-time segmentation and extraction of air entrainment motion and dynamics under diverse conditions, demonstrating high scalability and robustness. The penetration depth estimated using the improved YOLOv5 shows greater accuracy compared to conventional empirical correlationsand is more efficient than traditional image post-processing techniques for classifying shape regimes based on dynamic air entrainment patterns. To overcome the limitations of object segmentation, which typically relies on video or image data, the NSGA-III-BPNN method predicts maximum penetration depths with greater accuracy than YOLOv5, offering a more effective prediction model for air entrainment penetration depth. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the research not only provides valuable segmentation data for refining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling but also paves the way for significant advancements in both nuclear and hydraulic engineering.",

The key concern is the epistemological shift from traditional deductive approaches to an inductive approach brought about by AI technologies. The paper elaborates on shifts related to the forms, practices, and infrastructures of management control, discussing new avenues for research in social studies of accounting. The discussion outlines how the integration of AI in accounting not only changes accounting practice but also fuels the relevance of some of the prior insights about social aspects of calculative practices. On a final note, the paper also suggests that, given the speed and scope at which new calculative technology is being introduced in virtually all parts of society, accounting scholars may draw upon prior insights and contribute to wider debates about the social impact of AI in society.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are expected to solve pressing challenges in healthcare services worldwide. However, the current state of introducing AI is characterised by several issues complicating and delaying their deployments. These issues concern topics such as ethics, regulations, data access, human trust, and limited evidence of AI technologies in real-world clinical settings. They further encompass uncertainties, for instance, whether AI technologies will ensure equal and safe patient treatment or whether the AI results will be accurate and transparent enough to establish user trust. Collective efforts by actors from different backgrounds and affiliations are required to navigate this complex landscape. This article explores the role of such collective efforts by investigating how an informally established network of professionals works to enable AI in the Norwegian public healthcare services. The study takes a qualitative longitudinal case study approach and is based on data from non-participant observations of digital meetings and interviews. The data are analysed by drawing on perspectives and concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) dealing with innovation and sociotechnical change, where collective efforts are conceptualised as actor mobilisation. The study finds that in the case of the ambiguous sociotechnical phenomenon of AI, some of the uncertainties related to the introduction of AI in healthcare may be reduced as more and more deployments occur, while others will prevail or emerge. Mobilising spokespersons representing actors not yet a part of the discussions, such as AI users or researchers studying AI technologies in use, can enable a âstrongerâ hybrid knowledge production. This hybrid knowledge is essential to identify, mitigate and monitor existing and emerging uncertainties, thereby ensuring sustainable AI deployments.",

Previous studies have focused mostly on the influence of generative AI on writing while few researchers have investigated how generative AI can facilitate students' multimodal writing process. To fill in this gap, we explored the generative AI-assisted composing processes of two groups of English as a foreign language (EFL) writers over two weeks in this qualitative study. One group completed a multimodal PowerPoint (PPT) project, and the other group completed a traditional argumentative essay project. Our data consist of studentsâ screen recordings with think-aloud protocols, final multimodal texts, and post-project interviews. Our analysis showed different patterns in text production across the two groups. Students in the PPT group tended to construct more bridge texts and examples to corroborate their sub-claims in the hierarchical order. They also inclined to borrow the summarized search results from the Bing Chat to expand texts for their PPT slides. With regard to image generation for PPT slides, descriptions of AI images from ChatGPT were used as effective prompts to generate AI images from Bing Image Creator. Moreover, students were interested in producing and refining AI images following the recommended prompts by Bing Chat. They also evaluated these AI images from different perspectives. We conclude the study with a discussion on the pedagogical implications and suggestions for further study.",

Exploring the main features and best practices for designing user interfaces for Web applications, which effectively support and leverage AI functionalities, is currently one of the relevant topics in this context. This research work discusses the fundamental principles of user interface (UI) design, and the challenges posed by the integration of AI into web applications. It emphasizes the need to strike a balance between the AI advanced capabilities and the users' ability to understand and control the system. Furthermore, the paper highlights the importance of creating intuitive and engaging UI designs that empower users to interact with AI-driven features effortlessly. The study presents a comprehensive analysis of various UI design techniques specifically tailored for AI-enabled web applications user interfaces. Additionally, the paper explores the incorporation of AI-driven recommendation systems, personalized interfaces, and adaptive designs, which dynamically adapt to users' preferences and behavior. To validate the proposed user interface design principles, the study presents a proposal for a guidelines structure that promotes empirical evaluations through user studies and usability testing. Results collected via a survey based on measuring the effectiveness and user satisfaction of AI-enabled Web interfaces. User interfaces in real-life scenarios are presented and provides information on the impact of UI design decisions on user interaction and overall experience. The outcomes of this research work contribute to a deeper understanding of UI design for AI-supported Web applications user interfaces and offer practical guidelines for designers and developers. By embracing the suggested principles, organizations and designers can create Web interfaces that effectively harness the power of AI while prioritizing user-centricity, accessibility, and ethical considerations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a deep and critical analysis of Singapore's new wave of state-built digital tools and services and how it connects to its larger smart urbanism project, also known as Smart Nation. The COVID-19 pandemic, and particularly Singapore's response, served as a real-world testing ground for smart urbanist strategies. In particular, we analysed the logic that emanates from these novel digital interventions, how they operate on the complex urban built environment and the population, and their effects on urban and citizenry morphologies. Next, we examined a series of state-led technological implementations that have emerged since the Covid-19 pandemic, providing digital solutions that assist citizens with the changing rhythms of everyday living, data-capturing sensors and gantries to aid authorities in contract tracing efforts and enforce vaccination differentiation measures, geospatial digital mapping of demographic data, in withal robotics for automated policing and cleaning activities; and the use of AI and automated data-driven tools in public health to improve service delivery and care to patients. While we are unable to exhaust every piece of technology for the purpose of this paper, these developments, along with their design thinking and operations, we argue, are helpful in revealing the contemporary conjectures of Singaporean digital urban idealism and the governing strategies of the state. By examining Singapore's response, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on smart urbanism, offering insights into how cities can leverage technology effectively while balancing technological innovation with privacy and public trust.",

We use public value theory to test how value positions shape these design choices. In a conjoint experiment, we asked German citizens (n = 1690) and front desk officers in municipalities (n = 267) to evaluate hypothetical chatbot designs that differ in their fulfillment of goals derived from different value positions: (1) maintaining security, privacy, and accountability, (2) improving administrative performance, and (3) improving user-friendliness and empathy. Experimental results show that citizens prefer chatbots programmed by domestic firms, value chatbots taking routine decisions excluding discretion, and strongly prefer human intervention when conversations fail. While altering the salience of public sector values through priming does not affect citizens' design choices consistently, we find systematic differences between citizens and front desk officers. However, these differences are qualitative rather than fundamental. We conclude that citizens and front desk officers share public values that provide a sufficient basis for chatbot designs that overcome a potential legitimacy gap of AI in citizens-state service encounters.",

We draw inspiration from diverse fields, including non-traditional simulation methodologies and open innovation dynamics, to create a framework that leverages the combined strengths of individual algorithms. Three machine learning algorithms â decision trees, logistic regression, and naÃ¯ve Bayes â are rigorously evaluated for their efficacy in classifying and assigning algorithms within an ensemble model for a new service. A simulated dataset, informed by expert tagging, is the training ground, ensuring practical relevance. We employ the voting probability metric on a held-out test set to provide a robust measure of accuracy in this critical task. Our findings reveal the significant potential of AI-powered personalized meal services. Ensemble models demonstrate high accuracy, showcasing the collaboration of combining individual algorithms. This originality lies in applying ensemble techniques to a business case with far-reaching implications for management and societal well-being. Beyond technical success, we explore this technologyâs broader impact.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nElectronic health records (EHRs) are a valuable source of information that can aid in understanding a patientâs health condition and making informed healthcare decisions. However, modelling longitudinal EHRs with heterogeneous information is a challenging task. Although recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are frequently utilized in artificial intelligence (AI) models for capturing longitudinal data, their explanatory capabilities are limited. Predictive clustering stands as the most recent advancement within this domain, offering interpretable indications at the cluster level for predicting disease risk. Nonetheless, the challenge of determining the optimal number of clusters has put a brake on the widespread application of predictive clustering for disease risk prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric predictive clustering-based risk prediction model that integrates the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) with predictive clustering via neural networks. To enhance the modelâs interpretability, we integrate attention mechanisms that enable the capture of local-level evidence in addition to the cluster-level evidence provided by predictive clustering. The outcome of this research is the development of a multi-level explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model. We evaluated the proposed model on two real-world datasets and demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing longitudinal EHR information for disease risk prediction. Moreover, the model successfully produced interpretable evidence to bolster its predictions.",

However, the search for suitable materials with desired properties, including high ionic and electronic conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical compatibility, presents ongoing challenges that impede widespread adoption and further advancement in the field. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a versatile tool capable of enhancing and expediting the materials discovery cycle in CECs through data-driven modeling, simulation, and optimization techniques. Herein, we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art AI applications for materials design and optimization for CECs, covering various material aspects, database construction, data pre-processing, and AI methods. We also present some representative case studies of AI-predicted and synthesized materials for CECs and provide insightful highlights about their approaches. We emphasize the main implications and contributions of the AI approach for advancing the CEC technology, such as reducing the trial-and-error experiments, exploring the vast materials space, discovering novel and optimal materials, and enhancing the understanding of the materials-performance relationships. We also discuss the AI approach's main limitations and future directions for CECs, such as addressing the data and model challenges, improving and extending the AI models and methods, and integrating with other computational and experimental techniques. We conclude by suggesting some potential applications and collaborations for AI in materials design for CECs.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (236KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

In this qualitative study, we explore how public organizations strategically manage the adoption of AI. Managing AI adoption in the public sector is complex because of the inherent tension between public organizations' identity, characterized by formal and rigid structures, and the demands of AI innovation that require experimentation and flexibility. Our findings show that public organizations navigate this tension either by creating separate departments for data science teams, or by integrating data science teams into already existing operational departments. The case studies reveal that separation improves the technical expertise and capabilities of the organization, whereas integration improves the alignment between AI and primary processes. The findings also show that both approaches are characterized by different AI adoption barriers. We empirically identify the processes and routines public organizations develop to overcome these barriers.",

But did the COVID-19 pandemic inadvertently accelerate the pace of AI adoption in pharmaceutical innovation? We answer this question using novel data on pharmaceutical patents. We use two different databases to analyze abstracts of pharmaceutical patents applied in the USA. Topic modeling was used to identify patents with technical artifacts and classify them as treated group AI-adopting patents. An AI dictionary is used to match AI-related keywords in the patent abstracts. Subsequently, using a difference-in-differences research design we observe that both presence and count of AI keywords in pharmaceutical patents have increased with pandemic. An increase in AI is also related to reduced time taken from application to publication of a patent suggesting innovation efficiencies in the industry. Finally, we find that results are driven by firms that have already built AI capability in the past. Our results remain consistent with various robustness checks, and we conclude by discussing managerial and policy implications of our findings.",

Drawing on 48 interviews with advertising professionals, we identify three operational paradoxes that are associated with conducting research, creativity, efficiency, and one psychological paradox related to work identity. To gain a competitive advantage, we urge practitioners to adopt a confrontation-based coping strategy to navigate these paradoxes.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of manufacturing companies have initiated designing and implementing AI systems in manufacturing, however, with limited success. Within our overarching research objective of establishing a methodology for the development of AI systems in manufacturing with socio-technical system consideration, this paper focuses on the early design phase of the development life cycle and aims to identify factors that are essential in the phase but whose importance has been less addressed in the manufacturing literature. To this aim, a case study was conducted adopting a design science approach. The case company was developing an ML-based anomaly detection system for a casting process. The researcher organised an AI system design workshop where participants from the company used the Human-AI design guidelines created by a leading large software company. The workshop enabled the participants to explore a wide range of design concerns. It, however, caused the confusing experience that they had to deal with too many questions simultaneously without clear guidance. Analysing this negative experience has led to identifying four design issues requiring further attention in the research. An example of these issues is that the interdependency of design decisions on operational procedures, human-machine interfaces, ML models, pre-processing, and input data makes it challenging to design these elements in isolation. The study found that a structured approach to dealing with the identified issues was currently lacking. This paper contributes to the manufacturing research community by addressing key unresolved issues in the research through highlighting practical details of designing AI systems in manufacturing.",

This study blends multilevel thresholding, neural network optimisation, and image preprocessing to craft a robust AI model capable of accurately categorising diverse brain tumour types and normal cases. Through rigorous testing with a comprehensive dataset of 1747 images, the model achieves an accuracy of 92%. Its integration into a user-friendly smartphone app, MediScan, enhances accessibility and practicality. The app provides heatmap visualisations and generates diagnostic reports, supporting medical professionals in making swift decisions. The model prioritises interpretability enhancement and has the potential to cultivate collaboration between AI experts and medical practitioners, thus advancing the field of brain tumour detection and diagnosis. While promising, the model demands computational resources and diverse datasets. This research also highlights AI's potential to transform healthcare diagnostics, ensuring precise and efficient brain tumour identification.",

In response, we propose the BANSAI approach (Bridging the AI Adoption Gap via Neurosymbolic AI). It systematically leverages principles of neurosymbolic AI to establish data-driven, subsymbolic program synthesis and optimization in modern industrial robot programming workflow.

We detail three specific applications in the sector of critical infrastructure maintenance: Explainable AI (XAI) for risk classification, structural defects recognition, and real-time monitoring through IoT. The proposed approach employs tamper-resistant ledgers for tracking key processes such as dataset collection, model training, and inference generation, thereby ensuring non-repudiability for recorded actions and enabling auditability. We demonstrate how this strengthens the explainability mechanisms of AI models and enables the production of verifiable data lineage and certified inferences. Our framework can be applied to existing AI solutions, enhancing their trustworthiness.",

However, digital applications for the healthcare domain need to be interoperable to maximize their potential. Additionally, with the rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Machine Learning (ML), large amounts of diverse types of data are being utilized. Thus, to achieve interoperability in such applications, the adoption of common semantic data models becomes imperative. In this paper, we describe the adoption of such a common semantic data model, using the well-known Health Level Seven Fast Health Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) standard, in a platform that assists in the creation and storage of a plethora of AI-based applications for several medical conditions. The FHIR serverâs efficiency is being showcased by using it in an application predicting coronary artery stenosis as well as for managing the platformâs key performance indicators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerative AI is rapidly evolving with high expectations about its potential use and benefits; however, the health and aged care sectors balance risks with gaining value from its implementation and adoption. It is also challenging for policy makers to ensure public safety without constraining innovation. In this exploratory study, we interview seven experts from Australia and internationally with a range of expertise across the Health Care ecosystem with an interest in Generative AI. We aligned our enquiry to policy, organizational, practitioner and patient views and levels of abstraction to understand the enablers and barriers to AI implementation and adoption. We found that many of the factors we identified were consistent with prior research. We understood some factors in more detail in the Australian context and further emphasized the importance of cultural perspectives, participatory design and a gap between the international policy setting and practice considerations. Based on our findings we suggest the need for co-design integration across different levels of the health and aged care innovation ecosystem within aspects of the Generative AI âdesign, develop, and deployâ lifecycle.",

By utilizing AI, the efficiency of the process is significantly improved through enhanced precision, reduced time and cost, high-performance algorithms and AI-enabled computer-aided drug design (CADD). Effective drug screening techniques are crucial for identifying potential hit compounds from large volumes of data in compound repositories. The inclusion of AI in drug discovery, including the screening of hit compounds and lead molecules, has proven to be more effective than traditional in vitro screening assays. This article reviews the advancements in drug screening methods achieved through AI-enhanced applications, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms. It specifically focuses on AI applications in the drug discovery phase, exploring screening strategies and lead optimization techniques such as Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, pharmacophore modeling, de novo drug designing, and high-throughput virtual screening. Valuable insights into different aspects of the drug screening process are discussed, highlighting the role of AI-based tools, pipelines, and case studies in simplifying the complexities associated with drug discovery.",

This âConvention on Artificial Intelligence, Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Lawâ (AI Convention) aims to protect human rights against the harms of AI. The AI Convention may become the first legally-binding international treaty on AI. In this article, we highlight the implications of the proposed AI Convention for the health and human rights protection of patients. We praise the following characteristics [1]. Global regulation for technology that easily crosses jurisdictions [2]. The human rights-based approach with human rights assessment [3]. The actor-neutral, full-lifecycle approach [4]. The creation of enforceable rights through the European Human Rights Court. We signal the following challenges [1]. The sector-neutral approach [2]. The lack of reflection on new human rights [3]. Definitional issues, and [4] The process of global negotiations. We conclude that it is important for the Council of Europe not to compromise on the wide scope of application and the rights-based character of the proposed AI Convention.",

Currently, objective assessment of chewing function is a clinical challenge. Previously, several methods have been developed and proposed, but implementing these methods in clinics may not be feasible. Therefore, more efforts are needed for accurate assessment of chewing function and clinical use.\nAim\nThe study aimed to establish a proof of concept for development and validation of an automated tool for evaluating masticatory function.\nMethods\nYOLOv8, a deep neural network, was fine-tuned and trained to detect and segment food fragments. The model's performance was assessed using bounding box recall metrics, segmentation metrics, confusion matrix, and sensitivity values. Additionally, a separate conversion test set evaluated the model's segmentation performance using physical units, demonstrated with Bland-Altman diagrams.\nResults\nThe YOLOv8-model achieved recall and sensitivity rates exceeding 90%, effectively detecting and classifying food fragments. Out of 316 ground truth fragments, 301 were correctly classified, with 15 missed and 5 false positives. The Bland-Altman diagram indicated general agreement but suggested a systematic overestimation in measuring the size of post-masticated food fragments.\nConclusion\nAI presents a reliable approach for automated analysis of masticatory performance. The developed application proves to be a valuable tool for future clinical assessment of masticatory function.\nClinical significance\nThe current study provides a proof of concept for development of an automated tool for clinical assessment of masticatory function.",

Laboratory management failures can pose significant hazards.\nMethods\nAn external system captured images of personnel entering a laboratory, which were then analyzed by an AI-based system to verify their compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) regulations, thereby introducing an additional layer of protection. A deep learning model was trained to detect the presence of essential PPE items, such as clothing, masks, hoods, double-layer gloves, shoe covers, and respirators, ensuring adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The internal laboratory management system used a deep learning model to delineate alert zones and monitor compliance with the imposed safety protocols.\nResults\nThe external detection system was trained on a dataset consisting of 4,112 images divided into 15 PPE compliance classes. The model achieved an accuracy of 97.52% and a recall of 97.03%. The identification results were presented in real time via a visual interface and simultaneously stored on the administratorâs dashboard for future reference. We trained the internal management system on 3347 images, achieving 90% accuracy and 85% recall. The results were transmitted in JSON format to the internal monitoring system, which triggered alerts in response to violations of safe practices or alert zones. Real-time notifications were sent to the administrators when the safety thresholds were met.\nConclusion\nThe BSL-3 laboratory monitoring system significantly reduces the risk of exposure to pathogens for personnel during laboratory operations. By ensuring the correct use of PPE and enhancing adherence to the imposed safety protocols, this system contributes to maintaining the integrity of BSL-3 facilities and mitigates the risk of personnel becoming infection vectors.",

Therefore, people's perspectives about this transformative change involving creativity and art must be examined. We investigated attitudes toward using AI in art from the perspective of self-determination theory. We used data from a two-wave survey of Finnish respondents aged 18â80 years (n = 828) to analyze within- and between-person effects using hybrid multilevel regression modelling. We measured positive attitudes toward using AI in (a) the art and culture field in general, (b) music, (c) visual arts, (d) detecting forged art, and (e) creating art. The main independent variables were the basic psychological needs (perceived relatedness, autonomy, and competence) in using new technologies. The results showed that participants were less positive toward using AI in the art and culture field in general compared to many other fields, such as medicine and building and real estate technology. Stronger relatedness had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in the art and culture field in general, as well as in music, visual arts, and creating art. Stronger autonomy had within- and between-person effects on positive attitudes on using AI in detecting forged art and creating art. The results indicate that human needs for relatedness and autonomy are important in attitudes toward using AI in art. Hence, positive personal experiences with the use of new technology are likely to affect how people perceive the introduction of AI to the art field, which has been considered the last human frontier in the technological world.",

However, it remains underexamined how engineering students choose to use GenAI or not, along with the reasons behind their choices. To fill in this research gap, this study presents a natural experiment that examines student use or non-use of GenAI tools in engineering design tasks in an undergraduate course. In this experiment, the participants (n=403) were provided with an unconstrained access to an GPT 4.0-empowered chatbot and were allowed to use it for their design projects voluntarily. Overall, 59.80% of the students had reported substantial use of GenAI in their design projects, and 40.20% showed limited or no use. Those adopters used GenAI to aid idea generation and brainstorming, to mediate discussions with instructors/TA, to overcome non-technical expertise gaps, and to optimize the solution. Conversely, non-adopters attributed their reluctance and rejection to inherent limitations in GenAI outputs, misalignment between GenAI functionalities and project needs, a lack of adaptation and prompt skills, and unclear benefits of GenAI use for personal development. This study has challenged the popular assumption of naturally active GenAI adoption by uncovering the complexity and multiplicities in student behaviors. The findings highlight the necessity of establish a consensus on the role and value of GenAI across various stakeholders, while suggesting a need for adaptation in engineering education research and practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in customer relationship management (CRM) holds great potential for enhancing organizational effectiveness. To achieve successful AI-CRM integration, companies must navigate a landscape filled with challenges and complexities marked by the distinctive nature of CRM processes. However, both academics and practitioners still face challenges in understanding the organizational and managerial elements crucial for successful AI-CRM integration. This study aims to fill this gap by identifying the challenges businesses must overcome in the process of AI integration in a CRM context, from the first discover phase to the final sustain phase. Since the context of AI-CRM integration encompasses expertise in artificial intelligence, customer relationship management, data science, and business management, we utilize a research approach that involves qualitative interviews with several actors (managers, consultants and specialists) across these domains to gain diverse insights into AI-CRM integration challenges and opportunities. We identified eleven specific challenges associated with AI-powered CRM and uncovered a temporal division of these challenges across the four phases of AI implementation. Furthermore, we have developed guidelines for addressing them effectively. The findings contribute to an empirical understanding of AI-CRM integration, offering a long-term perspective on leveraging AI for customer relationships. This research lays the foundation for exploring the activities and capabilities required to navigate the challenges of AI-CRM integration and provides essential questions for managers embarking on this journey.",

In this paper, we propose an enhanced human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning method, termed the Human as AI mentor-based deep reinforcement learning (HAIM-DRL) framework, which facilitates safe and efficient autonomous driving in mixed traffic platoon. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, we first introduce an innovative learning paradigm that effectively injects human intelligence into AI, termed Human as AI mentor (HAIM). In this paradigm, the human expert serves as a mentor to the AI agent. While allowing the agent to sufficiently explore uncertain environments, the human expert can take control in dangerous situations and demonstrate correct actions to avoid potential accidents. On the other hand, the agent could be guided to minimize traffic flow disturbance, thereby optimizing traffic flow efficiency. In detail, HAIM-DRL leverages data collected from free exploration and partial human demonstrations as its two training sources. Remarkably, we circumvent the intricate process of manually designing reward functions; instead, we directly derive proxy state-action values from partial human demonstrations to guide the agentsâ policy learning. Additionally, we employ a minimal intervention technique to reduce the human mentorâs cognitive load. Comparative results show that HAIM-DRL outperforms traditional methods in driving safety, sampling efficiency, mitigation of traffic flow disturbance, and generalizability to unseen traffic scenarios.",

However, in abnormal states, the NPP condition fluctuates rapidly, which can lead to human error. If human error occurs, the condition of an NPP can deteriorate, leading to reactor trips. Sudden shutdowns, such as reactor trips, can result in the failure of numerous NPP facilities and economic losses. This study develops a remaining trip time (RTT) prediction system as part of an operator support system to reduce possible human errors and improve the safety of NPPs. The RTT prediction system consists of an algorithm that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as autoencoders, light gradient-boosting machines, and Shapley additive explanations. AI methods provide diagnostic information about the abnormal states that occur and predict the remaining time until a reactor trip occurs. The XAI method improves the reliability of AI by providing a rationale for RTT prediction results and information on the main variables of the status of NPPs. The RTT prediction system includes an interface that can effectively provide the results of the system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe recent hype surrounding the disruptive potential of AI technologies in the form of large language models or text to image generators also raises questions for geographical research and practice. These questions include the power relations and inequalities inscribed in these systems, their significance for work and labor relations, their ecological and economic impact, but also the geographical and spatial imaginaries they reproduce. This article focuses on the latter and formulates a series of theoretical and methodological considerations for dealing with the output of these systems. As we assume that outputs generated by large language models will play an increasing role in the future, both in public and media discourses as well as in the discourses and practices of spatial planning and economic policy making, we consider it important to gain a critical understanding of these socio-technical systems. The empirical object of investigation of this paper is generated output that deals with questions of regional development and economic challenges in three European regions that are currently particularly affected by the transition to a climate-neutral economy and are designated by the European Union as Just Transition Fund Territories. We are particularly interested in how geographical imaginaries about these regions are formulated, how economic and social problems of these regions are presented and how this is translated into planning advice and development plans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAI-powered language tools (AILTs) are commonly used by university students, yet there is a limited understanding of how students utilise and perceive these tools in everyday academic communication practice. Employing a post-humanist lens and based on over 1700 open-ended comments from a nationwide student survey, this qualitative study examined students' lived AILT experiences to explicate the impact of AILTs on academic communication in higher education learning and assessment. Thematic analysis of the data shows that students' academic writing is realised by assemblages of distributed spatial and personal linguistic repertoires, underscoring AILT's role in enhancing students' communicative performance and personal language development. AILTs are also conducive to transforming the academic writing process into an additional learning space. Students have developed a new identity as spatially advised learners, enabling them to assert their agency in terms of language development and subject-content knowledge while also holding critical perspectives on the limitations of AI. Furthermore, the findings point to divergent and eclectic student viewpoints on the ethical concerns of AILTs in assessment in the absence of university instructions. The study discusses implications for university policymaking and pedagogy in developing teaching and assessment methods that match students' stances and needs in AI-mediated academic communication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSemi open-ended multipart questions consist of multiple sub questions within a single question, requiring students to provide certain factual information while allowing them to express their opinion within a defined context. Human grading of such questions can be tedious, constrained by the marking scheme and susceptible to the subjective judgement of instructors. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has significantly advanced the prospect of automatic grading in educational settings. This paper introduces a topic-based grading approach that harnesses LLM capabilities alongside a refined marking scheme to ensure fair and explainable assessment processes. The proposed approach involves segmenting student responses according to sub questions, extracting topics utilizing LLM, and refining the marking scheme in consultation with instructors. The refined marking scheme is derived from LLM-extracted topics, validated by instructors to augment the original grading criteria. Leveraging LLM, we match student responses with refined marking scheme topics and employ a Python program to assign marks based on the matches. Various prompt versions are compared using relevant metrics to determine the most effective prompts. We evaluate LLM's grading proficiency through three approaches: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and our proposed method. Results indicate that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods fall short compared to human grading, the proposed approach achieves the best performance (highest percentage of exact match marks, lowest mean absolute error, highest Spearman correlation, highest Cohen's weighted kappa) and closely mirrors the distribution observed in human grading. Specifically, the collaborative approach enhances the grading process by refining the marking scheme to student responses, improving transparency and explainability through topic-based matching, and significantly increasing the effectiveness of LLMs when combined with instructor input, rather than as standalone automated grading systems.",

Despite advances in AI technology, challenges persist in capturing the nuances of humor and cultural references, which are essential for effective humor translation. A group of cinephiles was provided with humor dialogues translated using both GPT-4-generated and human translations and were then asked to fill out a questionnaire evaluating five constructs: quality, comprehension, enjoyment, perception, and suggestions for improvement. The results indicate that GPT-4-generated translations can offer an equivalent or superior viewer experience to human translations. However, the results also highlight the potential of GPT-4-generated translation in humor translation and emphasize the need to refine AI algorithms, foster collaboration between AI and human translators, and establish quality standards for AI-generated translations based on audience preferences and evolving trends in humor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nData-driven predictive maintenance (PM) is an approach that leverages advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and sensor data to predict when equipment failure might occur, and to perform maintenance just in time to prevent it, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. In manufacturing, one of the biggest potential applications for intelligent PM systems is tool condition monitoring (TCM). TCM aims to monitor tool wear in real-time, ensuring the quality of the manufactured products and the safety of the surrounding people and equipment. In recent decades, many studies have been carried out on tool condition monitoring for different machining operations such as milling, drilling or turning, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of various AI algorithms. Recent advances in hardware have made it possible for edge devices to run complex AI algorithms locally. This technology is called Edge AI. The Edge AI approach has several key benefits such as reduced latency, scalability, data privacy and security that can accelerate the integration of the PM solution for TCM at the production level. This paper presents the design of an Edge AI system for tool condition monitoring, consisting of state-of-the-art, low-cost components and using open-source software. Based on the proposed design, a prototype was built and tested during milling process. Four machine learning (ML) models and one deep learning (DL) model were run on a low performance edge device. Their predictions were validated. Challenges faced in the implementation are concluded along with directions and suggestions for future research.",

Thirty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with buyers and suppliers of AI marketing solutions to investigate the consequences of AI âdark forcesâ on B2B relationships. We posit AI as a new actor that has blurred the lines of the actors-resources-activities model. Findings show AI is now considered a new actor within B2B networks wielding dark force consequences such as algorithmic gatekeeping, which initiates dehumanization effects. In addition, AI is reliant on access to datasets which drives up resource costs. A lack of accountability of AI marketing solutions leads to opportunistic behaviours compromising actor relationships. Our conceptual model maps our understanding of the dark force consequences underpinning theoretical and managerial implications and recommendations for increased awareness and mitigation of dark forces.",

The underlying theoretical models are situation awareness and technology acceptance to predict user acceptance, trust, and satisfaction. To illustrate the merits of the model, this paper presents an exemplary application in the HR domain.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFor small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the planning of manual assembly activities represents a significant cost and resource factor, requiring precision and meticulous organization. To ensure a stable competitive and economical production, the steps involved in manual assembly must be optimized. In todayâs digital era, Artificial Intelligences (AI) offer innovative approaches and opportunities to streamline processes. In addition to LLM AIs, AI image generators are currently attracting a lot of attention as they generate very realistic and detailed images based on a given description. Images or visualisations of the situation are often used to make work instructions in manual assembly easier to understand. AI image generators can be used to visualise assembly process steps for automatically generated work instructions. In this research, a quantitative measure is proposed that can be used to rate how correctly the actual situation is depicted by highlighting incorrect or false objects and operations and assessing the accuracy of the context. The measure is validated by qualitatively evaluating images created with DALL-E 3 in an user study by both workers and planning experts from industry and comparing them with the quantitative measure. This will enable further research in the field of automated work planning and the comparison of different AI image generation tools for use in assembly planning.",

A mobile app was developed to integrate AI-based image quality analysis into clinical workflow. An expert radiologist provided reference decisions. Diagnostic performance parameters (sensitivity and specificity) were calculated and inter-reader agreement was evaluated.\nResults\nFully automated evaluation was possible in 87% of cases, with the application reaching a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100% in selecting patients for multiparametric MRI. In 2% of patients, the application falsely decided on omitting DCE. With a technician reaching a sensitivity of 29% and specificity of 98%, and resident radiologists reaching sensitivity of 29% and specificity of 93%, the use of the application allowed a significant increase in sensitivity.\nConclusion\nThe presented AI application accurately decides on a patient-specific MRI protocol based on image quality analysis, potentially allowing omission of DCE in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected prostate cancer. This could streamline workflow and optimize time utilization of healthcare professionals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this essay, we contribute to the limited literature that has critically examined the potential implications of generative AI on the accounting academy and accounting education (AE). We argue that the recent accelerated growth of AI, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raises significant issues and challenges that the accounting academy needs to urgently address to survive in the long term. Developments in AI have, we suggest, created a âchange-inducing crisisâ, presenting a unique opportunity for accounting academics to address the uncritical and problematic functionalist view of the discipline and the technical reductionism of accounting. Our arguments represent a call for action to embrace AI in learning and teaching practices in a way that brings about a renewed focus on the human dimension of accounting, incorporating broader social and critical perspectives, thereby addressing longstanding calls for change in AE to move beyond the technical, managerial, and financial focus (core of the AE curriculum) that has dominated the discipline for many decades. Accounting academics have a fundamental role to play in recognising the nature of the threats and the associated challenge of AI and to seize the opportunities available in ways that bring both critique and being critical to the fore. However, to bring about the sort of change we argue for in this essay, the accounting academy has to lead to âtake education back from the marketâ and provide the impetus that can make accounting education more relevant to our students and the needs of contemporary society.",

This study underscores the profound impact of Artificial Intelligence in conditioned agricultural practices within greenhouses, based on data from an agricultural competition where teams optimized greenhouse performance using Artificial Intelligence-driven mechanisms. Results indicate that Artificial Intelligence-enhanced control strategies can drastically reduce energy consumption, particularly heating loads, without compromising crop yield, quality, or profitability. In some instances, performance even surpassed conventional methods. However, there are areas like Carbon Dioxide emissions and water usage where enhancements are still essential. Building on these insights, the study further ventures into AI's potential to predict greenhouse production outcomes. Through rigorous assessment of various machine learning models, the Radial Basis Function model exhibited commendable performance, achieving an Root Mean Squared Error of 0.8 and an R-squared value of 0.98 post-optimization. This establishes the feasibility of precisely forecasting greenhouse production rates in terms of kg/m2. While this research predominantly centers on production volume, it lays a strong foundation for the predictive potential of AI in greenhouse operations and underlines the benefits of input optimization. It paves the way for future research focused on both the quality and quantity of greenhouse production.",

Teaching these indicators is conventionally accomplished through verbal lecturing using mathematical equations, accompanied by presentation graphics and tabular information representing the company's operational, financial, and strategic achievements. The conventional teaching method enables the student to understand what a KPI means and how it is calculated, however, it does not enable the student to understand easily how to interpret it. Here, a hybrid fuzzy-crisp rule-based AI system is presented and its effectiveness when applied with a group of management and organization students at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, during the 2022/2023 academic year is evaluated. The potential of this tool is reflected in its ability to simulate adaptive and realistic business economic situations, its high interactivity and user-friendly interface, and intuitive graphical and tabular results that are easy to interpret enhanced with natural-language-inference-explanations. Univariate analysis along with some complementary statistical tests was used to examine students' satisfaction with the system and to distinguish between students who used the system, and students who attended conventional classes, both in terms of acquiring knowledge and retaining knowledge. In general, the results showed high students' satisfaction with the system. The scores obtained by the former group on the objective knowledge assessment test were on average significantly higher compared to those of the latter, proving the positive effect of the hybrid fuzzy-crisp rule-based AI teaching approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGlobal CO2 emissions have been an essential topic of the environmental discussion. Still, empirical data is needed to support arguments that high-quality government actions could reduce these emissions. By analyzing data from 137 nations from 2000 to 2020, we offer strong evidence that state policies focused on promoting healthy ecosystems, sustainable economic growth, and transcendent legislative changes are capable of decreasing CO2 emissions. Based on our findings, there are essentially three critical institutional factors that need to be improved for environmental policies to be efficient: the concept of law, which protects citizens' intellectual property rights; citizens' speech, which allows them to participate in elections and represent themselves freely, and the management of corruption. Policies aimed at promoting economic growth, lowering oil and gas use, enhancing the usage of green energy by the public and private sectors, and enhancing such institutional factors are all necessary components of a climate-friendly financial strategy.",

To achieve this, organizations are required to embed trustworthiness and transparency in these systems, with human overseeing and accountability. Autonomous systems gain trustworthiness, transparency, quality, and maintainability through the assurance of outcomes, explanations of behavior, and interpretations of intent. However, technical, commercial, and market challenges during the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of autonomous systems can lead to compromises in their quality, maintainability, interpretability and explainability. This paper conceptually models transformation of SDLC to enable affordances for assurance, explanations, interpretations, and overall governance in autonomous systems. We argue that opportunities for transformation of SDLC are available through concerted interventions such as technical debt management, shift-left approach and non-ephemeral artifacts. This paper contributes to the theory and practice of governance of autonomous systems, and in building trustworthiness incrementally and hierarchically.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (318KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nTransformation through interventions across SDLC of Autonomous System.",

    "abstract": "Medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more and more common in healthcare. This has created a huge need for advanced predictive health modeling strategies that can make good use of the growing amount of multimodal data to find potential health risks early and help individuals in a personalized way. Existing methods, while useful, have limitations in predictive accuracy, delay, personalization, and user interpretability, requiring a more comprehensive and efficient approach to harness modern medical IoT devices. MAIPFE is a multimodal approach integrating pre-emptive analysis, personalized feature selection, and explainable AI for real-time health monitoring and disease detection. By using AI for early disease detection, personalized health recommendations, and transparency, healthcare will be transformed. The Multimodal Approach Integrating Pre-emptive Analysis, Personalized Feature Selection, and Explainable AI (MAIPFE) framework, which combines Firefly Optimizer, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Fuzzy C Means (FCM), and Explainable AI, improves disease detection precision over existing methods. Comprehensive metrics show the modelâs superiority in real-time health analysis. The proposed framework outperformed existing models by 8.3% in disease detection classification precision, 8.5% in accuracy, 5.5% in recall, 2.9% in specificity, 4.5% in AUC (Area Under the Curve), and 4.9% in delay reduction. Disease prediction precision increased by 4.5%, accuracy by 3.9%, recall by 2.5%, specificity by 3.5%, AUC by 1.9%, and delay levels decreased by 9.4%. MAIPFE can revolutionize healthcare with preemptive analysis, personalized health insights, and actionable recommendations. The research shows that this innovative approach improves patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency in the real world.",

Currently, a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalog and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.\nSummary\nThe utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, bringing forth numerous benefits and conveniences. However, this expansion has also provoked ethical concerns, such as privacy breaches, algorithmic discrimination, security and reliability issues, transparency, and other unintended consequences. To determine whether a global consensus exists regarding the ethical principles that should govern AI applications and to contribute to the formation of future regulations, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical guidelines for AI usage published by public bodies, academic institutions, private companies, and civil society organizations worldwide. We identified at least 17 resonating principles prevalent in the policies and guidelines of our dataset, released as an open source database and tool. We present the limitations of performing a global-scale analysis study paired with a critical analysis of our findings, presenting areas of consensus that should be incorporated into future regulatory efforts.",

The engine was implemented using the Javascript programming language and the WebGL 2.0 graphics library/API. It is targeted at web-based games/simulations. Components and subsystems include physics, audio, math, rendering, and AI (based on finite-state machines). The FSM-based AI subsystem is a solution aimed at reducing the ambiguity and performance hits associated with creating 2D game AI in the naive approach. The AI subsystem creates an interface for 2D games to be created with a common paradigm, and simulated with a great level of realism. The state machine used in this study is used to represent a variety of behaviours, such as wandering, attacking, and fleeing. The following conclusions were drawn as regards the impact of the AI approach used on rendering performance; the naive approach to implementing game AI is also compared with the FSM approach in terms of rendering (frames per second/ FPS, or frame rate). With the naive approach (vector math) being used to implement AI, there was a drop in the rendering frame rate to 50 FPS. The FSM approach didnât affect the frame rate, which is usually at 60FPS. With a well-developed FSM (Finite State Machine), game agents can transition between states easily as a response to user input or stimulus from the game environment. The proposed method was tested by creating a prototype game with the 2D game engine. The prototype game was a straightforward side-scrolling platformer featuring a cast of non-player characters (NPCs). This approach to implementing 2D game AI goes a long way toward improving performance and mitigating ambiguity in the code.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDiagnostic errors impact patient health and healthcare costs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in mitigating this burden by supporting Medical Doctors in decision-making. However, the mere display of excellent or even superhuman performance by AI in specific tasks does not guarantee a positive impact on medical practice. Effective AI assistance should target the primary causes of human errors and foster effective collaborative decision-making with human experts who remain the ultimate decision-makers. In this narrative review, we apply these principles to the specific scenario of AI assistance during colonoscopy. By unraveling the neurocognitive foundations of the colonoscopy procedure, we identify multiple bottlenecks in perception, attention, and decision-making that contribute to diagnostic errors, shedding light on potential interventions to mitigate them. Furthermore, we explored how existing AI devices fare in clinical practice and whether they achieved an optimal integration with the human decision-maker. We argue that to foster optimal Human-AI collaboration, future research should expand our knowledge of factors influencing AI's impact, establish evidence-based cognitive models, and develop training programs based on them. These efforts will enhance human-AI collaboration, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. The principles illuminated in this review hold more general value, extending their relevance to a wide array of medical procedures and beyond.",

With this view in mind, the author of the paper analyses recent legislative changes in the domain of data protection such as General Data Protection Regulation. Additionally, the need for legislative changes is highlighted in the light of ever increasing adoption of AI-based solutions in all types of organisations. Then, the research focus pertains to contemporary threats to data security in Polish SMEs, with a particular stress on the latest AI-based attacks. For this purpose data from national cybersecurity institutions are analysed to determine the most serious attacks aimed at Polish organisations. This is followed by the analysis of the defence potential of the investigated enterprises in terms of financial funds they spend on cybersecurity as well as persons in these organisations responsible for handling data protection issues. The next part of the paper is an analysis of the benefits stemming from application of AI-based tools in the cybersecurity domain. Its main objective is to find out the answer to the research question: What benefits stemming from application AI-based solutions can encourage Polish SMEs to make investments into these cybersecurity tools given their size and budget capacities)? The paper finishes with the conclusion and indication of potential further research avenues.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAs large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly integrated into different aspects of health care, questions about the implications for medical academic literature have begun to emerge. Key aspects such as authenticity in academic writing are at stake with artificial intelligence (AI) generating highly linguistically accurate and grammatically sound texts.\nObjective\nThe objective of this study is to compare human-written with AI-generated scientific literature in orthopedics and sports medicine.\nMethods\nFive original abstracts were selected from the PubMed database. These abstracts were subsequently rewritten with the assistance of 2 LLMs with different degrees of proficiency. Subsequently, researchers with varying degrees of expertise and with different areas of specialization were asked to rank the abstracts according to linguistic and methodological parameters. Finally, researchers had to classify the articles as AI generated or human written.\nResults\nNeither the researchers nor the AI-detection software could successfully identify the AI-generated texts. Furthermore, the criteria previously suggested in the literature did not correlate with whether the researchers deemed a text to be AI generated or whether they judged the article correctly based on these parameters.\nConclusions\nThe primary finding of this study was that researchers were unable to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written texts. However, due to the small sample size, it is not possible to generalize the results of this study. As is the case with any tool used in academic research, the potential to cause harm can be mitigated by relying on the transparency and integrity of the researchers. With scientific integrity at stake, further research with a similar study design should be conducted to determine the magnitude of this issue.",

It also briefly reviews future research and how these methods could be used as a part of OA management.\nResults\nAI algorithms have proven highly effective in recognizing the subtle changes in joint tissues associated with OA and in identifying patients at high risk for the disease. While these automated tools facilitate early diagnosis, they typically do not provide personalized intervention strategies to prevent disease progression. AI-enhanced biomechanical modeling has the potential to simulate the effects of various conservative interventions (e.g., weight management, optimal footwear, and gait retraining) on slowing OA progression, which could be pivotal for patient engagement and preventive care.\nConclusions\nThe integration of AI with biomechanical modeling holds significant promise for enhancing the management of OA by not only predicting disease onset and progression but also by enabling personalized intervention plans. Future research should focus on the development of these models to include personalized, preventive strategies that could effectively engage patients and potentially delay or prevent the onset of OA. This approach could revolutionize patient care by making early, targeted intervention feasible.",

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks.\nObjective\nThis study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools.\nMethods\nWe used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews.\nResults\nA triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes.\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model.",

The disease can be successfully treated if detected early, but the survival rate drops significantly for late stage cases. There is a growing interest in a shift from the current standard of invasive and time-consuming tissue sampling and histological examination, towards non-invasive brush biopsies and cytological examination, facilitating continued risk group monitoring. For cost effective and accurate cytological analysis there is a great need for reliable computer-assisted data-driven approaches. However, infeasibility of accurate cell-level annotation hinders model performance, and limits evaluation and interpretation of the results. This study aims to improve AI-based oral cancer detection by introducing additional information through multimodal imaging and deep multimodal information fusion.\nMethods:\nWe combine brightfield and fluorescence whole slide microscopy imaging to analyze Papanicolaou-stained liquid-based cytology slides of brush biopsies collected from both healthy and cancer patients. Given the challenge of detailed cytological annotations, we utilize a weakly supervised deep learning approach only relying on patient-level labels. We evaluate various multimodal information fusion strategies, including early, late, and three recent intermediate fusion methods.\nResults:\nOur experiments demonstrate that: (i) there is substantial diagnostic information to gain from fluorescence imaging of Papanicolaou-stained cytological samples, (ii) multimodal information fusion improves classification performance and cancer detection accuracy, compared to single-modality approaches. Intermediate fusion emerges as the leading method among the studied approaches. Specifically, the Co-Attention Fusion Network (CAFNet) model achieves impressive results, with an F1 score of 83.34% and an accuracy of 91.79% at cell level, surpassing human performance on the task. Additional tests highlight the importance of accurate image registration to maximize the benefits of the multimodal analysis.\nConclusion:\nThis study advances the field of cytopathology by integrating deep learning methods, multimodal imaging and information fusion to enhance non-invasive early detection of oral cancer. Our approach not only improves diagnostic accuracy, but also allows an efficient, yet uncomplicated, clinical workflow. The developed pipeline has potential applications in other cytological analysis settings. We provide a validated open-source analysis framework and share a unique multimodal oral cancer dataset to support further research and innovation.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (317KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Using techniques like image enhancement, restoration, and segmentation are able to extract pertinent information from images and use it for task execution and decision-making. However, the hardware implementation of these algorithms demands more delay, area, and power. This work proposes a new mantissa bit-size reduced half-precision floating-point format for processing and characterizing image pixels for machine learning algorithms. In the realm of imaging, lowering the mantissa bit-size in floating-point can conserve area and power when utilized for internal calculations. Together with the area-power reduction, there is also a progressive reduction in image quality. For any image application, it becomes necessary to monitor the area and power trade-offs related to the amount of bits used to process the raw data. This work assists in selecting the bit-size for internal computations based on the accuracy requirements of the application by reporting the area, and power for various bit size reductions. The updated pixel values after applying the mantissa bit-size reduction are displayed in this study, along with a theoretical explanation of its inaccuracy. Since multipliers and adders are needed for the majority of mathematical equations in machine learning image algorithms, they are developed later in this work to process the image. The processed image is based on various adjusted pixel values, and the experimental findings demonstrate 75.2% to 21.3% area optimization, and 66.43% to 20.4% power optimization. However, determining the PSNR and MSE values of the processed image allows for quality validation.",

Individuals grapple with the peril of untimely demise from diverse ailments as patients suffer from delayed treatment. The paramount objective is to forge a dependable patient care system utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling physicians to monitor patients' well-being within medical facilities or even the confines of their homes. The system aids in tracking the patient's SpO2 level, body temperature, pulse rate (beats per minute), room temperature, and humidity, then trains the data with machine learning algorithms for the patient and finally monitors it through the Blynk IoT system. The cloud-stored data can be harnessed to ascertain and supervise one's health and predict forthcoming perils. This study unveils an efficacious decision-making model custom-tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) ventures, and the proposed trained algorithm satiates these requirements, offering efficiency and precision, rendering it appropriate for numerous IoT applications. Finally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is used here for finding out the most influential parameters, and Explainable AI (XAI) is utilized with the help of SHAP values for enhanced information on affecting parameters. The SVC model's hyperparameter is properly adjusted, yielding a testing accuracy of 98.83 % and a training accuracy of 98.71 %. On cross-validation, the lightweight Sklearn model achieved a mean accuracy of almost 99 %. And with a SHAP weightage magnitude of 1.38, 0.91, and 0.44 for Class âGoodâ, Class âPoorâ, and Class âBadâ, respectively, patients SpO2 level is the most significant feature.",

The ability to efficiently extract key clinical information from a large volume of data in electronic health records (EHR) can improve understanding about the extent of the problem and developing effective interventions. This research aimed to test the efficacy of zero-shot prompt engineering applied to generative artificial intelligence (AI) models on their own and in combination with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), for the automating tasks of summarizing both structured and unstructured data in EHR and extracting important malnutrition information.\nMethodology\nWe utilized Llama 2 13B model with zero-shot prompting. The dataset comprises unstructured and structured EHRs related to malnutrition management in 40 Australian RACFs. We employed zero-shot learning to the model alone first, then combined it with RAG to accomplish two tasks: generate structured summaries about the nutritional status of a client and extract key information about malnutrition risk factors. We utilized 25 notes in the first task and 1,399 in the second task. We evaluated the modelâs output of each task manually against a gold standard dataset.\nResult\nThe evaluation outcomes indicated that zero-shot learning applied to generative AI model is highly effective in summarizing and extracting information about nutritional status of RACFsâ clients. The generated summaries provided concise and accurate representation of the original data with an overall accuracy of 93.25%. The addition of RAG improved the summarization process, leading to a 6% increase and achieving an accuracy of 99.25%. The model also proved its capability in extracting risk factors with an accuracy of 90%. However, adding RAG did not further improve accuracy in this task. Overall, the model has shown a robust performance when information was explicitly stated in the notes; however, it could encounter hallucination limitations, particularly when details were not explicitly provided.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates the high performance and limitations of applying zero-shot learning to generative AI models to automatic generation of structured summarization of EHRs data and extracting key clinical information. The inclusion of the RAG approach improved the model performance and mitigated the hallucination problem.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (135KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Buildings, especially commercial and industrial ones, are major consumers of energy. Implementing AI-powered solutions can help monitor, predict, and reduce energy usage, leading to substantial cost savings and more efficient energy use. Integrating Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) into smart buildings presents a significant opportunity for enhancing energy management through advanced technologies. The increasing demand for energy in urban areas necessitates the development of more efficient energy management strategies, particularly within smart buildings, which are significant energy consumers. This study proposes an AI-powered deep learning framework utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance energy management in smart buildings, leveraging the ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III dataset. The proposed framework leverages deep learning techniques to analyze historical energy data, weather conditions, and building characteristics to forecast future energy usage accurately. Additionally, the framework includes anomaly detection mechanisms to identify inefficiencies and faults in the energy management system. By optimizing energy consumption in real-time and implementing demand response strategies, the framework aims to reduce energy costs and enhance the overall efficiency of smart buildings. The proposed CNN-IoT-based energy management framework in smart buildings demonstrates significant advancements over existing methods, achieving an accuracy of 88â¯%. These performance metrics indicate a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches such as SVM, ELM, and LSTM.",

Therefore, it is essential that the AI literacy of individuals can be assessed in a valid and reliable way. This study presents the development of the âScale for the assessment of non-experts' AI literacyâ (SNAIL). An existing AI literacy item set was distributed as an online questionnaire to a heterogeneous group of non-experts (i.e., individuals without a formal AI or computer science education). Based on the data collected, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the underlying latent factor structure. The results indicated that a three-factor model had the best model fit. The individual factors reflected AI competencies in the areas of âTechnical Understandingâ, âCritical Appraisalâ, and âPractical Applicationâ. In addition, eight items from the original questionnaire were deleted based on high intercorrelations and low communalities to reduce the length of the questionnaire. The final SNAIL-questionnaire consists of 31 items that can be used to assess the AI literacy of individual non-experts or specific groups and is also designed to enable the evaluation of AI literacy coursesâ teaching effectiveness.",

The dataset used to train the model includes 37.8 million single-point energies, 11.7 billion force pairs, and 340.2 million stresses. We also demonstrated that the GPTFF can be universally used to simulate various physical systems, such as crystal structure optimization, phase transition simulations, and mass transport.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a âBrussels effectâ in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries.\nAgainst this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality.\nHence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework.\nThird, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general.\nFurthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI).\nFinally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nVarious components of organisational AI capability are crucial to ensure AI's successful development and use, yet are not always readily available for public administrations.\nâ¢\nThe findings note a distinction in the capability to develop, and the capability to implement AI technology in public administrations.\nâ¢\nThere is a strong complementarity between historical e-Government development and the organisational capability to use AI technologies.\nâ¢\nThere are emerging organisational configurations to balance the AI expertise available externally and internally within public administrations.\nâ¢\nAI capability is dynamic in public organisations, as the lack of structural and sustained resources could leave the AI capability fragile and temporary.\nAbstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in public administration are gaining increasing attention due to the potential benefits they can provide in improving governmental operations. However, translating technological opportunities into concrete public value for public administrations is still limited. One of the factors hindering this progress is the lack of AI capability within public organisations. The research found that various components of AI capability are essential for successfully developing and using AI technologies, including tangible, intangible, and human-related factors. There is a distinction between the AI capability to develop and the AI capability to implement AI technologies, with more administrations capable of the former but finding difficulties in the latter. A lack of in-house technical expertise to maintain and update the AI systems, legal challenges in deploying developed AI systems, and the capability to introduce changes in the organisation to ensure the system remains operational and used by relevant end-users are among the most critical limiting factors for long-term use of AI by public administrations. The research underlines the strong complementarity between historical eGovernment developments and the capability to deploy AI technologies. The study suggests that funding alone may not be enough to acquire AI capability, and public administrations need to focus on both the capability to develop and implement AI technologies. The research emphasizes that human skillsets, both technical and non-technical, are essential for the successful implementation of AI in public administration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a known complication following patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. AI-enabled ECG (AI-ECG) acquired during normal sinus rhythm has been shown to identify individuals with AF by noting high-risk ECG features invisible to the human eye. We sought to characterize the value of AI-ECG in predicting AF development following PFO closure and investigate key clinical and procedural characteristics possibly associated with post-procedural AF.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent PFO closure at our hospital from January 2011 to December 2022. We recorded the probability (%) of AF using the Mayo Clinic AI-ECG dashboard from pre- and post-procedure ECGs. The cut-off point of â¥ 11 %, which was found to optimally balance sensitivity and specificity in the original derivation paper (the Youden index) was used to label an AI-ECG âpositiveâ for AF. Pre-procedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and pre- and post-procedure transcranial doppler (TCD) data was also recorded.\nResults\nOut of 93 patients, 49 (53 %) were male, mean age was 55 Â± 15 years with mean post-procedure follow up of 29 Â± 3 months. Indication for PFO closure in 69 (74 %) patients was for secondary prevention of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and/or stroke. Twenty patients (22 %) developed paroxysmal AF post-procedure, with the majority within the first month post-procedure (15 patients, 75 %). Patients who developed AF were not significantly more likely to have a positive post-procedure AI-ECG than those who did not develop AF (30 % AF vs 27 % no AF, p = 0.8).\nBased on the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification, patients who had PFO closure for secondary prevention of TIA and/or stroke in the âpossibleâ group were significantly more likely to develop AF than patients in âprobableâ and âunlikelyâ groups (p = 0.034). AF-developing patients were more likely to have post-procedure implantable loop recorder (ILR) (55 % vs 9.6 %, p < 0.001), and longer duration of ILR monitoring (121 vs 92.5 weeks, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in TCD and TEE characteristics, device type, or device size between those who developed AF vs those who did not.\nConclusions\nIn this small, retrospective study, AI-ECG did not accurately distinguish patients who developed AF post-PFO closure from those who did not. Although AI-ECG has emerged as a valuable tool for risk prediction of AF, extrapolation of its performance to procedural settings such as PFO closure requires further investigation.",

It seeks an answer the question whether content ranking algorithms could count as high-risk systems under the Act? It examines the possibility of later inclusion into the list of high-risk systems by Commission action. Then, it compares the envisioned obligations of high-risk systems with those provided by the Digital Services Act. The article puts forward arguments that content ranking algorithms should be subjected to strict ethical requirements due to their impact on the democratic public discourse, and therefore indirectly, democracy.",

    "abstract": "In the current landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, the utilization of deep learning in medical imaging, especially in chest computed tomography (CT) scan analysis for virus detection, has become increasingly significant. Despite its potential, deep learningâs âblack boxâ nature has been a major impediment to its broader acceptance in clinical environments, where transparency in decision-making is imperative. To bridge this gap, our research integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method, with advanced deep learning models. This integration forms a sophisticated and transparent framework for COVID-19 identification, enhancing the capability of standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models through transfer learning and data augmentation. Our approach leverages the refined DenseNet201 architecture for superior feature extraction and employs data augmentation strategies to foster robust model generalization. The pivotal element of our methodology is the use of LIME, which demystifies the AI decision-making process, providing clinicians with clear, interpretable insights into the AIâs reasoning. This unique combination of an optimized Deep Neural Network (DNN) with LIME not only elevates the precision in detecting COVID-19 cases but also equips healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the diagnostic process. Our method, validated on the SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan dataset, demonstrates exceptional diagnostic accuracy, with performance metrics that reinforce its potential for seamless integration into modern healthcare systems. This innovative approach marks a significant advancement in creating explainable and trustworthy AI tools for medical decision-making in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

A panel of 3 retinal specialists independently evaluated responses on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 based on their relevance, accuracy, and adherence to AAO PPP guidelines. Response readability was evaluated using Flesch Readability Ease and Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores.\nResults\nChatGPT achieved an overall average score of 4.9/5.0, suggesting high alignment with the AAO PPP guidelines. Scores varied across domains, with the lowest in the surgical management of disease. The responses had a low reading ease score and required a college-to-graduate level of comprehension. Identified errors were related to diagnostic criteria, treatment options, and methodological procedures.\nConclusion\nChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated significant potential in generating guideline-concordant responses, particularly for common medical retinal diseases. However, its performance slightly decreased in surgical retina, highlighting the ongoing need for clinician input, further model refinement, and improved comprehensibility.",

One method proposed remedy is analogical reasoning (AR), which utilizes abductive reasoning to draw inferences on an unfamiliar scenario given knowledge about a similar familiar scenario. Currently, applications of visual AR gravitate toward analogy-formatted image problems rather than real-world computer vision data sets. This paper proposes the Image Recognition Through Analogical Reasoning Algorithm (IRTARA) and its âgenerative AIâ version called âGIRTARAâ which describes and predicts out-of-library visual objects. IRTARA characterizes the out-of-library object through a list of words called the âterm frequency listâ. GIRTARA uses the term frequency list to predict what the out-of-library object is. To evaluate the quality of the results of IRTARA, both quantitative and qualitative assessments are used, including a baseline to compare the automated methods with human-generated results. The accuracy of GIRTARAâs predictions is calculated through a cosine similarity analysis. This study observed that IRTARA had consistent results in the term frequency list based on the three evaluation methods for the high-quality results and GIRTARA was able to obtain up to 65% match in terms of cosine similarity when compared to the out-of-library objectâs true labels.",

Noting the accountability challenges which these systems introduce, the paper posits the need for robust documentation and records capacities within these systems. The paper surveys four real-time AI systems with significant records needs: autonomous vehicles, online content targeting systems, mixed-reality tools for surgical contexts, and digital twin systems in airport facilities management. The paper identifies paradata, or the data leading up to an output in a system's operation, as a key data category necessitating preservation for full transparency in the records generated by these systems. Paradata is defined as âinformation about the procedure(s) and tools used to create and process information resources, along with information about the persons carrying out those procedures.â Paradata uncovers opaque technological processes underlying the production of other datasets and at a granular level must be identified and preserved to delineate the boundaries between human and system agency in semi-autonomous systems. With a basis in control theory, the paper finally offers a framework for assessing the functions of real-time AI systems' operations and their documentation and records needs.",

A questionnaire is missing that is deeply grounded in the existing literature on AI literacy, is modularly applicable depending on the goals, and includes further psychological competencies in addition to the typical facets of AIL. This paper presents the development and validation of a questionnaire considering the desiderata described above. We derived items to represent different facets of AI literacy and psychological competencies, such as problem-solving, learning, and emotion regulation in regard to AI. We collected data from 300 German-speaking adults to confirm the factorial structure. The result is the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS) for AI literacy with the facets Use & apply AI, Understand AI, Detect AI, and AI Ethics and the ability to Create AI as a separate construct, and AI Self-efficacy in learning and problem-solving and AI Self-management (i.e., AI persuasion literacy and emotion regulation). This study contributes to the research on AI literacy by providing a measurement instrument relying on profound competency models. Psychological competencies are included particularly important in the context of pervasive change through AI systems.",

Meanwhile, the technology is also often hailed a solution to key societal and environmental challenges. It raises questions regarding, for example, how we can and should deal with climate change. This article links and discusses these issues by putting them in the context of a technocracy-democracy dilemma and by using the concept of critical junctures. Then it identifies two political pathways of AI and critically discusses their underlying assumptions. This offers a useful framework for further discussion of the relations between AI, climate change, and democracy, and enables the examination of important issues for the politics of technology, such as the role of human expertise vis-Ã -vis artificial intelligence, the problems raised by techno-solutionism, and the question at what level of governance AI and climate change should be addressed.",

Employing an analysis of six leading B2B firms engaged in digital servitization, we conceptualize the perceptive, predictive, and prescriptive capacities of AI, which enhance resource efficiency by automating and augmenting data-driven analysis and decision making. We further identify two innovative classes of AI-enabled CBMs â augmentation (e.g., optimization solutions) and automation (e.g., autonomous solutions) business models â and their main circular value drivers. Finally, our research reveals novel dynamic capabilities underpinning the innovation of AI-enabled business models â value discovery, value realization, and value optimization capabilities â which enable manufacturers to make economic and sustainable values come to life in collaborating with customers and ecosystem partners. This study represents an important step in our understanding of how AI can drive circularity and sustainable innovation in industrial digital servitization. Overall, our study contributes to practice and the academic literature on AI, circular business models, and digital servitization by highlighting the potential of AI to empower CBMs for industrial manufacturers and the underlying processes of this digital transformation.",

However, many people who want to (and need to) work with AI may find the advent of this technology overwhelming, as they are not well prepared to do so. This paper aims to address organizational preparedness in the era of AI by introducing two major agendas of AI. Firstly, as a diagnosis of AI-related sentiments that inhibit working with AI, four types of \"AI-phobia\" are presented: AI-literacy, AI-substitutability, AI-accountability, and AI-implementability. Secondly, the paper outlines methods to address and overcome AI-phobia and effectively work with AI, by presenting a journey map that offers a systematic checklist for AI-related communication and decision-making in organizations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper investigates the comparative performance of artificial intelligence, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, and a professional human translator in translating Abai Kunanbayev's poem \"Spring\" from Kazakh into English. Abai, a prominent 19th-century Kazakh poet, philosopher, and cultural reformer, is famous for his deep reflections on nature, human nature, and society. His works are integral to Kazakh literature and present rich, nuanced content, making them ideal for assessing translation quality. Literary translation is inherently challenging, requiring not only linguistic accuracy but also the preservation of stylistic elements, cultural nuances, and emotional depth. Professional human translators bring a nuanced understanding and cultural context to their work, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the original text. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in translating \"Spring,\" focusing on linguistic accuracy, preservation of poetic style, and cultural relevance. The analysis involves a detailed comparative study between ChatGPT-4â²s translation and a professional human translation by Dorian Rottenberg. Key aspects of the translations, such as denotative and connotative meanings, preservation of stylistic devices, and handling of culture-specific items, are examined. The findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of current AI models in literary translation, suggesting that while AI offers significant potential, it may benefit from hybrid approaches that combine AI efficiency with human expertise. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in literary translation and informs future developments in AI translation technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe educational field is increasingly using solutions that support personal development. One is academic tutoring, which helps students search for career paths. Academic tutoring is a complex process that requires a lot of human resources. Technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), can support selected stages of this process, especially when matching appropriate tutors for tutees. This research aims to present the concept of enhancing academic tutoring with AI, especially at the stage of connecting tutor-tutee. The research was developed using a case study based on participant observation conducted at the Wroclaw University of Economics and Business (WUEB) and based on it, the process was visualized using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), indicating the current state of and elements of the process that could be improved. The use of AI solutions can enhance the efficiency of academic tutoring, starting with tools that analyze the content of submissions made by tutors and tutees. In addition, AI tools could also evaluate the results of tests such as Gallup and automatically match tutors and tutors based on these results. The designed procedure concept reduces the length of the process and, as a result, facilitates the work of academic tutoring program coordinators. It can also improve the match between tutor and tutee, leading to more effective collaboration and better tutee performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhen applying blockchain sharding technology in the building Internet of Things (IoT) domain to enhance the throughput performance of the blockchain, cross-shard transactions triggered by device collaborative tasks have increasingly become a prominent issue. Existing solutions base their shard division on historical transaction moments, using the outcomes for future transaction processing. However, since the historical interaction characteristics do not accurately reflect the interaction details within specific fine-grained time periods, this leads to poor system performance. Additionally, the parameter configuration in blockchain sharding systems is mostly based on arbitrary or default settings, which also results in unstable system performance. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain sharding scheme called AI-Shard. Firstly, the system includes a module, G-AI, that utilizes generative AI to predict future node interaction relationships, enabling more proactive and adaptive shard division based on the predicted interaction matrix. Secondly, the system integrates a reinforcement learning module, DL-AI, specifically tailored for configuring parameters of the blockchain sharding system, such as the number of shards, block size, and block interval, to automatically optimize them, aiming to further enhance the system's throughput. Experimental results show that AI-Shard can reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and improve the system's throughput.",

Despite the significant momentum recently gained by the FL paradigm, most of the existing approaches in the field neglect another key pillar for the trustworthiness of AI systems, namely explainability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for FL of fuzzy regression trees (FRTs), which are generally acknowledged as highly interpretable by-design models. The proposed FL procedure is designed for the scenario of horizontally partitioned data and is based on the transmission of aggregated statistics from the clients to a central server for the tree induction procedure. It is shown that the proposed approach faithfully approximates the ideal case in which the tree induction algorithm is applied on the union of all local datasets, while still ensuring privacy preservation. Furthermore, the FL approach brings benefits, in terms of generalization capability, compared to the local learning setting in which each participant learns its own FRT based only on the private, local, dataset. The adoption of linear models in the leaf nodes ensures a competitive level of performance, as assessed by an extensive experimental campaign on benchmark datasets. The analysis of the results covers both the aspects of accuracy and interpretability of FRT. Finally, we discuss the application of the proposed federated FRT to the task of Quality of Experience forecasting in an automotive case-study.",

Although the key group creating and realizing AI-related futures imaginaries are the technology practitioners who research, develop, and apply AI, empirical research has focused on collective rather than individually interpreted imaginaries. Empirical research on individual practitionersâ futures imaginaries is necessary, as well as fine-tuning the related vocabulary to support individual and non-linear perspectives. We present an empirical study in which we interviewed 35 AI and robotics practitioners based in Finland and Singapore. We asked (1) what kind of best and worst futures imaginaries the practitioners of AI and robots envision and (2) how the practitioners imagine likely futures will emerge. As a result, we present three continuums. Along these continuums, the practitioners consider variations of likely futures: (1) the best, (2) in between, and (3) the worst. Our analysis reveals decisive questions behind the continuums regarding the agent in control, relations in practitioner communities and society, and justified concentration of power.",

These losses have underscored the urgent need to improve public knowledge and advance existing techniques in wildfire management. Recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wildfires, propelled by the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning models, has created an unprecedented momentum to implement and develop more effective wildfire management. Although existing survey papers have explored learning-based approaches in wildfire, drone use in disaster management, and wildfire risk assessment, a comprehensive review emphasizing the application of AI-enabled UAV systems and investigating the role of learning-based methods throughout the overall workflow of multi-stage wildfire management, including pre-fire (e.g., vision-based vegetation fuel measurement), active-fire (e.g., fire growth modeling), and post-fire tasks (e.g., evacuation planning) is notably lacking. This survey synthesizes and integrates state-of-the-science reviews and research at the nexus of wildfire observations and modeling, AI, and UAVs â topics at the forefront of advances in wildfire management, elucidating the role of AI in performing monitoring and actuation tasks from pre-fire, through the active-fire stage, to post-fire management. To this aim, we provide an extensive analysis of the existing remote sensing systems with a particular focus on the UAV advancements, device specifications, and sensor technologies relevant to wildfire management. We also examine the pre-fire and post-fire management approaches, including fuel monitoring, prevention strategies, as well as evacuation planning, damage assessment, and operation strategies. Additionally, we review and summarize a wide range of computer vision techniques in active-fire management, with an emphasis on Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for wildfire classification, segmentation, detection, and monitoring tasks. Ultimately, we underscore the substantial advancement in wildfire modeling through the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques and UAV-based data, providing novel insights and enhanced predictive capabilities to understand dynamic wildfire behavior.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (383KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe European Commissionâs âFlightpath 2050â highlights the critical role of the design phase in complex aircraft development. Ensuring the aircraftâs functionality, particularly for certification, represents a significant proportion (around 50%) of the total development cost. The increasing complexity of the testing process presents challenges. For example, the creation of simulation models for HIL testing and the performance of exploratory tests for certification are becoming increasingly complex due to the growing complexity of aircraft design.\nTo address this challenge, this research aims to integrate AI modelling and data analysis into aircraft test processes as part of the design process. The aim is to develop a user-friendly modelling tool for test engineers without the need for data analyst expertise. The approach focuses on achieving seamless interoperability and easy integration of test-related data sources and AI models, eliminating the need for complex scripting in scripting languages such as Python or Matlab. To achieve this goal, a domain ontology and generic wrappers have been developed to map generic AI models to the TensorFlow and Matlab tools. At the same time, data sources are connected via a data integration tool.\nThe evaluation successfully demonstrates the ability to analyse the correlation between sensors in an experimental cooling system without understanding the data format of the data sources and without the scripting of the AI model to model and execute the AI models.",

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques provide data-driven approaches to unravel how clinical variables influence this decision-making. We applied global XAI techniques to examine the impact of key clinical decision-drivers when mapped by a machine learning (ML) model, on the likelihood of receiving different oesophageal cancer (OC) treatment modalities by the multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nMethods\nRetrospective analysis of 893 OC patients managed between 2010 and 2022 at our tertiary unit, used a random forests (RF) classifier to predict four possible treatment pathways as determined by the MDT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NACT + S), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (NACRT + S), surgery-alone, and palliative management. Variable importance and partial dependence (PD) analyses then examined the influence of targeted high-ranking clinical variables within the ML model on treatment decisions as a surrogate model of the MDT decision-making dynamic.\nResults\nAmongst guideline-variables known to determine treatments, such as Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging, age also proved highly important to the RF model (16.1 % of total importance) on variable importance analysis. PD subsequently revealed that predicted probabilities for all treatment modalities change significantly after 75 years (p < 0.001). Likelihood of surgery-alone and palliative therapies increased for patients aged 75â85yrs but lowered for NACT/NACRT. Performance status divided patients into two clusters which influenced all predicted outcomes in conjunction with age.\nConclusion\nXAI techniques delineate the relationship between clinical factors and OC treatment decisions. These techniques identify advanced age as heavily influencing decisions based on our model with a greater role in patients with specific tumour characteristics. This study methodology provides the means for exploring conscious/subconscious bias and interrogating inconsistencies in team-based decision-making within the era of AI-driven decision support.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGenetic markers for acne are being studied to create personalized treatments based on an individualâs genes, and the field is benefiting from the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. One such AI tool, the Q-learning algorithm, is increasingly being utilized by medical researchers to delve into the genetics of acne. In contrast to previous methods, our research introduces a Q-learning model that is adaptable to diverse sample groups. This innovative approach involves preprocessing data by identifying differentially expressed genes and constructing gene-gene connectivity networks. The key advantage of using the Q-learning model lies in its ability to transform acne gene data into Markovian domains, which are essential for selecting relevant genetic markers. Performance evaluations of our Q-learning model have shown high accuracy and specificity, although there may be some sensitivity variations. Notably, this research has identified specific genes, such as CD86, AGPAT3, TMPRSS11D, DSG3, TNFRSF1B, PI3, C5AR1, and KRT16, as being acne-related through biological verification and text data mining. These findings underscore the potential of AI-driven Q-learning models to revolutionize the study of acne genetics. In conclusion, our Q-learning model offers a promising approach for the selection of acne-related genetic markers, despite minor sensitivity fluctuations. This research highlights the transformative potential of Q-learning in advancing our understanding of the genetics underlying acne, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRefractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) and complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) are vital for high-temperature applications beyond the capabilities of Ni-based superalloys. Traditional methods for predicting oxidation resistance in these alloys are often inaccurate and resource-intensive. This study introduces a novel approach using Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), an artificial intelligence technique, to predict specific mass gain due to oxidation. Utilizing a dataset synthesized from extensive literature and characterized by diverse alloy compositions and oxidation conditions, the model was trained using Iterated Nested k-fold Cross Validation with Shuffling (INKCVS). Our findings demonstrate that the GBDT model achieves a good balance between accuracy and generalization capacity in predicting oxidation resistance, as validated experimentally with selected alloys. This approach not only enhances prediction accuracy but also significantly reduces the need for extensive experimental testing, facilitating rapid development of new high-performance materials.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (326KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Early research evaluating chatbots' ability to provide relationship advice and single-session relationship interventions has showed that both laypeople and relationship therapists rate them high on attributed such as empathy and helpfulness. In the present study, 20 participants engaged in single-session relationship intervention with ChatGPT and were interviewed about their experiences. We evaluated the performance of ChatGPT comprising of technical outcomes such as error rate and linguistic accuracy and therapeutic quality such as empathy and therapeutic questioning. The interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis which generated four themes: light at the end of the tunnel; clearing the fog; clinical skills; and therapeutic setting. The analyses of technical and feasibility outcomes, as coded by researchers and perceived by users, show ChatGPT provides realistic single-session intervention with it consistently rated highly on attributes such as therapeutic skills, human-likeness, exploration, and useability, and providing clarity and next steps for usersâ relationship problem. Limitations include a poor assessment of risk and reaching collaborative solutions with the participant. This study extends on AI acceptance theories and highlights the potential capabilities of ChatGPT in providing relationship advice and support.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTechniques from artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in forensic evidence evaluation and are currently applied in biometric fields. However, it is generally not possible to fully understand how and why these algorithms reach their conclusions. Whether and how we should include such âblack boxâ algorithms in this crucial part of the criminal law system is an open question that has not only scientific but also ethical, legal, and philosophical angles. Ideally, the question should be debated by people with diverse backgrounds.\nHere, we present a view on the question from the philosophy of science angle: computational reliabilism (CR). CR posits that we are justified in believing the output of an AI system, if we have grounds for believing its reliability. Under CR, these grounds are classified into âreliability indicatorsâ of three types: technical, scientific, and societal. This framework enables debates on the suitability of AI methods for forensic evidence evaluation that take a wider view than explainability and validation.\nWe argue that we are justified in believing the AI's output for forensic comparison of voices and forensic comparison of faces. Technical indicators include the validation of the AI algorithm in itself, validation of its application in the forensic setting, and case-based validation. Scientific indicators include the simple notion that we know faces and voices contain identifying information along with operationalizing well-established metrics and forensic practices. Societal indicators are the emerging scientific consensus on the use of these methods, as well as their application and interpretation by well-educated and certified practitioners. We expect expert witnesses to rely more on technical indicators to be justified in believing AIsystems, and triers-of-fact to rely more on societal indicators to believe the expert witness supported by the AIsystem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has been notable in supporting English as an Additional Language (EAL) learners, particularly in offering interactive assessments. AI-driven dialogue systems that produce culturally relevant humor and empathy, bridging the native language (L1) and the target language (L2), have been employed to engage EAL learners more effectively and boost their learning results. However, there's a noticeable gap in research concerning the fusion of humor, empathy, and intercultural dimensions in language learning. Intercultural dimensions encompass acquiring crucial knowledge, communication skills, and the values essential for meaningful interactions across cultures. This case study examines the effectiveness of an AI dialogue system, termed the Multidimensional Approach Culture, Humor, and Empathy Bot (MACHE-Bot), in elevating the English language learning experience and its potential to enhance EAL proficiency. Using convenience sampling, 37 individuals were selected from an English language learning group on Facebook. Following a two-week pilot study, semi-structured interviews were conducted. The results revealed that MACHE-Bot adeptly initiated and reciprocated with humor, empathy, and cultural nuances in a manner well-received by participants. Additionally, the study identified five pivotal factors in EAL learning with MACHE-Bot: (1) intercultural dimensions, which include culturally humorous interaction and culturally empathetic support; (2) user trust comprising both affective and cognitive elements; (3) anthropomorphism; (4) reciprocal self-disclosure; and (5) higher engagement and motivation. These five factors collectively contribute to creating an engaging, relatable, and supportive learning environment, facilitating a more natural learning process, and fostering a deeper learner-bot connection, thereby potentially enhancing motivation and investment in the learning process.",

This position paper shares the results of the international conference âFair medicine and AIâ (online 3â5 March 2021). Scholars from science and technology studies (STS), gender studies, and ethics of science and technology formulated opportunities, challenges, and research and development desiderata for AI in healthcare. AI systems and solutions, which are being rapidly developed and applied, may have undesirable and unintended consequences including the risk of perpetuating health inequalities for marginalized groups. Socially robust development and implications of AI in healthcare require urgent investigation. There is a particular dearth of studies in human-AI interaction and how this may best be configured to dependably deliver safe, effective and equitable healthcare. To address these challenges, we need to establish diverse and interdisciplinary teams equipped to develop and apply medical AI in a fair, accountable and transparent manner. We formulate the importance of including social science perspectives in the development of intersectionally beneficent and equitable AI for biomedical research and healthcare, in part by strengthening AI health evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Background\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drove investment and research into medical imaging platforms to provide data to create artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the management of patients with COVID-19. Building on the success of Englandâs National COVID-19 Chest Imaging Database, the national digital policy body (NHSX) sought to create a generalized national medical imaging platform for the development, validation, and deployment of algorithms.\nObjective\nThis study aims to understand international use cases of medical imaging platforms for the development and implementation of algorithms to inform the creation of Englandâs national imaging platform.\nMethods\nThe National Health Service (NHS) AI Lab Policy and Strategy Team adopted a multiphased approach: (1) identification and prioritization of national AI imaging platforms; (2) Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental (PESTLE) factor analysis deep dive into national AI imaging platforms; (3) semistructured interviews with key stakeholders; (4) workshop on emerging themes and insights with the internal NHSX team; and (5) formulation of policy recommendations.\nResults\nInternational use cases of national AI imaging platforms (n=7) were prioritized for PESTLE factor analysis. Stakeholders (n=13) from the international use cases were interviewed. Themes (n=8) from the semistructured interviews, including interview quotes, were analyzed with workshop participants (n=5). The outputs of the deep dives, interviews, and workshop were synthesized thematically into 8 categories with 17 subcategories. On the basis of the insights from the international use cases, policy recommendations (n=12) were developed to support the NHS AI Lab in the design and development of the English national medical imaging platform.\nConclusions\nThe creation of AI algorithms supporting technology and infrastructure such as platforms often occurs in isolation within countries, let alone between countries. This novel policy research project sought to bridge the gap by learning from the challenges, successes, and experience of Englandâs international counterparts. Policy recommendations based on international learnings focused on the demonstrable benefits of the platform to secure sustainable funding, validation of algorithms and infrastructure to support in situ deployment, and creating wraparound tools for nontechnical participants such as clinicians to engage with algorithm creation. As health care organizations increasingly adopt technological solutions, policy makers have a responsibility to ensure that initiatives are informed by learnings from both national and international initiatives as well as disseminating the outcomes of their work.",

Concerns have been raised about closed-box AI modelsâ transparency and their suitability for use in digital evidence mining. While AI models are firmly rooted in mathematical, statistical, and computational theories, the argument has centered on their explainability and understandability, particularly in terms of how they arrive at certain conclusions. This paper examines the issues with closed-box models; the goals; and methods of explainability/interpretability. Most importantly, recommendations for interpretable AI-based digital forensics (DF) investigation are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The China State Council released the new generation artificial intelligence (AI) development plan, outlining China's ambitious aspiration to assume global leadership in AI by the year 2030. This initiative underscores the extensive applicability of AI across diverse domains, including manufacturing, law, and medicine. With China establishing itself as a major producer and consumer of medical devices, there has been a notable increase in software registrations. This study aims to study the proliferation of health careârelated software development within China. This work presents an overview of the Chinese regulatory framework for medical device software. The analysis covers both software as a medical device and software in a medical device. A comparative approach is employed to examine the regulations governing medical devices with AI and machine learning in China, the United States, and Europe. The study highlights the significant proliferation of health careârelated software development within China, which has led to an increased demand for comprehensive regulatory guidance, particularly for international manufacturers. The comparative analysis reveals distinct regulatory frameworks and requirements across the three regions. This paper provides a useful outline of the current state of regulations for medical software in China and identifies the regulatory challenges posed by the rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies. Understanding these challenges is crucial for international manufacturers and stakeholders aiming to navigate the complex regulatory landscape.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nAutomated social presence (ASP) and consumer robot experience are analyzed together.\nâ¢\nASP makes consumers feel understood, empowered and connected.\nâ¢\nNeed for social interaction reinforces the impact of ASP on social experience.\nâ¢\nA positive consumer robot experience enhances its functional and social value.\nâ¢\nValue perceptions positively influence the intention to use service robots.\nAbstract\nConsumers are increasingly embracing robots and AI. This has led them to suffer psychological tensions in their AI experiences (e.g., data capture, classification, delegation and social experiences). This exploratory research proposes that AI with higher perceived automated presence (sense of being with another being) alleviates psychological tensions. This in turn leads to consumer perceptions of higher functional and social value and higher future use intention. A study into service robots (n = 331) supported the proposal that consumersâ perceptions of greater automated social presence in service robots makes them feel understood rather than misunderstood, empowered rather than replaced and connected rather than alienated, which increases their functional and social value perceptions and intention to use robots in the future. The impact of automated social presence on social experience is higher for consumers with a higher need for social interaction. This research lends weight to some theoretical proposals made in previous literature that were, at that point, empirically unexplored.",

Using text inputs, the AI tool generated fictitious images based on neural network analyses. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the direction of general medicine in Japan has long been unclear, despite constant discussion. Our AI analysis shows that Japanese medicine is currently plagued by issues with polypharmacy, likely because of the aging patient population. Additionally, the analysis indicated a distressed female physician and evoked a sense of anxiety about the future of female physicians. It discusses whether the ability to encourage the success of female physicians is a turning point for the future of medicine in Japan.",

AI builds dynamic consumer-brand relationships that help build sustainable businesses for brands to thrive. The brands sustain in competitive markets by crafting engaging brand narratives that holistically influence consumer purchase decisions. The present study comprehensively reviews the theoretical underpinnings of AI-driven branding from the extant literature. The thematic analysis of theoretical premises instrumentalises developing a novel integrated theoretical framework. The intricate analysis of the constellation of theories and the simultaneous amalgamation of concepts allows for a unified viewpoint. The integrated theoretical framework offers an in-depth overview of the drivers, mediators, moderators, and consequences of AI-driven branding. The integrated theoretical framework extends the current theoretical understanding of consumer-brand relational dynamics with AI that practitioners may use to sustainably transform their brands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) brings great potential but also risks to the electricity industry. Following the EU's current regulatory proposal, the EU Regulation for Artificial Intelligence (AI Act), there will be direct, potentially adverse effects on companies of the electricity industry in Europe and beyond, as well as those active in the development of AI systems. In this paper, we develop a replicable framework for estimating compliance costs for different electricity market agents that will need to comply with the numerous requirements the AI Act imposes. The electricity systems of Austria, Greece and Switzerland are used as case-studies. We estimate annual, aggregated costs for electricity market agents ranging from less than one million to almost 200 million Euros per country, depending on compliance costs scenarios. Results suggest that a profit growth of 10% through AI utilization is needed to offset the highest added compliance cost of the AI Act on electricity market agents. Eventually, we further show how to assess the regional differences of these costs added to system operation, providing spatially disaggregated compliance costs estimates that consider the structural differences of the electricity industry within 26 Swiss cantons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCombining artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques in the quest for environmental sustainability has emerged as a promising strategy. This paper explores the potential of a Federated Long Short-Term Memory (Fed LSTM) model in addressing environmental challenges through decentralized learning and efficient intelligence. Fed LSTM, a model tailored for government curricula, offers a novel method for analyzing and optimizing disaggregated environmental data across multiple sites while preserving data privacy. Its applications in environmental sustainability span various domains. Firstly, energy policy enables the creation of accurate local energy consumption forecasting models by integrating data from diverse sources such as buildings, infrastructure, and renewable energy installations. Secondly, in environmental monitoring, Fed LSTM facilitates the quantification of key parameters like biodiversity levels. Thirdly, resource efficiency optimizes the use of resources in agriculture, water management, and waste management, leading to more efficient resource management and reduced environmental impact. The benefits of Fed LSTM have the potential to significantly enhance environmental sustainability by providing adaptive solutions and new options for managing complex environmental challenges through decentralized and privacy-protected approaches. This paper advocates for further research and effective implementation of Fed LSTM in environmental sustainability initiatives to realize its full potential in promoting positive environmental development. With an accuracy of 99.2â¯%, surpassing existing methods, this approach is implemented using Python.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGerman companies are currently facing challenges like the Demographic Change. Due to the retirement of many long-standing employees, companies risk losing tacit experimental know-how. This specific type of knowledge is difficult to capture and transfer to unexperienced workers. The objective of the research project âKI_eeper - Know how to keepâ is to solve this challenge by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the development of a self-learning assistance system. Knowledge transfer as well as AI can cause fears among workforces, which hampers user acceptance of new AI-based tools. Therefore, the employees got proactively involved from an early development stage on through different measures, like e. g. workshops and process analyses. In particular the ELSI+UX workshop openly embraces potential challenges of AI implementation and the fears of employees. Furthermore, the employees get the chance to provide direct feedback about the technical solution of how user-friendly it is for their work process. This contribution focuses on the conception and realization of an ELSI+UX workshop. In the workshop the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) as well as user experience (UX) of the technical conception were assessed by the employees. This approach promoted substantial progress of the project and nurtured user acceptance of the AI system.",

There has been a significant increase in the number of new small satellites that are launched, which is complemented by the rapid pace of the development of image recognition algorithms. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in computer vision related applications. Combining both and running an AI algorithm on-board the satellite to observe and recognize any natural disaster directly from the orbit is an important opportunity. This paper presents notable challenges that are generally involved in an Earth Observation small satellite mission and further challenges that are posed by combining it with AI-based image recognition on-board the satellite. This study discusses an approach that is feasible mainly for a fleet of small satellites.",

EVs can serve as distributed energy resources, aiding in peak shaving, frequency management, and voltage support, thus enhancing grid stability. This comprehensive review explores the transformative potential of EVs in the power grid, focusing on Vehicle-to-Grid (V2 G) technology. We discuss different bidirectional Converter types, including AC-DC and DC-DC converters, to optimize power flow and voltage regulation. AC-DC converters rectify AC grid power for DC charging, while DC-DC converters optimize DC power flow and voltage regulation. Charging station safety is paramount, with electrical shock protection, fire protection, and cybersecurity measures essential for ensuring safe and reliable charging. The review also delves into energy trading and security in blockchain management, highlighting the use of blockchain technology to address hacking vulnerabilities. We explore the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to optimize V2 G performance. By leveraging AI and ML, we can improve the efficiency, reliability, and scalability of V2 G systems. AI-powered predictive analytics can forecast energy demand and supply, enabling proactive charging and discharging strategies. ML algorithms can optimize charging rates, battery health, and grid stability while also detecting anomalies and preventing potential faults. By integrating AI and ML into V2 G systems, we can unlock new possibilities for sustainable energy management, grid resilience, and electric vehicle adoption.",

Changes in bottle orientation were detected using an accelerometer attached to the container, and acceleration waveforms and date/time data were recorded. Patients visited the clinic during the 4th and 8th weeks to report their eye drop administration, and the data were uploaded to the cloud.\nMain outcome measures: Two AI models (B-LSTM) were created to analyze the eye drop bottle movement time-series data for patients treating one or both eyes. The models were evaluated by comparing the true administration status with the AI model judgment.\nResults\nFour of the 61 study subjects dropped out. The remaining 57 patients achieved recall, precision, and accuracy values of 98.6 %, 98.6 %, and 95.9 %, respectively, for the two-eyes model and 95.8 %, 98.8 %, and 95.6 % for the one-eye model. Three low-accuracy participants (77.1 %, 71.0 %, and 81.0 %) improved to 100 %, 99.1 %, and 100 %, respectively, after undergoing an additional 8-week performance validation using an aid-type container designed to ensure that the bottle was fully inverted during instillation.\nConclusions\nCASEA precisely monitored daily eye drop adherence and enhanced treatment efficacy by identifying patients with difficulty self-medicating. This system has the potential to improve glaucoma patient outcomes by supporting adherence.",

The three organisations expect AI to contribute to sustainability and a prosperous future with better data analysis, greater amounts of quantitative knowledge, and by making economic and social activities less wasteful and more energy efficient. Several challenges are also named: ethics, human rights, cybersecurity, access to reliable data, transparency, and the digital gap. The solutions presented are multi-stakeholder collaboration, cohesive but flexible governance frameworks, but also taking the lead to push for ethical and value-based AI and making sure AI is sustainable. Ideas about AI appear to stem from discourses of ecological modernisation and green governmentality. This framing turns political and structural challenges into technical issues to be solved with more data, greater collaboration, and technical progress. The similarities in ideas between the EU, the UN, and the World Economic Forum also suggest that ideas about AI and sustainable development have reached discourse institutionalisation. Ideas about AI are therefore likely to reinforce already existing institutional and discursive settings.",

ChatGPT has demonstrated the capability of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)-powered chatbots when deployed to answer crisis-related questions in a timely and cost-efficient manner, thus replacing humans in crisis communication. However, public reactions to such messages remain unknown. To address this problem, this study recruited participants (N1 = 399, N2 = 189, and N3 = 121) and conducted two online vignette experiments and a qualitative survey. The results suggest that, when organizations fail to handle crisis-related requests, stakeholders exhibit higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution to chatbots providing instructing (vs. adjusting) information, as they are perceived to be more competent. However, when organizations satisfy requests, chatbots that provide adjusting (vs. instructing information) lead to higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution due to higher perceived competence. The second experiment involving a public emergency crisis scenario reveals that, regardless of the information provided (instructing or adjusting), stakeholders exhibit greater satisfaction and positive attitudes toward high-competence (vs. low-competence) chatbots. The qualitative study further confirms the experimental findings and offers insights to improve crisis chatbots. These findings contribute to the literature by extending situational crisis communication theory to nonhuman touchpoints and providing a deeper understanding of using chatbots in crisis communication through the lens of machine heuristics. The study also offers practical guidance for organizations to strategically integrate chatbots and human agents in crisis management based on context.",

This is primarily attributable to the limited availability of resources and technical expertise. However, a major obstacle is that AI needs to be flexible enough to work in many different applications, utilising a wide variety of datasets through cloud computing. As a result, we developed a benchmark toolkit called CloudAISim to make use of the power of AI and cloud computing in order to satisfy the requirements of modern applications. The goal of this study is to come up with a strategy for building a bridge so that AI can be utilised in order to assist those who are not very knowledgeable about technological advancements. In addition, we modelled a healthcare application as a case study in order to verify the scientific reliability of the CloudAISim toolkit and simulated it in a cloud computing environment using Google Cloud Functions to increase its real-time efficiency. A non-expert-friendly interface built with an interactive web app has also been developed. Any user without any technical knowledge can operate the entire model, which has a 98% accuracy rate. The proposed use case is designed to put AI to work in the healthcare industry, but CloudAISim would be useful and adaptable for other applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nHigher education is crucial for producing ethical citizens and professionals globally. The introduction of generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has posed opportunities and challenges to the traditional model of education. However, the current conversations primarily focus on policy development and assessment, with limited research on the future of higher education. GenAI's impact on learning outcomes, pedagogy, and assessment is crucial for reforming and advancing the workforce. This qualitative study aims to investigate student perspectives on GenAI's impact on higher education. The study uses an initial conceptual framework driven by a systematic literature review to investigate the opportunities and challenges of AI in education. This framework serves as an initial data collection and analysis framework. A sample of 51 students from three research-intensive universities was selected for this study. Thematic analysis identified three themes and 10 subthemes. The findings suggest that future higher education should be transformed to train students to be future-ready for employment in a society powered by GenAI. They suggest new learning outcomesâskills in learning and teaching with GenAI, AI literacyâand emphasize the significance of interdisciplinarity and maker learning, with assessment focusing on in-class and hands-on activities. They recommend six future research directions â competence for future workforce and its self-assessment measures, AI literacy or competency measures, new literacies and their relationships, interdisciplinary teaching, Innovative pedagogies and their evaluation, new assessment and its acceptance.",

Variation in housing price appreciation across neighborhoods reflects localized housing demand and supply-side factors. This study develops quality-adjusted, census tract-level housing price indices using a fine-grained big dataset containing a total of 140,289 housing transactions in the County of Los Angeles. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique, an explainable artificial intelligence framework, to examine the underlying demographic and socioeconomic factors that help in explaining the variance in tract-level housing price appreciation from 2012 through 2018 in the County of Los Angeles. The novelty of the methodology lies in the local interpretation of spatial patterns it provides from big data in the urban context and in assessing how the factors influencing housing price appreciation vary geographically. The modeling framework could help planners in making informed decisions about local geographic contexts that contribute to variability in housing price appreciation in cities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven tool designed to convert deflection test results into crucial soil parameters essential for quality assurance in compaction projects. The accurate determination of these parameters, such as density and void ratio, is imperative for ensuring the structural integrity of infrastructures constructed on such soils. Moreover, it facilitates the utilization of modern non-destructive equipment in compaction endeavors. The determination of these parameters is notably challenging in unsaturated soils owing to the intricate interplay among factors such as suction, moisture content, void ratio, and resulting deflection.\nThis paper presents a pioneering tool to address these challenges. By integrating unsaturated soil mechanics with advanced AI techniques, particularly reinforcement learning, the tool leverages a diverse array of inputs, including in-situ data, experimental observations, and physics-based modeling. This integration enables dynamic adaptation to changing field conditions and ensuring the toolâs real-time adaptability and predictive accuracy.\nField trials validated the toolâs efficacy in predicting soil properties accurately without direct measurements of moisture content or suction, variables often unmeasured in practical soil compaction projects. This unique capability underscores significant advancements in real-time assessment of unsaturated soils, illustrating the transformative potential of AI in geotechnical engineering and unsaturated soil mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can provide opportunities for enriching educational experiences, but at the same time raise concerns regarding academic integrity. Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.",

    "abstract": "Subcellular metabolomics analysis is crucial for understanding intracellular heterogeneity and accurate drugâcell interactions. Unfortunately, the ultra-small size and complex microenvironment inside the cell pose a great challenge to achieving this goal. To address this challenge, we propose an artificial intelligence-assisted subcellular mass spectrometry imaging (AI-SMSI) strategy with in situ image segmentation. Based on the nanometer-resolution MSI technique, the protonated guanine and threonine ions were respectively employed as the nucleus and cytoplasmic markers to complete image segmentation at the subcellular level, avoiding mutual interference of signals from various compartments in the cell. With advanced AI models, the metabolites within the different regions could be further integrated and profiled. Through this method, we decrypted the distinct action mechanism of isomeric drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and epirubicin (EPI), only with a stereochemical inversion at C-4â². Within the cytoplasmic region, fifteen specific metabolites were discovered as biomarkers for distinguishing the drug action difference between DOX and EPI. Moreover, we identified that the downregulations of glutamate and aspartate in the malateâaspartate shuttle pathway may contribute to the higher paratoxicity of DOX. Our current AI-SMSI approach has promising applications for subcellular metabolomics analysis and thus opens new opportunities to further explore drugâcell specific interactions for the long-term pursuit of precision medicine.\nA unique artificial intelligence-assisted subcellular mass spectrometry imaging strategy to decrypt the distinct action mechanism of isomeric drugs.\nDownload: Download high-res image (819KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This limitation impedes rapid varietal turnover, crucial for maintaining high yields and food security under climate change. Low adoption of improved varieties results from a top-down system in which farmers have been more passive recipients than active participants in varietal development.\nOBJECTIVE\nA new suite of research at the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT seeks to democratize crop breeding by leveraging mobile phenotyping technologies for high-quality, decentralized data collection. This approach aims to resolve the inherent limitations and inconsistencies in traditional visual phenotyping methods, allowing for more accurate and efficient crop assessment. In parallel, the research seeks to harness multimodal data on farmer preferences to better tailor variety development to meet specific production and consumption goals.\nMETHODS\nNovel mobile phenotyping tools were developed and field-tested on breeder stations in Colombia and Tanzania, and data from these trials were analyzed for quality and accuracy, and compared with traditional manual estimates and absolute ground truth data. Concurrently, Human-Centered Design (HCD) methods were applied to ensure the technology suits its context of use, and serves the nuanced requirements of breeders.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nComputer vison (CV)-enabled mobile phenotyping achieved a significant reduction in scoring variation, attaining imagery-modeled trait accuracies with Pearson Correlation values between 0.88 and 0.95 with ground truth data, and reduced labor requirements with the ability to fully phenotype a breeder's plot (4 m Ã 3 m) in under a minute. With this technology, high-quality quantitative phenotyping data can be collected by anyone with a smartphone, expanding the potential to measure crop performance in decentralized on-farm environments and improving accuracy and speed of crop improvement on breeder stations.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nInclusive innovations in mobile phenotyping technologies and AI-supported data collection enable rapid, accurate trait assessment and actively involve farmers in variety selection, aligning breeding programs with local needs and preferences. These advancements offer a timely solution for accelerating varietal turnover to mitigate climate change impacts, while ensuring developed varieties are both high-performing and culturally relevant.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (145KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

To date, there have been limited studies published regarding how best to validate newer AI-based digital systems for screening Pap tests in clinical practice. In this study, we validated the Geniusâ¢ Digital Diagnostics System (Hologic) by comparing the performance to traditional manual light microscopic diagnosis of ThinPrepÂ® Pap test slides. A total of 319 ThinPrepÂ® Pap test cases were prospectively assessed by six cytologists and three cytopathologists by light microscopy and digital evaluation and the results compared to the original ground truth Pap test diagnosis. Concordance with the original diagnosis was significantly different by digital and manual light microscopy review when comparing across: (i) exact Bethesda System diagnostic categories (62.1% vs 55.8%, respectively, pâ¯=â¯0.014), (ii) condensed diagnostic categories (76.8% vs 71.5%, respectively, pâ¯=â¯0.027), and (iii) condensed diagnoses based on clinical management (71.5% vs 65.2%, respectively, pâ¯=â¯0.017). Time to evaluate cases was shorter for digital (Mâ¯=â¯3.2â¯min, SDâ¯=â¯2.2) compared to manual (Mâ¯=â¯5.9â¯min, SDâ¯=â¯3.1) review (t(352)â¯=â¯19.44, pâ¯<â¯0.001, Cohen's dâ¯=â¯1.035, 95% CI [0.905, 1.164]). Not only did our validation study demonstrate that AI-based digital Pap test evaluation had improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced screening time compared to light microscopy, but that participants reported a positive experience using this system.",

Currently, analysis of cellular structure and tumor morphology through microscopic images remains one of the main diagnostic methods for osteosarcoma. However, this completely manual approach is tedious, time-consuming, and difficult to diagnose accurately due to the similarities in certain characteristics of malignant and benign tumors.\nMethods\nLeveraging the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in assessing and classifying images, this study explored a modified CA-MobileNet V3 model that was embedded into innovative microscope products to enhance the microscopeâs feature extraction capabilities and help reduce misclassification during diagnosis.\nResults\nThe intelligent recognition model method introduced in this paper has significant advantages in retrieval and classification of osteosarcoma cells and other cell types. Compared with models such as ShuffleNet V2, EfficientNet V2, Mobilenet V3 (without transfer learning), TL-MobileNet V3 (with transfer learning), etc., the model size is only 5.33 MB, is a lightweight model, and the accuracy of the improved model reached 98.69 %. In addition, the artificial intelligence microscope (AIM) with integrated design based on this model can also help improve diagnostic efficiency.\nConclusion\nThe innovative method of the CA-MobileNet V3 automatic classification model based on deep learning provides an efficient and reliable solution for the pathological diagnosis of osteosarcoma. This study contributes to medical image analysis and provides doctors with an accurate and valuable tool for microscopic diagnosis. It also promotes the advancement of artificial intelligence in medical imaging technology.",

Despite advantages in expertise and flexibility, HES processes face legitimacy problems and struggle with epistemic gaps in the context of AI. This article addresses the problems that characterize HES processes by outlining the conceptual need, theoretical basis, and practical application of experimental standardization, which is defined as an ex-ante evaluation method that can be used to test standards for their effects and effectiveness. Experimental standardization is based on theoretical and practical developments in experimental governance, legislation, and innovation. Aligned with ideas and frameworks like Science for Policy and evidence-based policymaking, it enables co-creation between science and policymaking. We apply the proposed concept in the context of HES processes, where we submit that experimental standardization contributes to increasing throughput and output legitimacy, addressing epistemic gaps, and generating new regulatory knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to have a substantial impact in the health care space. While a plethora of web-based resources exist to teach programming skills and ML model development, there are few introductory curricula specifically tailored to medical students without a background in data science or programming. Programs that do exist are often restricted to a specific specialty.\nObjective\nWe hypothesized that a 1-month elective for fourth-year medical students, composed of high-quality existing web-based resources and a project-based structure, would empower students to learn about the impact of AI and ML in their chosen specialty and begin contributing to innovation in their field of interest. This study aims to evaluate the success of this elective in improving self-reported confidence scores in AI and ML. The authors also share our curriculum with other educators who may be interested in its adoption.\nMethods\nThis elective was offered in 2 tracks: technical (for students who were already competent programmers) and nontechnical (with no technical prerequisites, focusing on building a conceptual understanding of AI and ML). Students established a conceptual foundation of knowledge using curated web-based resources and relevant research papers, and were then tasked with completing 3 projects in their chosen specialty: a data set analysis, a literature review, and an AI project proposal. The project-based nature of the elective was designed to be self-guided and flexible to each studentâs interest area and career goals. Studentsâ success was measured by self-reported confidence in AI and ML skills in pre and postsurveys. Qualitative feedback on studentsâ experiences was also collected.\nResults\nThis web-based, self-directed elective was offered on a pass-or-fail basis each month to fourth-year students at Emory University School of Medicine beginning in May 2021. As of June 2022, a total of 19 students had successfully completed the elective, representing a wide range of chosen specialties: diagnostic radiology (n=3), general surgery (n=1), internal medicine (n=5), neurology (n=2), obstetrics and gynecology (n=1), ophthalmology (n=1), orthopedic surgery (n=1), otolaryngology (n=2), pathology (n=2), and pediatrics (n=1). Studentsâ self-reported confidence scores for AI and ML rose by 66% after this 1-month elective. In qualitative surveys, students overwhelmingly reported enthusiasm and satisfaction with the course and commented that the self-direction and flexibility and the project-based design of the course were essential.\nConclusions\nCourse participants were successful in diving deep into applications of AI in their widely-ranging specialties, produced substantial project deliverables, and generally reported satisfaction with their elective experience. The authors are hopeful that a brief, 1-month investment in AI and ML education during medical school will empower this next generation of physicians to pave the way for AI and ML innovation in health care.",

This paper therefore examines the potential impact of ChatGPT on learning and assessment, using the example of academic essays, being a major form of assessment with widespread applications of ChatGPT. This provides an opportunity to unpack broader insights on the challenge of generative AI's to the relevance, quality and credibility of higher education learning in a rapidly changing 21st century knowledge economy. We conducted a quasi-experiment in which we deployed ChatGPT to generate academic essays in response to a typical assessment brief, and then subjected the essays to plagiarism checks and independent grading. The results indicate that ChatGPT is able to generate highly original, and high quality, contents from distinct individual accounts in response to the same assessment brief. However, it is unable to generate multiple original contents from the same account, and it struggled with referencing. The discussion highlights the need for higher education providers to rethink their approach to assessment, in response to disruption precipitated by artificial intelligence. Thus, following the discussion of empirical data, we propose a new conceptual framework for AI-assisted assessment for lifelong learning, in which the parameters of assessment extend beyond knowledge (know what) testing, to competence (know how) assessment and performance (show how) evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAncient murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, have profound historical and cultural significance. However, these murals often face degradation phenomena such as peeling, fading, and cracking, which compromises their preservation. Conventional methodologies for protection and restoration exhibit limitations and do not adequately address multifaceted damage conditions, thus necessitating the integration of advanced technological interventions to enhance restoration effectiveness.This paper delineates a framework for the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage buildings that uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using real-time environmental and structural health surveillance, in conjunction with security mechanisms, this framework markedly improves precision and efficiency in forecasting and identifying potential risks.Furthermore, in the context of mural restoration, this paper introduces the ArtDiff model. This model amalgamates a modified U-Net for initial crack detection with an edge-guided restoration technique, employing a diffusion model for meticulous restoration. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of the ArtDiff model in crack detection and mural restoration, delivering a greater precision and efficacy relative to existing approaches. Through the implementation of multilevel supervision strategies and an avant-garde model architecture, this study offers a sophisticated mural restoration solution, furnishing novel technological support for the preservation of cultural heritage.",

The experts prepared 50 questions (including dimensions of, risk factors, preventive measures, diagnostic methods, and treatment options) that would be presented to ChatGPT, and its responses were rated for their accuracy, completeness, relevance, clarity or comprehensibility, and possible risks using a standardized rubric. To carry out the assessment of the responses by ChatGPT, a standardized scoring rubric was used. Evaluation process included feedback concerning the strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement in the responses provided by ChatGPT.\nResults\nWhile achieving the highest score for preventive dentistry at 4.3/5 and being able to communicate the complex information coherently, the tool showed lower accuracy for oral surgery and oral cancer, scoring 3.9/5 and 3.6/5, respectively, with several gaps for post-operative instructions, personalized risk assessments, and specialized diagnostic methods. Potential risks, such as a lack of individualized advice, were shown in 53% of the oral cancer and in 40% of the oral surgery. While showing promise in some domains, ChatGPT had important limitations in specialized areas that require nuanced expertise.\nConclusion\nThe findings point to the need for professional supervision while using AI-generated information and ongoing evaluation as capabilities evolve, for the assurance of responsible implementation in the best interest of patient care.",

Such knowledge and skills have led to the emergence of AI literacy. Despite the importance of AI literacy in everyday life, little is known about its determinants. To better understand the determinants of AI literacy, we attempted to build a research model relying on previous research and different theoretical frameworks. The model incorporated digital divide, cognitive absorption, and computational thinking. As a major finding from the current study, computational thinking was found to be a significant determinant of AI literacy, which facilitate using, recognizing, and evaluating AI-based technologies. Moreover, we found out that individuals with physical access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more expected to use and recognize AI. Also, motivation and skills in using ICTs enable individuals to better evaluate the outcomes of AI-based technologies. The findings also showed that convenient access to ICTs contributes to a deep involvement with AI-based technologies in the use. Further, individuals with higher motivation and skills to use AI technologies are likely to have a pleasant experience after using these technologies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCompetition between companies, especially in the metalworking industry, has driven the continuous search for strategies that aim to reduce costs, improve product quality, and shorten delivery times. However, a persistent challenge that these industries face is delivery delays, caused by a number of complex factors, including supply chain issues, project management difficulties, technical and work issues.\nTo address this issue, several approaches and methodologies have been adopted. On the one hand, agile management tools such as Scrum, Prince2 Agile, Lean Project Management, Agile Project Management and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) have been implemented to increase the flexibility and adaptability of production processes. On the other hand, classic analytical solutions, such as the Gantt/Waterfall Method, PMBOK Guide, Spiral Model, Prince2 and the Critical Path Method (CPM) and/or the PERT method, have been applied to ensure a clearer and more structured view of projects.\nIn addition to these traditional approaches, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in project management. A detailed analysis of articles reveals a marked preference for Machine Learning (ML), with particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These AI techniques have been successfully applied in a variety of projects, especially in civil construction, helping to predict and mitigate delays, improve operational efficiency and optimize resource allocation.\nDespite the progress made, research on the use of AI in project management still faces significant challenges, as reflected in the scarcity of available studies on the topic in project management in the metalworking industry.",

Current techniques fall short in visualizing such confounding factors. We propose DiffChest, a self-conditioned diffusion model trained on 515,704 chest radiographs from 194,956 patients across the US and Europe. DiffChest provides patient-specific explanations and visualizes confounding factors that might mislead the model. The high inter-reader agreement, with Fleissâ kappa values of 0.8 or higher, validates its capability to identify treatment-related confounders. Confounders are accurately detected with 10%â100% prevalence rates. The pretraining process optimizes the model for relevant imaging information, resulting in excellent diagnostic accuracy for 11 chest conditions, including pleural effusion and heart insufficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of diffusion models in medical image classification, providing insights into confounding factors and enhancing model robustness and reliability.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (202KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Background\nAs digital technologies and especially artificial intelligence (AI) become increasingly important in health care, it is essential to determine whether and why potential users intend to use related health information systems (HIS). Several theories exist, but they focus mainly on aspects of health care or information systems, in addition to general psychological theories, and hence provide a small number of variables to explain future behavior. Thus, research that provides a larger number of variables by combining several theories from health care, information systems, and psychology is necessary.\nObjective\nThis study aims to investigate the intention to use new HIS for decisions concerning short- and long-term medical treatments using an integrated approach with several variables to explain future behavior.\nMethods\nWe developed an integrated theoretical model based on theories from health care, information systems, and psychology that allowed us to analyze the duality approach of adaptive and nonadaptive appraisals and their influence on the intention to use HIS. We applied the integrated theoretical model to the short-term treatment using AI-based HIS for surgery and the long-term treatment of diabetes tracking using survey data with structured equation modeling. To differentiate between certain levels of AI involvement, we used several scenarios that include treatments by physicians only, physicians with AI support, and AI only to understand how individuals perceive the influence of AI.\nResults\nOur results showed that for short- and long-term treatments, the variables perceived threats, fear (disease), perceived efficacy, attitude (HIS), and perceived norms are important to consider when determining the intention to use AI-based HIS. Furthermore, the results revealed that perceived efficacy and attitude (HIS) are the most important variables to determine intention to use for all treatments and scenarios. In contrast, abilities (HIS) were important for short-term treatments only. For our 9 scenarios, adaptive and nonadaptive appraisals were both important to determine intention to use, depending on whether the treatment is known. Furthermore, we determined RÂ² values that varied between 57.9% and 81.7% for our scenarios, which showed that the explanation power of our model is medium to good.\nConclusions\nWe contribute to HIS literature by highlighting the importance of integrating disease- and technology-related factors and by providing an integrated theoretical model. As such, we show how adaptive and nonadaptive appraisals should be arranged to report on medical decisions in the future, especially in the short and long terms. Physicians and HIS developers can use our insights to identify promising rationale for HIS adoption concerning short- and long-term treatments and adapt and develop HIS accordingly. Specifically, HIS developers should ensure that future HIS act in terms of HIS functions, as our study shows that efficient HIS lead to a positive attitude toward the HIS and ultimately to a higher intention to use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) applications proliferate, their creators seemingly anticipate that users will make similar trade-offs between costs and benefits across various commercial and public applications, due to the technological similarity of the provided solutions. With a multimethod investigation, this study reveals instead that users develop idiosyncratic evaluations of benefits and costs depending on the context of AI implementation. In particular, the tensions that drive AI adoption depend on perceived personal costs and choice autonomy relative to the perceived (personal vs. societal) benefits. The tension between being served rather than exploited is lowest for public AI directed at infrastructure (cf. commercial AI), due to lower perceived costs. Surveillance AI evaluations are driven by fears beyond mere privacy breaches, which overcome the societal and safety benefits. Privacy-breaching applications are more acceptable when public entities implement them (cf. commercial). The authors provide guidelines for public policy and AI practitioners, based on how consumers trade off solutions that differ in their benefits, costs, data transparency, and privacy enhancements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe human endometrium undergoes a monthly cycle of tissue growth and degeneration. During the mid-secretory phase, the endometrium establishes an optimal niche for embryo implantation by regulating cellular composition (e.g., epithelial and stromal cells) and differentiation. Impaired endometrial development observed in conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and recurrent implantation failure (RIF) contributes to infertility. Surprisingly, despite the importance of the endometrial lining properly developing prior to pregnancy, precise measures of endometrial cellular composition in these two infertility-associated conditions are entirely lacking. Additionally, current methods for measuring the epithelial and stromal area have limitations, including intra- and inter-observer variability and efficiency.\nMethods\nWe utilized a deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) model, created on a cloud-based platform and developed in our previous study. The AI model underwent training to segment both areas populated by epithelial and stromal endometrial cells. During the training step, a total of 28.36 mm2 areas were annotated, comprising 2.56 mm2 of epithelium and 24.87 mm2 of stroma. Two experienced pathologists validated the performance of the AI model. 73 endometrial samples from healthy control women were included in the sample set to establish cycle phase-dependent dynamics of the endometrial epithelial-to-stroma ratio from the proliferative (PE) to secretory (SE) phases. In addition, 91 samples from PCOS cases, accounting for the presence or absence of ovulation and representing all menstrual cycle phases, and 29 samples from RIF patients on day 5 after progesterone administration in the hormone replacement treatment cycle were also included and analyzed in terms of cellular composition.\nResults\nOur AI model exhibited reliable and reproducible performance in delineating epithelial and stromal compartments, achieving an accuracy of 92.40% and 99.23%, respectively. Moreover, the performance of the AI model was comparable to the pathologistsâ assessment, with F1 scores exceeding 82% for the epithelium and >96% for the stroma. Next, we compared the endometrial epithelial-to-stromal ratio during the menstrual cycle in women with PCOS and in relation to endometrial receptivity status in RIF patients. The ovulatory PCOS endometrium exhibited epithelial cell proportions similar to those of control and healthy womenâs samples in every cycle phase, from the PE to the late SE, correlating with progesterone levels (control SE, r2 = 0.64, FDR < 0.001; PCOS SE, r2 = 0.52, FDR < 0.001). The mid-SE endometrium showed the highest epithelial percentage compared to both the early and late SE endometrium in both healthy women and PCOS patients. Anovulatory PCOS cases showed epithelial cellular fractions comparable to those of PCOS cases in the PE (Anovulatory, 14.54%; PCOS PE, 15.56%, p = 1.00). We did not observe significant differences in the epithelial-to-stroma ratio in the hormone-induced endometrium in RIF patients with different receptivity statuses.\nConclusion\nThe AI model rapidly and accurately identifies endometrial histology features by calculating areas occupied by epithelial and stromal cells. The AI model demonstrates changes in epithelial cellular proportions according to the menstrual cycle phase and reveals no changes in epithelial cellular proportions based on PCOS and RIF conditions. In conclusion, the AI model can potentially improve endometrial histology assessment by accelerating the analysis of the cellular composition of the tissue and by ensuring maximal objectivity for research and clinical purposes.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (376KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, many who did not scan cytology slides indicated plans to do so in the near future.\nâ¢\nThe major challenges and areas of improvement for cytology whole slide images (WSI) were in the areas of poor image quality compared with surgical WSI where cost was the most cited challenge.\nâ¢\nAreas of cytology practice participants would most like to see artificial intelligence development included screening cytology slides, biomarker quantification, and for quality assurance/quality control.\nIntroduction\nThe integration of whole slide imaging (WSI) and artificial intelligence (AI) with digital cytology has been growing gradually. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the current state of digital cytology. This study aimed to determine the current landscape of digital cytology via a survey conducted as part of the American Society of Cytopathology (ASC) Digital Cytology White Paper Task Force.\nMaterials and methods\nA survey with 43 questions pertaining to the current practices and experiences of WSI and AI in both surgical pathology and cytology was created. The survey was sent to members of the ASC, the International Academy of Cytology (IAC), and the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology (PSC). Responses were recorded and analyzed.\nResults\nIn total, 327 individuals participated in the survey, spanning a diverse array of practice settings, roles, and experiences around the globe. The majority of responses indicated there was routine scanning of surgical pathology slides (n = 134; 61%) with fewer respondents scanning cytology slides (n = 150; 46%). The primary challenge for surgical WSI is the need for faster scanning and cost minimization, whereas image quality is the top issue for cytology WSI. AI tools are not widely utilized, with only 16% of participants using AI for surgical pathology samples and 13% for cytology practice.\nConclusions\nUtilization of digital pathology is limited in cytology laboratories as compared to surgical pathology. However, as more laboratories are willing to implement digital cytology in the near future, the establishment of practical clinical guidelines is needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the construction industry, managing health and safety concerns is paramount to preventing accidents, injuries, and project delays. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into existing health and safety management systems holds the potential for significantly improving risk detection, mitigation, and overall management [1], [2], [3]. However, despite the evident benefits of AI in this domain, there remains a notable gap in the literature concerning the essential factors for successful implementation [4], [5]. This study aims to address this gap by meticulously analyzing the key elements that contribute to the success of AI integration into the digital transformation of health and safety management systems within cutting-edge construction projects. Our methodology involved the identification of 25 factors, drawn from prior research and industry consensus. These factors were subjected to rigorous analysis, including Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) following a pilot survey with field experts and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using data obtained from a comprehensive questionnaire distributed among a representative sample of construction industry experts. The study's findings underscore the paramount importance of six critical constructs in determining the success of AI implementation in construction health and safety management systems: Adaptability, Operation, Management, Reliability, Integration, and Knowledge. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing safety measures in the construction industry through AI-driven solutions.",

The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly âout-of-the-boxâ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nStructural engineers play a critical role in providing safe, durable, and sustainable infrastructure to connect our communities and drive our economy. The recent explosion in opportunities to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into the daily activities of structural engineers offers potential to reduce the workload on the human engineer, giving them more time to focus on creative tasks that require technical expertise and experience. Leveraging AI to support the human engineer has been the focus of several of recent innovative studies conducted by the Intelligent Infrastructure Systems Lab (IISL) at Purdue University. This work has addressed several fundamental challenges related to inefficiencies in the collection, interpretation, analysis, and automated use of large volumes of data, breaking several past barriers to the use of AI methods toward the practice of civil engineering. This paper explores how these innovations are enabling human engineers to harness AI to automate tasks related to extracting information and content from images, providing context to images, and fusing data to support decision- or policy-making. The implications of this integration extend beyond operational efficiencies, offering a pathway to smarter and more resilient infrastructure systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education is a recent development, with chatbots emerging as a noteworthy addition to this transformative landscape. As online learning platforms rapidly advance, students need to adapt swiftly to excel in this dynamic environment. Consequently, understanding the acceptance of chatbots, particularly those employing Large Language Models (LLM) such as Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), Google Bard, and other interactive AI technologies, is of paramount importance. Investigating how students accept and view chatbots is essential to directing their incorporation into Industry 4.0 and enabling a smooth transition to Industry 5.0's customized and human-centered methodology. However, existing research on chatbots in education has overlooked key behavior-related aspects, such as Optimism, Innovativeness, Discomfort, Insecurity, Transparency, Ethics, Interaction, Engagement, and Accuracy, creating a significant literature gap. To address this gap, this study employs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the determinant of chatbots adoption in education among students, considering the Technology Readiness Index and Technology Acceptance Model. Utilizing a five-point Likert scale for data collection, we gathered a total of 185 responses, which were analyzed using R-Studio software. We established 12 hypotheses to achieve its objectives. The results showed that Optimism and Innovativeness are positively associated with Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness. Conversely, Discomfort and Insecurity negatively impact Perceived Ease of Use, with only Insecurity negatively affecting Perceived Usefulness. Furthermore, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Interaction and Engagement, Accuracy, and Responsiveness all significantly contribute to the Intention to Use, whereas Transparency and Ethics have a negative impact on Intention to Use. Finally, Intention to Use mediates the relationships between Interaction, Engagement, Accuracy, Responsiveness, Transparency, Ethics, and Perception of Decision Making. These findings provide insights for future technology designers, elucidating critical user behavior factors influencing chatbots adoption and utilization in educational contexts.",

It compares patient management approaches based on CT severity levels and identifies distinct CT phenotypes linked to disease severity.\nMethodology\nWe retrospectively examined 50 patients diagnosed with bone cancer between December 2022 and June 2023. The CT scans were analyzed according to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) guidelines. This study was performed using the deep convolutional neutral network (DCNN) model to assist doctors in diagnosing bone tumors through CT scanning. Patientsâ management approaches were compared based on the severity levels indicated by CT scans.\nResults\nFifty patients participated in this study, with a median age of 67.2 years, ranging from 32 to 89 years. Of them, 38 % were female and 62 % were male. In 2022, 19 individuals (13 males and 6 females, ages 32 to 84) were assessed, with a mean age of 59.9 years. In 2023, 31 individuals, aged 54 to 89 with a mean age of 71.6 years, were assessed; among them were 18 men and 13 women. SPECT scans revealed the following key diagnostic features: 85.9 % of patients exhibited bone lesions with ground-glass opacities, 88 % had multipolar involvement, 92.8 % had bilateral involvement, and 92.8 % showed peripheral involvement. The severity scores based on CT scans were significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care, with scores above 14 being more common in this group.\nConclusion\nDistinct CT findings during the AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of bone cancer provided prompt and sensitive examination capabilities. Notably, two CT phenotypes emerged, associated with large consolidation patterns and high severity scores, offering crucial insights into disease severity and aiding in clinical decision-making for intensive care requirements. The study underscores the importance of CT in the effective monitoring and management of bone cancer pre- and post-treatment.",

However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the systemâs life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.",

AI systems are held responsible when they act or merely advise a human agent. Does this mean that as soon as AI is involved responsibility follows? To find out, we examined whether purely instrumental AI systems stay clear of responsibility. We compared AI-powered with non-AI-powered car warning systems and measured their responsibility rating alongside their human users. Our findings show that responsibility is shared when the warning system is powered by AI but not by a purely mechanical system, even though people consider both systems as mere tools. Surprisingly, whether the warning prevents the accident introduces an outcome bias: the AI takes higher credit than blame depending on what the human manages or fails to do.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (457KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

By leveraging deep learning techniques and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, a nuanced understanding of energy market dynamics over a comprehensive five-year period is provided by the research. The findings reveal the substantial predictive advantage of the AI model over traditional forecasting methods, with fold-averaged Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of about 0.7 achieved for the two distinct macro-zones N and S. Economically, the model indicates potential for significant market participant gains, with mean efficiencies reaching 16% and 11% for macro-zones N and S, respectively. The implications extend beyond the Italian market, suggesting transformative potentials for European energy markets at large. This work not only fills a critical gap in the literature but also sets a new benchmark for predictive accuracy and economic viability in energy market forecasting.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (227KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed in brine mining to enhance the extraction of lithium, vital for the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, through improved recovery efficiencies and the reduction of energy consumption. An innovative approach was proposed combining Emotional Neural Networks (ENN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to elucidate the adsorption energy (AE) (kcal molâ1) of Li+ ions by utilizing crown ether (CE)-incorporated honeycomb 2D nanomaterials. The screening and feature engineering analysis of honeycomb-patterned 2D materials and individual CE were conducted through Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Gaussian 16 simulations. The selected honeycomb-patterned 2D materials encompass graphene, silicene, and hexagonal boron nitride, while the specific CEs evaluated are 15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6. The crown-passivated 2D surfaces held a significant adsorption site through van der Waals forces for efficient recovery of Li+ ions. ENN predicted the targeted adsorption sites with high precision and minimal deviation. The eTAI (XAI) based Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was also explored for insight into the feature importance of CE embedded 2D nanomaterials for the recovery of Li+ ions. The extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) model demonstrated a RT-2-MAPE = 0.4618% and ENN-2-MAPE = 0.4839% for the feature engineering analysis. This research would be an insight into the AI-driven nanotechnology that presents a viable and sustainable approach for the extraction of natural resources through the application of brine mining.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being employed in brine mining to enhance the extraction of lithium, vital for the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, through improved recovery efficiencies and the reduction of energy consumption.\nDownload: Download high-res image (527KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and its application in the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent technologies are being introduced in the medical field, giving rise to smart healthcare systems. The medical imaging data contains sensitive information, which can easily be stolen or tampered with, necessitating secure encryption schemes designed specifically to protect these images. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence-driven novel encryption scheme tailored for the secure transmission and storage of high-resolution medical images. The proposed scheme utilizes an artificial intelligence-based autoencoder to compress high-resolution medical images and to facilitate fast encryption and decryption. The proposed autoencoder retains important diagnostic information even after reducing the image dimensions. The low-resolution images then undergo a four-stage encryption process. The first two encryption stages involve permutation and the next two stages involve confusion. The first two stages ensure the disruption of the structure of the image, making it secure against statistical attacks. Whereas the two stages of confusion ensure the effective concealment of the pixel values making it difficult to decrypt without secret keys. This encrypted image is then safe for storage or transmission. The proposed scheme has been extensively evaluated against various attacks and statistical security parameters confirming its effectiveness in securing medical image data.",

This has necessitated ongoing updates to accommodate evolving neuromonitoring research needs, including recent explosion of artificial intelligence (AI).\nResearch question\nWe sought to provide an update on the current features of the software. In particular, we aimed to highlight the new options of integrating AI models.\nMaterial and methods\nWe reviewed all currently available ICM+ analytical areas and discussed potential AI based extensions in each. We tested a proof-of-concept integration of an AI model and evaluated its performance for real-time data processing.\nResults\nICM+ current analytical tools serve both real-time (bed-side) and offline (file based) analysis, including the calculation engine, Signal Calculator, Custom Statistics, Batch tools, ScriptLab and charting. The ICM+ Python plugin engine allows to execute custom Python scripts and take advantage of complex AI frameworks. For the proof-of-concept, we used a neural network convolutional model with 207,000 trainable parameters that classifies morphology of intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse waveform into 5 pulse categories (normal to pathological plus artefactual). When evaluated within ICM+ plugin script on a Windows 10 laptop the classification of a 5 min ICP waveform segment took only 0.19s with a 2.3s of initial, one-off, model loading time required.\nConclusions\nModernised ICM+ analytical tools, reviewed in this manuscript, include integration of custom AI models allowing them to be shared and run in real-time, facilitating rapid prototyping and validating of new AI ideas at the bed-side.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nFirst multi-observer study to quantify variation in the scoring of bias and transparency in scientific papers in radiotherapy.\nâ¢\nEven after a full Delphi process and pilot study, low reliability scores were found.\nâ¢\nNew checklists should not use subjective words nor composite questions.\nâ¢\nSingle checklists may not be sufficient as sole scoring method.\nâ¢\nJust like AI models, also checklists should be externally validated.\nAbstract\nBackground and purpose\nStudies investigating the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of radiotherapy exhibit substantial variations in terms of quality. The goal of this study was to assess the amount of transparency and bias in scoring articles with a specific focus on AI based segmentation and treatment planning, using modified PROBAST and TRIPOD checklists, in order to provide recommendations for future guideline developers and reviewers.\nMaterials and methods\nThe TRIPOD and PROBAST checklist items were discussed and modified using a Delphi process. After consensus was reached, 2 groups of 3 co-authors scored 2 articles to evaluate usability and further optimize the adapted checklists. Finally, 10 articles were scored by all co-authors. Fleissâ kappa was calculated to assess the reliability of agreement between observers.\nResults\nThree of the 37 TRIPOD items and 5 of the 32 PROBAST items were deemed irrelevant. General terminology in the items (e.g., multivariable prediction model, predictors) was modified to align with AI-specific terms. After the first scoring round, further improvements of the items were formulated, e.g., by preventing the use of sub-questions or subjective words and adding clarifications on how to score an item. Using the final consensus list to score the 10 articles, only 2 out of the 61 items resulted in a statistically significant kappa of 0.4 or more demonstrating substantial agreement. For 41 items no statistically significant kappa was obtained indicating that the level of agreement among multiple observers is due to chance alone.\nConclusion\nOur study showed low reliability scores with the adapted TRIPOD and PROBAST checklists. Although such checklists have shown great value during development and reporting, this raises concerns about the applicability of such checklists to objectively score scientific articles for AI applications. When developing or revising guidelines, it is essential to consider their applicability to score articles without introducing bias.",

Vendors frequently claim that these technologies are unbiased. However, the impact of these tools on applicants with disabilities is rarely addressed. We explain how these tools may have both positive and negative impacts on applicants with disabilities. In doing so, we consider fundamental principles of selection: the reliability and validity of these tools as well as the applicant experience. We end by offering recommendations to organizations that are considering incorporating AI-based tools into their selection processes.",

Detailed spectrum data about the Earth's surface is provided through hyperspectral imaging, allowing for the monitoring and analyzing several phenomena about agriculture, land use, and environmental sustainability. However, processing, analyzing, and interpreting the massive data produced by hyperspectral sensors is challenging. AI methods and interactive visualization provide practical tools for deriving useful information from hyperspectral data and assisting in decision-making for environmentally friendly applications. This study examines the key elements of an interactive visualization framework powered by AI and emphasizes the advantages and implications for sustainable agricultural operations. This sector's difficulties and potential possibilities are also discussed, focusing on the need for data processing optimization, technology integration, user-friendly interfaces, and ethical issues. In general, interactive hyperspectral image visualization powered by AI shows potential for improving sustainability in agriculture and other related fields.",

In this within-patient controlled trial, preoperative PANO and CBCT images were available, while 3D-AI models of the mandibular canal and teeth were generated from the CBCT images using the Virtual Patient Creator AI platform (Relu BV, Leuven, Belgium). Five examiners, who were blinded to surgical outcomes, assessed the imaging modalities and assigned scores indicating the risk level of IAN injury (high, medium, or low risk). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) for IAN risk assessment were calculated for each imaging modality.\nResults\nFor IAN injury risk assessment after M3M removal, sensitivity was 0.87 for 3D-AI, 0.89 for CBCT versus 0.73 for PANO. Furthermore, the AUC and specificity values were 0.63 and 0.39 for 3D-AI, 0.58 and 0.28 for CBCT, and 0.57 and 0.41 for PANO, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) among the imaging modalities for any diagnostic parameters.\nConclusion\nThis within-patient controlled trial study revealed that risk assessment for IAN injury after M3M removal was rather similar for 3D-AI, PANO, and CBCT, with a sensitivity for injury prediction reaching up to 0.87 for 3D-AI and 0.89 for CBCT.\nClinical significance\nThis within-patient trial is pioneering in exploring the application of 3D AI-driven models for assessing IAN injury risk after M3M removal. The present results indicate that AI-powered 3D models based on CBCT might facilitate IAN risk assessment of M3M removal.",

Artificial intelligence software using deep learning algorithms was applied to determine their likelihood of malignancy: most likely benign (AI score < 50%), undetermined (AI score 50â75%) or probably malignant (AI score > 75%). Predictions were compared to two-year follow-up and Brock's model.\nResults\nNinety incidental pulmonary nodules in 83 patients were retrospectively included. 36 nodules were benign, 13 were malignant and 41 remained indeterminate at 2 years follow-up.\nAI analysis was possible for 81/90 nodules. The 34 benign nodules had an AI score between 0.02% and 96.73% (mean = 48.05 Â± 37.32), while the 11 malignant nodules had an AI score between 82.89% and 100% (mean = 93.9 Â± 2.3). The diagnostic performance of the AI software for positive diagnosis of malignant nodules using a 75% malignancy threshold was: sensitivity = 100% [95% CI 72%-100%]; specificity = 55.8% [38â73]; PPV = 42.3% [23â63]; NPV = 100% [82â100]. With its apparent high NPV, the addition of an AI score to the initial CT could have avoided a guidelines-recommended follow-up in 50% of the benign pulmonary nodules (6/12 nodules).\nConclusion\nArtificial intelligence software using deep learning algorithms presents a strong NPV (100%, with a 95% CI 82â100), suggesting potential use for reducing the need for follow-up of nodules categorized as benign.",

Although using AI in an assistive setting offsets many concerns with autonomous AI in medicine, systems that present all predictions equivalently fail to protect against key AI safety concerns. We design a decision pipeline that supports the diagnostic model with an ecosystem of models, integrating disagreement prediction, clinical significance categorization, and prediction quality modeling to guide prediction presentation. We characterize disagreement using data from a deployed chest X-ray interpretation aid and compare clinician burden in this proposed pipeline to the diagnostic model in isolation. The average disagreement rate is 6.5%, and the expected burden reduction is 4.8%, even if 5% of disagreements on urgent findings receive a second read. We conclude that, in our production setting, we can adequately balance risk mitigation with clinician burden if disagreement false positives are reduced.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (140KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates Data Aggregation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain technologies to enhance the efficiency of healthcare claim adjudication. We present in this study an initial framework that integrates an AI-enhanced smart contract at the data aggregation level. A new concept that enhances the existing smart contract models commonly discussed in blockchain-related insurance literature. Our primary goal is to improve fraud detection and maximize the use of extensive data generated within the insurance ecosystem for prediction, learning, and strategic planning. The concept of an AI-data aggregation-level smart contract, introduced here, holds promise for broad application across various blockchain platforms, not limited to our discussion on healthcare claims insurance adjudication.",

We discuss how AI and CI are influencing e.g. how we humans gather information, build relationships, and communicate with others, with and without the new frontline technologies. Additionally, proposals for future advances are discussed along with the ethical and societal ramifications these technologies have, could and might bring into our lives. We think that by developing a deeper knowledge of how AI/CI affects human cognition and social interaction, new contributions are made to a positive conversation and encourage a responsible approach to incorporating new technologies into our daily lives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article proposes the so-called large user interface models (LUIMs) to enable the generation of user interfaces and prediction of usability using artificial intelligence in the context of mobile applications. To this end, we synergized an integrated framework for the effective testing of the usability of mobile applications following a selective review of the most influential models of mobile usability testing. Next, we identified and analysed 13 recent AI tools that generate user interfaces for mobile apps, and systematically tested these tools to identify their AI capabilities. Our striking findings demonstrate that current generative UI tools fail to address mobile usability attributes, such as efficiency, learnability, effectiveness, satisfaction, and memorability. Our large UI modelsâ architecture proposes to leverage the capabilities of large language models, large vision models, and large code models to overcome the challenges of AI-driven UI/UX design and front-end implementations. This fascinating UI eco-system must be augmented with sufficient UI data and multi-sensory input regarding user behaviour to train the models. We anticipate LUIMs to create ample opportunities, like expedited frontend software development, enhanced personalised user experience, and wider accessibility of smart technologies. However, the research challenges hindering the UI generation and usability prediction of mobile apps include the seamless integration of complex generative AI models, semantic understanding of non-uniform visual designs, scarcity of UX datasets, and modelling of realistic user interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and KendallâTheil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (Ï = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (Ï = â.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking.",

Hence, simplified workflow and automated analysis of urine elements are of absolute necessities. In the present work, a novel lab-on-chip cartridge (Gravity Sedimentation Cartridge) for the auto analysis of urine elements is developed. The GSC consists of a capillary chamber that uptakes a raw urine sample by capillary force and performs particles and cells enrichment within 5 min through a gravity sedimentation process for the microscopic examination. Centrifugation, which is necessary for enrichment in the conventional method, was circumvented in this approach. The AI100 device (Image based autoanalyzer) captures microscopic images from the cartridge at 40x magnification and uploads them into the cloud. Further, these images were auto-analyzed using an AI-based object detection model, which delivers the reports. These reports were available for expert review on a web-based platform that enables evidence-based tele reporting. A comparative analysis was carried out for various analytical parameters of the data generated through GSC (manual microscopy, tele reporting, and AI model) with the gold standard method. The presented approach makes it a viable product for automated urinalysis in point-of-care and large-scale settings.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (123KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

As GenAI technology can produce various forms of contents, organizations must face ethical dilemmas as to where this technology is likely to be used. Organizations do not want to compromise their ethical standards and compliance policies. Against this backdrop, the aim of this study is to examine if GenAI technology could improve the future performance of the organizations. This study deployed ethical dilemmas and environmental dynamism as two moderators acting on different linkages between adoption of GenAI and organizational future performance. With the help of literature review and theories, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually which was validated using PLS-SEM technique with the feedback of 326 responses from different types of organizations. This study found that the adoption of GenAI could improve exploratory and exploitative innovation under the moderating effects of environmental dynamism and ethical dilemmas. Moreover, it highlighted that the application of GenAI could improve organizational performance.",

There have been several successful AI models for predicting the Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system in power plants and large boilers. However, all these models are in essence black box models and lack of explainability, which are not able to give new knowledge. In this study, a novel explainable AI (XAI) model that combines the polynomial kernel method with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model is proposed to find the governing equation of SNCR system based on 5-year operation data from a power plant. This proposed model identifies the system's governing equation in a simple polynomial format with polynomial order of 1 and only 1 independent variable among original 68 input variables. In addition, the explainable AI model achieves a considerable accuracy with less than 21 % deviation from base-line models of partial least squares model and artificial neural network model.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (213KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLaw enforcement agencies manually transcribe thousands of investigative interviews per year in relation to different crimes. In order to automate and improve efficiency in the transcription of such interviews, applied research explores artificial intelligence models, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing. While AI models can improve efficiency in criminal investigations, their successful implementation requires evaluation of legal and technical risks.\nThis paper explores the legal and technical challenges of applying ASR models to investigative interviews in the context of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). The AIA provisions are discussed in the view of domain specific studies for interviews in the Norwegian police, best practices, and empirical analyses in speech recognition in order to provide law enforcement with a practical code of conduct on the techno-legal requirements for the adoption of such models in their work and potential grey areas for further research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly support human decision-making in fields like medicine, management, and finance. However, such human-AI (HAI) collaboration is often less effective than AI systems alone. Moreover, efforts to make AI recommendations more transparent have failed to improve the decision quality of HAI collaborations. Based on dual process theories of cognition, we hypothesized that suboptimal HAI collaboration is partly due to heuristic information processing of humans, creating a trust imbalance towards the AI system. In an online experiment with 337 participants, we investigated motivation and accuracy information as potential factors to induce more deliberate elaboration of AI recommendations, and thus improve HAI collaboration. Participants worked on a simulated personnel selection task and received recommendations from a simulated AI system. Participants' motivation was varied through gamification, and accuracy information through additional information from the AI system. Results indicate that both motivation and accuracy information positively influenced HAI performance, but in different ways. While high motivation primarily increased humansâ use in high-quality recommendations only, accuracy information improved both the use of low- and high-quality recommendations. However, a combination of high motivation and accuracy information did not yield additional improvement of HAI performance.",

    "abstract": "Digital forensics aims to uncover evidence of cybercrimes within compromised systems. These cybercrimes are often perpetrated through the deployment of malware, which inevitably leaves discernible traces within the compromised systems. Forensic analysts are tasked with extracting and subsequently analyzing data, termed as artifacts, from these systems to gather evidence. Therefore, forensic analysts must sift through extensive datasets to isolate pertinent evidence. However, manually identifying suspicious traces among numerous artifacts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Previous studies addressed such inefficiencies by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into digital forensics. Despite the efforts in previous studies, artifacts were analyzed without considering the nature of the data within them and failed to prove their efficiency through specific evaluations. In this study, we propose a system to prioritize suspicious artifacts from compromised systems infected with malware to facilitate efficient digital forensics. Our system introduces a double-checking method that recognizes the nature of data within target artifacts and employs algorithms ideal for anomaly detection. The key ideas of this method are: (1) prioritize suspicious artifacts and filter remaining artifacts using autoencoder and (2) further prioritize suspicious artifacts and filter remaining artifacts using logarithmic entropy. Our evaluation demonstrates that our system can identify malicious artifacts with high accuracy and that its double-checking method is more efficient than alternative approaches. Our system can significantly reduce the time required for forensic analysis and serve as a reference for future studies.",

To solve this problem, this study aims to develop an automatic pick-and-place robot system that alleviates labor demands in pumpkin harvesting. We proposed a system capable of detecting pumpkins in the field and obtaining their three-dimensional (3D) coordinate values using artificial intelligence (AI) object detection methods and RGB-D camera, respectively. The harvesting system incorporates a crawler-type vehicle as the base platform, while a collaborative robot arm is employed to lift the pumpkin fruits. A newly designed robot hand, mounted at the end of the robot arm, is responsible for grasping the pumpkins. In this paper, we utilized various versions of YOLO (from version 2 to 8) for pumpkin fruit detection, and compare the results obtained from these different versions. The RGB-D camera, that was mounted at the root of the robot arm, captures the position of the pumpkin fruits in camera coordinates. We proposed a calibration method can simply transform the position to the coordinates of robot arm. In addition, we finished all the software and hardware of the pumpkin fruits pick-and-place robot system. Field experiments were conducted at an outdoor pumpkin field. The experiments demonstrate the fruits detection accuracy rate exceeding 99% and a picking success rate surpassing 90%. However, fruits that were surrounded by excessive vines could not be successfully grasped.",

Consumer behavior modeling is critical in user interest learning and has been extensively used in recommender systems to improve recommendation accuracy. This paper proposes a novel AI-empowered consumer behavior analysis method for trustworthy track recommendations over musical dance electronic products. Specifically, we first model consumer behavior by integrating collaborative filtering and a hidden Markov model to capture the key interactive patterns between consumers and musical dance electronic products. Then, we develop a trustworthy track recommendation method based on multi-layer attention representation learning, which leverages scattering transform for audio preprocessing and attention-based independent recurrent neural networks for encoding user preferences and product features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of recommendation accuracy and trustworthiness.",

Past research often investigates the capability of AI to perform âhumanâ tasks in structured application fields. Yet, there is a lack of research that systematically analyzes when and how AI can be used for the more complex and unstructured tasks of open innovation (OI). We present a framework for leveraging AI-enabled applications to foster productive OI collaborations. Specifically, we create a 3x3 matrix by aligning the three OI stages (initiation, development, realization) with the three management functions of AI (mapping, coordinating, controlling). This matrix assists in identifying how various AI applications may augment or automate human intelligence, thereby helping to resolve prevailing OI challenges. It provides guidance on how organizations can use AI to establish, execute and govern exchanges across the OI stages. Finally, we lay out an agenda for future research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDrawing sound causal inferences from observational data is often challenging for both authors and reviewers. This paper discusses the design and application of an Artificial Intelligence Causal Research Assistant (AIA) that seeks to help authors improve causal inferences and conclusions drawn from epidemiological data in health risk assessments. The AIA-assisted review process provides structured reviews and recommendations for improving the causal reasoning, analyses and interpretations made in scientific papers based on epidemiological data. Causal analysis methodologies range from earlier Bradford-Hill considerations to current causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) and related models. AIA seeks to make these methods more accessible and useful to researchers. AIA uses an external script (a âCausal AI Boosterâ (CAB) program based on classical AI concepts of slot-filling in frames organized into task hierarchies to complete goals) to guide Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's LaMDA (Bard), to systematically review manuscripts and create both (a) recommendations for what to do to improve analyses and reporting; and (b) explanations and support for the recommendations. Review tables and summaries are completed systematically by the LLM in order. For example, recommendations for how to state and caveat causal conclusions in the Abstract and Discussion sections reflect previous analyses of the Study Design and Data Analysis sections. This work illustrates how current AI can contribute to reviewing and providing constructive feedback on research documents. We believe that such AI-assisted review shows promise for enhancing the quality of causal reasoning and exposition in epidemiological studies. It suggests the potential for effective human-AI collaboration in scientific authoring and review processes.",

This paper uses generative AI to analyze and identify which provider types and HCPC codes are most strongly associated with these errors. The paper employs generative AI to produce two Python codes: one generates a time-series trend graph of Medicare improper payments from 2010 to 2022, and the other calculates the number of payment errors by provider type and HCPC code. These codes are designed for novice and non-programmers. Three datasets are used, such as Medicare Fee-for-Service Comprehensive Error Rate Testing dataset released on March 8, 2023, merged codes such as HCPC codes and PCT codes. The result suggests what systems should be improved to reduce Medicare improper payments. Generative AI is being introduced to help novice and non-programmers analyze Medicare improper payments with datasets, aiding researchers in conducting similar tasks in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the Ontology Learning research domain, despite recent advancements, the performance of current non or semi-supervised approaches for concept formation remains sub-optimal, particularly from a single, small-sized corpus for a specialized domain. In order to answer the performance drawback, this paper introduces a novel pipeline, called CO-ISSC (Core Ontology-based Incremental Semi-Supervised Clustering), for concept formation towards ontology learning. This pipeline uses a PLM (Pre-trained Language Model) and combines in an incremental manner a semi-supervised dimension reduction technique and a clustering technique, guided by core concepts as prior knowledge to align results with the ontology domain. Its incremental nature enhances prior knowledge and boosts its performance. The CO-ISSC pipelineâs performance is evaluated on the recent and significant AI Act text established by the European Union, which aims to ensure the safety, transparency, and non-discrimination of AI systems. To this end, we manually built a benchmark terminology for the AI Act domain given that no reference model exists yet. The results demonstrate promising performance of the CO-ISSC pipeline, outperforming baseline non-supervised or semi-supervised approaches such as DBSCAN, similarity measure based approaches, support vector machines and ANN.",

Malaysia is a member of ASEAN (Association of South-east Asian Nations), and ASEAN is increasing the use of renewable energy by 2050 to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Coal is Malaysia's primary fossil fuel for energy generation, producing large amounts of CO2 and exacerbating greenhouse problems, including air pollution. Moreover, renewable energy capacity has increased significantly worldwide since 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study provides an energy-outlook study from 1990 to 2050 as a rationale for Malaysia's emphasis on sustainable energy in the post-COVID-19 years, which has been felt to be absent in previous studies. Here, past data as well as projections of future coal trade, hydropower growth, electricity consumption, renewable energy consumption, and CO2 emissions are shown. An energy-outlook procedure is explored by reviewing the literature to derive data visualizations and projections. Business-as-usual (BAU) and Alternative-policy Scenarios (APS) methods have been used for projections. The article prioritizes coal since coal is the main fossil fuel for electricity generation in Malaysia. The study observed a significant increase in CO2 emissions with increasing energy demand in Malaysia, which is a concern, and the article emphasized the importance of renewable energy in mitigating CO2 emissions. Finally, Long-short-term memory (LSTM) has been used as an initial experiment on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used in the energy outlook study, which indicates the research scope of AI.",

Task scheduling is the most fundamental problem in the IoMT-cloud since cloud execution commonly relies on it. Thus, a proposition is being made for a distinct scheduling technique to suitably meet these solicitations. To manage the scheduling issue, an artificial intelligence (AI) method known as a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed. The proposed AI method will be justified by contrasting it with other traditional optimization and AI scheduling approaches. The CloudSim is utilized to quantify its effect on various parameters like time, resource utilization, cost, and throughput. The proposed AI technique enhanced the viability of task scheduling with a better execution rate of 32.47âms and a reduced time of 40.16âms. Thus, the experimented outcomes show that the HGA reduces cost as well as time profoundly.",

Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for better treatment outcomes and improved survival rates. However, high incidence of breast cancer puts a significant burden on clinicians, while training experienced breast imaging clinicians is time-consuming. This raises the need for developing a robust AI assistant for assisting clinicians for breast cancer diagnosis. To this end, we collected a very large set of breast DCE-MRI data from seven medical centers for developing such a breast AI assistant, which can also be used as a foundational step for building an automated breast cancer diagnosis system to facilitate future smart medicine.\nSummary\nDynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) allows screening, follow up, and diagnosis for breast tumor with high sensitivity. Accurate tumor segmentation from DCE-MRI can provide crucial information of tumor location and shape, which significantly influences the downstream clinical decisions. In this paper, we aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant to automatically segment breast tumors by capturing dynamic changes in multi-phase DCE-MRI with a spatial-temporal framework. The main advantages of our AI assistant include (1) robustness, i.e., our model can handle MR data with different phase numbers and imaging intervals, as demonstrated on a large-scale dataset from seven medical centers, and (2) efficiency, i.e., our AI assistant significantly reduces the time required for manual annotation by a factor of 20, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of physicians. More importantly, as the fundamental step to build an AI-assisted breast cancer diagnosis system, our AI assistant will promote the application of AI in more clinical diagnostic practices regarding breast cancer.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (251KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Historic reads of three radiologists were used as radiologist interpretation. A commercially-available AI-CAD was used for analysis. One radiologist not involved in interpretation had retrospectively reviewed the abnormality features and assessed the significance (negligible vs. need recall) of the AI-CAD marks. Ground truth in terms of cancer, benign or absence of abnormality was confirmed according to histopathologic diagnosis or negative results on the next-round screen.\nResults\nOf the 6499 mammograms, 6282 (96.7%) were in the negative, 189 (2.9%) were in the benign, and 28 (0.4%) were in the cancer group. AI-CAD detected 5 (17.9%, 5 of 28) of the 9 cancers that were intially interpreted as negative. Of the 648 AI-CAD recalls, 89.0% (577 of 648) were marks seen on examinations in the negative group, and 267 (41.2%) of the AI-CAD marks were considered to be negligible. Stand-alone AI-CAD has significantly higher recall rates (10.0% vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001) with comparable sensitivity and cancer detection rates (P = 0.086 and 0.102, respectively) when compared to the radiologistsâ interpretation.\nConclusion\nAI-CAD detected 17.9% additional cancers on screening mammography that were initially overlooked by the radiologists. In spite of the additional cancer detection, AI-CAD had significantly higher recall rates in the clinical workflow, in which 89.0% of AI-CAD marks are on negative mammograms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article (a) draws from various theories of creativity (e.g., 4P and 6P theories) and (b) uses several concepts from the creativity literature (e.g., self-actualization, emergence) to evaluate the claim that AI can be creative. This approach suggests that, at most, the output of AI represents products which, although lacking, may be attributed with creativity. Such attributions are often mistaken, and, significantly, products say little about the underlying process. Indeed, criticisms previously leveled at the view that the social recognition of products is required of creativity also apply to AI output. Several examples of products and overt actions that have been mistakenly attributed with creativity are discussed. The most telling of these is the ostensible emergence by a machine. The conclusion is that it makes no sense to refer to âcreative AI.â One alternative is to extend the concept of âartificial intelligenceâ to creativity, which gives us âartificial creativityâ as the label for what computers can do. Artificial creativity may be original and effective but it lacks several things that characterize human creativity. Thus it may be the most accurate to recognize that the output of AI as a kind of pseudo-creativity.",

AI-based aortic diameters at eight guideline compliant positions were compared with manual measurements. In 90 examinations (30 per group) diameters were reassessed for intra- and inter-reader variability, which was compared to discrepancy of the AI system using Bland-Altman analysis, paired samples t-testing and linear mixed models.\nResults\nWe analyzed 240 participants (63 Â± 16 years; 50 % men). AI evaluation failed in 11 cases due to incorrect segmentation (4.6 %), leaving 229 cases for analysis. No difference was found in aortic diameter between manual and automatic measurements (32.7 Â± 6.4 mm vs 32.7 Â± 6.0 mm, p = 0.70). Bland-Altman analysis yielded no systematic bias and a repeatability coefficient of 4.0 mm for AI. Mean discrepancy of AI (1.3 Â± 1.6 mm) was comparable to inter-reader variability (1.4 Â± 1.4 mm); only at the proximal aortic arch showed AI higher discrepancy (2.0 Â± 1.8 mm vs 0.9 Â± 0.9 mm, p < 0.001). No difference between AI discrepancy and inter-reader variability was found for any subgroup (all: p > 0.05).\nConclusion\nThe AI software can accurately measure thoracic aortic diameters, with discrepancy to a human reader similar to inter-reader variability in a range from normal to dilated aortas.",

While these systems offer great potential benefits to institutional decision-making processes, such as improved efficiency and reliability, these systems face the challenge of aligning machine learning (ML) models with the complex realities of public sector decision-making. In this paper, we examine five key challenges where misalignment can occur, including distribution shifts, label bias, the influence of past decision-making on the data side, as well as competing objectives and human-in-the-loop on the model output side. Our findings suggest that standard ML methods often rely on assumptions that do not fully account for these complexities, potentially leading to unreliable and harmful predictions. To address this, we propose a shift in modeling efforts from focusing solely on predictive accuracy to improving decision-making outcomes. We offer guidance for selecting appropriate modeling frameworks, including counterfactual prediction and policy learning, by considering how the model estimand connects to the decision-maker's utility. Additionally, we outline technical methods that address specific challenges within each modeling approach. Finally, we argue for the importance of external input from domain experts and stakeholders to ensure that model assumptions and design choices align with real-world policy objectives, taking a step towards harmonizing AI and public sector objectives.",

Specifically, AI has shown huge potential for automating and modeling the threat detection mechanism of complicated wireless systems. The current data-driven AI systems, however, lack transparency and accountability in their decisions, and assuring the reliability and trustworthiness of the data collected from participating entities is an important obstacle to threat detection and decision-making. To this end, we integrate smart contracts with eXplainable AI (XAI) to design a robust cybersecurity framework for ZTN. The proposed framework uses a blockchain and smart contract-enabled access control and authentication mechanism to ensure trust among the participating entities. Additionally, with the collected data, we designed Digital Twins (DTs) for simulating the attack detection operation in the ZTN environment. Specifically, to provide a platform for analysis and the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the DTs are equipped with a variety of process-aware attack scenarios. A Self Attention-based Long Short Term Memory (SALSTM) network is used to evaluate the attack detection capabilities of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the explainability of the proposed AI-based IDS is achieved using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool.

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nAn ADR-DCLC strategy is proposed for the modular multilevel converter-based voltage source converters (MMC-VSCs) in an MTDC system.\nâ¢\nThe data-driven model is developed to reflect the direct mapping relationship between ADR parameters and dynamic performance index.\nâ¢\nAn AI-aided parameter optimization method is implemented.\nAbstract\nThe significant penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) makes the AC/DC hybrid system a typical low-inertia and poor-damping system. The multi-terminal direct current system (MTDC) is critical in connecting multiple AC systems and transferring bulk power among different AC regions. Conventional control often involves a tradeoff between response time and damping oscillations. To solve these issues, an AI-designed adaptive dynamic reference (ADR) control is investigated in this paper. It is designed with a controllable settling time and is able to mitigate the power oscillation during step change of power reference. In detail, an ADR module is utilized to generate the reference signal, which is input to dual closed-loop control. Raw data is generated from the simulation to build a data-driven surrogate model to map ADR parameters directly to settling time and overshoot in dynamic response. Once the surrogate model is trained, it is able to evaluate VSCâs dynamic performance within 0.003s, which is much faster in comparison with online simulation. A meta-heuristic optimization method is then adopted to find the optimal control parameters based on the surrogate model. The effectiveness of the proposed ADR control and its AI-aided parameter design is validated by the real-time digital simulation and hardware-in-loop experiment.",

In an online experiment (N = 128), participants performed a visual estimation task in a simulated medical setting (i.e., estimate the percentage of bacteria in a visual stimulus). All participants were supported by an AI that gave perfect recommendations for all but one color of bacteria (i.e., error-prone color with 50% reliability). We manipulated between-subjects whether participants knew about the error-prone color (XAI condition) or not (nonXAI condition). The analyses revealed that participants showed higher trust behavior (i.e., lower deviation from the AI recommendation) for the non-error-prone trials in the XAI condition. Moreover, participants showed lower trust behavior for the error-prone color in the XAI condition than in the nonXAI condition. However, this behavioral adaptation only applied to the subset of error-prone trials in which the AI gave correct recommendations, and not to the actual erroneous trials. Thus, designing explainable AI systems can also come with inadequate behavioral adaptations, as explainability was associated with benefits (i.e., more adequate behavior in non-error-prone trials), but also costs (stronger changes to the AI recommendations in correct error-prone trials).",

We adopt a network effects (NEs) perspective to conceptualize AI strategies, highlighting the AI contextâs specifics. We argue that nascent AI strategiesâ success depends on data NEs: companies establishing a functional ârunning systemâ to capitalize on these effects. However, this presents a challenge known as the cold-start problem (CSP), which involves initiating and accelerating a virtuous cycle: more data benefits the AI system, enhancing performance, which then attracts more data. In this paper, we examine the CSP in nascent AI strategy, exploring how it can be understood in terms of its technological and business dimensions and ultimately be overcome to kick-start a virtuous cycle of data NEs. By drawing insights from existing literature and practitioner interviews, we present a research agenda to encourage further investigation into overcoming the CSP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEnvironmental pollution remains one of the foremost existential threats to human well-being, despite the concerted efforts and implementation of various programmes aimed at fostering cleaner air. The contemporary global economic and energy landscape, characterised by multifaceted challenges, has undeniably hindered the efficacy of efforts to kerb air pollutant emissions. Solid fuels persist as primary sources of energy production in numerous countries, serving both the residential and industrial sectors. However, combustion of such fuels, particularly within domestic heating units (DHUs), engenders the release of a diverse array of organic compounds characterised by intricate structures and potent mutagenic and environmentally hazardous properties.\nHowever, the combustion process, if properly regulated, can be carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner. The intricate interplay of myriad factors that influence the composition and quality of chimney flue gases underscores the complexity inherent in controlling the combustion process. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a versatile tool with applications that span various domains, including environmental monitoring systems. In this study, we posit the utilisation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a sophisticated data mining technique to control the emission of flue gases contingent on the specific boiler and fuel utilised. Feed forward predictive models with back propagation were utilized for AI-based data mining aiming at the prediction of the concentration of flue gas components. The highest coefficients of model fit goodness were obtained for CO2, NOx and SO2 with R2 equal to 0.99, 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. The study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using AI-based data mining to predict emissions from conventional energy technologies. By leveraging the predictive capabilities of ANNs, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of solid fuel combustion, contributing to cleaner air and improved public health.",

The investigation consists of Resonant Column (RC), Cyclic Torsional Shear (CTS), and Cyclic Triaxial (CTx) tests performed on 25 specimens of fine-grained soils retrieved from 11 sites in Sicily (South Italy). To develop accurate predictive models of soil dynamic properties, essential for site response analyses and dynamic soil-structure interaction, various regression techniques were applied. These techniques range from Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to more complex AI methods, specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based on FeedForward Neural networks (FFN). Three predictive models were developed to derive strain-dependent shear modulus (G), damping ratio (D), and normalized shear modulus (G/G0), using four inputs: shear strain (Î³), plasticity index (PI), confining pressure (pâ0), and the Over Consolidation Ratio (OCR). To determine the optimal FFN topology, 1350 networks were developed by varying hidden layers (1â3), hidden neurons (1â50 per layer), and activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent). Hybrid FFN optimised through Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization techniques were also investigated. Single-hidden layer networks with fewer than 15 neurons provided acceptable predictions (R2test of 0.97 for G-Î³, 0.93 for G/G0-Î³, and 0.85 for D-Î³ models). Multiple-hidden layer networks yielded higher accuracy for G and D models but are more complex for practical use. The FFN models outperformed MLR and other established empirical formulations, highlighting the site-specificity of the modelling parameters of the latter.",

However, current control methods rely significantly on human expertise and experience, making process availability and stability difficult to ensure. The semisolid casting process is more complicated than conventional liquid casting due to the additional casting parameters incorporated during the slurry preparation, which can have an effect on the quality of the final product. Therefore, an efficient tool is required to simplify the complete process of semisolid casting. The introduction of an AI system to aid in the supervision of the casting manufacturing procedure is one potential solution. This paper introduces a new casting system named âSmart-Castâ developed for this specific purpose. The paper describes the functions of the system and its current development process. Using an AI system as an assistant can help to achieve the goal of enhancing the efficacy of casting process control, and it can also help foundries step into the Industry 4.0 era.",

Deep learning offers a promising solution by enabling early and accurate detection of leaf diseases. This study presents a novel deep-learning model designed to address the challenges of real-world leaf disease identification. To enhance the model's robustness, we incorporated six datasets (LD, LD1, LD2, LD3, LD4, LD5) which include image augmentation techniques, like flipped versions (LD1) and controlled noise (LD2, LD3). Additionally, we introduced new datasets with additional noise types (LD4) and real-world scenarios (LD5). To further improve accuracy, we employed an ensemble approach, combining MobileNetV3_Small and EfficientNetV2B3 with weighted voting. Our model achieved exceptional performance, surpassing 94 % accuracy on imbalanced data (LD) and exceeding 99 % on balanced, high-quality data (LD1). Even in noisy environments (LD2, LD3, LD4, LD5), our model consistently outperformed other approaches, maintaining an accuracy rate above 90 %. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we utilized Explainable AI (LIME) to visualize the model's decision-making process. These results demonstrate the potential of our model as a reliable and accurate tool for leaf disease detection in practical agricultural settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRobustness analysis of text Classification models through adversarial attacks has gained substantial attention in recent research. This area studies the consistent behavior of text Classification models under attacks. These attacks use perturbation methods based on applying semantic and label-preserving changes to the inputs. However, the fragmented landscape of individual attack implementations, dispersed across code repositories, poses complicates the development and application of comprehensive adversarial strategies for model enhancement. To address these challenges, this paper introduces AI-Q, a Python framework specifically designed for text Classification adversarial attacks and data augmentation. One of the major strengths of our framework lies in its extensive library of perturbation methods for adversarial attacks (24 in total), and its evaluation metrics for model robustness. The framework exhibits versatility by supporting both custom models and those from the HuggingFace ecosystem, ensuring broad compatibility with leading benchmarks in the field. Beyond adversarial attacks, AI-Q can be used for data augmentation, enabling users to harness the components of adversarial attacks to increase dataset diversity. Finally, our evaluation, including human annotations, highlights the AI-Q potential for model robustness.",

When it comes to docking, however, they typically serve a secondary role, whereas the main work is done by active sensors such as lidar. This paper documents the development of a proposed AI-based (artificial intelligence) navigation algorithm intending to mature the use of on-board visible wavelength cameras as a main sensor for docking and on-orbit servicing (OOS), reducing the dependency on lidar and greatly reducing costs. Specifically, the use of AI enables the expansion of the relative navigation solution towards multiple classes of scenarios, e.g., in terms of targets or illumination conditions, which would otherwise have to be crafted on a case-by-case manner using classical image processing methods. Multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone architectures are benchmarked on synthetically generated data of docking manoeuvres with the International Space Station (ISS), achieving position and attitude estimates close to 1 % range-normalised and 1 deg, respectively, an established rule of thumb for the navigation measurement accuracy during final approach. The integration of the solution with a physical prototype of the refuelling mechanism is validated in laboratory using a robotic arm to simulate a berthing procedure.",

Therefore, this research investigates how people react to biased GAI-content based on their pre-existing political beliefs and how this influences the acceptance of GAI. In three experiments (N = 513), it was found that perceived alignment between user's political orientation and bias in generated content (in text and images) increases acceptance and reliance on GAI. Participants who perceived alignment were more likely to grant GAI access to sensitive smartphone functions and to endorse the use in critical domains (e.g., loan approval; social media moderation). Because users see GAI as a social actor, they consider perceived alignment as a sign of greater objectivity, thus granting aligned GAI access to more sensitive areas.",

For the diagnosis of follicular thyroid nodules, however, FNAC has limitations. FNAC can classify them only as Bethesda IV nodules, leaving their exact malignant status and pathological type undetermined. This imprecise diagnosis creates difficulties in selecting the follow-up treatment. In this retrospective study, we collected ultrasound (US) image data of Bethesda IV thyroid nodules from 2006 to 2022 from five hospitals. Then, US image-based artificial intelligence (AI) models were trained to identify the specific category of Bethesda IV thyroid nodules. We tested the models using two independent datasets, and the best AI model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) between 0.90 and 0.95, demonstrating its potential value for clinical application. Our research findings indicate that AI could change the diagnosis and management process of Bethesda IV thyroid nodules.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (192KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) symptom checker models should be trained using real-world patient data to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Given that AI-based symptom checkers are currently used in clinical practice, their performance should improve over time. However, longitudinal evaluations of the diagnostic accuracy of these symptom checkers are limited.\nObjective\nThis study aimed to assess the longitudinal changes in the accuracy of differential diagnosis lists created by an AI-based symptom checker used in the real world.\nMethods\nThis was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Patients who visited an outpatient clinic without an appointment between May 1, 2019, and April 30, 2022, and who were admitted to a community hospital in Japan within 30 days of their index visit were considered eligible. We only included patients who underwent an AI-based symptom checkup at the index visit, and the diagnosis was finally confirmed during follow-up. Final diagnoses were categorized as common or uncommon, and all cases were categorized as typical or atypical. The primary outcome measure was the accuracy of the differential diagnosis list created by the AI-based symptom checker, defined as the final diagnosis in a list of 10 differential diagnoses created by the symptom checker. To assess the change in the symptom checkerâs diagnostic accuracy over 3 years, we used a chi-square test to compare the primary outcome over 3 periods: from May 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020 (first year); from May 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021 (second year); and from May 1, 2021, to April 30, 2022 (third year).\nResults\nA total of 381 patients were included. Common diseases comprised 257 (67.5%) cases, and typical presentations were observed in 298 (78.2%) cases. Overall, the accuracy of the differential diagnosis list created by the AI-based symptom checker was 172 (45.1%), which did not differ across the 3 years (first year: 97/219, 44.3%; second year: 32/72, 44.4%; and third year: 43/90, 47.7%; P=.85). The accuracy of the differential diagnosis list created by the symptom checker was low in those with uncommon diseases (30/124, 24.2%) and atypical presentations (12/83, 14.5%). In the multivariate logistic regression model, common disease (P<.001; odds ratio 4.13, 95% CI 2.50-6.98) and typical presentation (P<.001; odds ratio 6.92, 95% CI 3.62-14.2) were significantly associated with the accuracy of the differential diagnosis list created by the symptom checker.\nConclusions\nA 3-year longitudinal survey of the diagnostic accuracy of differential diagnosis lists developed by an AI-based symptom checker, which has been implemented in real-world clinical practice settings, showed no improvement over time. Uncommon diseases and atypical presentations were independently associated with a lower diagnostic accuracy. In the future, symptom checkers should be trained to recognize uncommon conditions.",

Aimed at bolstering the Kingdom's Vision 2030, the study focuses on the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced communication technologies to optimize traffic management in Mecca. Through the innovative deployment of smart cameras and real-time data analytics, the proposed system seeks to predict, manage, and alleviate traffic congestion by providing alternative routes and facilitating smoother vehicular movement. An exploration into the myriad benefits of this AI-integrated system reveals potentials such as enhanced road safety, improved emergency response efficiencies, and elevated air quality, thereby contributing to the overall wellbeing of the community and environment. In addition, the research anticipates that reducing traffic bottlenecks will indirectly invigorate local businesses and augment tourism revenues, aligning with the objectives of enhancing economic prosperity. By advocating a multi-faceted approach to crowd monitoring and management, this study underscores the indispensable role of AI in revolutionizing traffic management strategies, despite the challenges posed by the complexity of real-time data simulation and the unique intricacies of the Hajj.",

    "abstract": "Background\nPatients after kidney transplantation eventually face the risk of graft loss with the concomitant need for dialysis or retransplantation. Choosing the right kidney replacement therapy after graft loss is an important preference-sensitive decision for kidney transplant recipients. However, the rate of conversations about treatment options after kidney graft loss has been shown to be as low as 13% in previous studies. It is unknown whether the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)âbased risk prediction models can increase the number of conversations about treatment options after graft loss and how this might influence the associated shared decision-making (SDM).\nObjective\nThis study aims to explore the impact of AI-based risk prediction for the risk of graft loss on the frequency of conversations about the treatment options after graft loss, as well as the associated SDM process.\nMethods\nThis is a 2-year, prospective, randomized, 2-armed, parallel-group, single-center trial in a German kidney transplant center. All patients will receive the same routine postâkidney transplant care that usually includes follow-up visits every 3 months at the kidney transplant center. For patients in the intervention arm, physicians will be assisted by a validated and previously published AI-based risk prediction system that estimates the risk for graft loss in the next year, starting from 3 months after randomization until 24 months after randomization. The study population will consist of 122 kidney transplant recipients >12 months after transplantation, who are at least 18 years of age, are able to communicate in German, and have an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients with multi-organ transplantation, or who are not able to communicate in German, as well as underage patients, cannot participate. For the primary end point, the proportion of patients who have had a conversation about their treatment options after graft loss is compared at 12 months after randomization. Additionally, 2 different assessment tools for SDM, the CollaboRATE mean score and the Control Preference Scale, are compared between the 2 groups at 12 months and 24 months after randomization. Furthermore, recordings of patient-physician conversations, as well as semistructured interviews with patients, support persons, and physicians, are performed to support the quantitative results.\nResults\nThe enrollment for the study is ongoing. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2025.\nConclusions\nThis is the first study to examine the influence of AI-based risk prediction on physician-patient interaction in the context of kidney transplantation. We use a mixed methods approach by combining a randomized design with a simple quantitative end point (frequency of conversations), different quantitative measurements for SDM, and several qualitative research methods (eg, records of physician-patient conversations and semistructured interviews) to examine the implementation of AI-based risk prediction in the clinic.\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT06056518; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06056518\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nPRR1-10.2196/54857",

Exposure to substances like hexavalent chromium, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory problems and lung cancer. Continuous monitoring and timely intervention are crucial to mitigate these risks. Traditional air quality monitoring methods often lack real-time data analysis and predictive capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in addressing pollution hazards proactively. This paper introduces a real-time air pollution monitoring and forecasting system specifically designed for the chrome plating industry. The system, supported by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and AI approaches, detects a wide range of air pollutants, including NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, SO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10, and provides real-time data on pollutant concentration levels. Data collected by the sensors are processed using LSTM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models to predict pollution levels. The LSTM model achieved a coefficient of variation (RÂ²) of 99â¯% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAE) of 0.33 for temperature and humidity forecasting. For PM2.5, the Random Forest model outperformed others, achieving an RÂ² of 84â¯% and an MAE of 10.11. The system activates factory exhaust fans to circulate air when high pollution levels are predicted to occur in the next hours, allowing for proactive measures to improve air quality before issues arise. This innovative approach demonstrates significant advancements in industrial environmental monitoring, enabling dynamic responses to pollution and improving air quality in industrial settings.",

In total, 65 students participated in a semester-long study. Classes were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 20) or a control group (n = 45). As part of their language learning, the experimental group engaged in communicative activities with an AI chatbot eight times in class, while the control group engaged in conventional communicative activities. Data collection involved administering the WTC questionnaire. Additionally, the experimental group voluntarily participated in semi-structured interviews. An independent sample t-test revealed no statistically significant difference in WTC levels between the two groups at the beginning of the semester (t(63) = â0.016, p = .987). However, the ANCOVA conducted after eight intervention sessions demonstrated significant improvements in WTC, reduced anxiety levels, and enhanced communication confidence among students in the experimental group (F(1, 62) = 393.740, p = .000). Analyses of the interviews revealed that students experienced decreased anxiety, enhancing their WTC in Korean. These findings suggested that chatbot-mediated interactions created a learner-friendly learning environment wherein learners displayed higher-level engagement and, consequently, an enhanced WTC in Korean.",

It is necessary to intervene at early stages to prevent future expenses. Leveraging rapid digitalisation to achieve the desired goals and bringing in âsmart manufacturingâ will benefit industries with large-scale productions. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance âdesign for manufacturability (DfM)â paradigm. Integrating digital twins and generative artificial intelligence (AI), a software is proposed that not only simulates real-world environments for testing and visualisation of potential processes but also provides designs to optimise the manufacturing process, maintain cost, and enhance the productâs appeal to the target market. The proposed model uses sensors to replicate the product in a digital environment to run a simulation. Meanwhile, a generative AI model embedded in the software provides creative and effective solutions based on user requirements and market data. When incorporated into the product development cycle, this process will ensure cost efficiency and improve the time required to develop quality products, enabling quicker launches. Thus, combining these emerging technologies yields a powerful, innovative model that enhances design for manufacturability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEdge-AI uses Artificial Intelligence algorithms directly embedded on a device, contrary to a remote AI that uses an AI on a cloud or remote server for prediction. Recent improvements in microcontroller computing capabilities and enhanced deep learning algorithms and conversion frameworks made it easier to run small AI models directly on microcontroller units. Is the current interest in on-device AI justified in terms of its energy consumption on resource-constrained devices when compared to AI on the cloud? This study presents how an embedded deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for real-time human activity recognition with more than 98% classification accuracy and its impact on battery life. Experiments conducted on a triaxial accelerometer with data collected and processed by an ARM Cortex-M4-based development board showed that energy consumption could be reduced up to 21% when inferences are run on an edge device versus using a remote server/cloud without compromising the overall classification precision and accuracy. We can reduce energy consumption by limiting data transmission by considering pseudo-real-time or non-real-time application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe emergence of pandemics poses a persistent threat to both global health and economic stability. While zoonotic spillovers and local outbreaks may not be fully preventable, early detection of infections in individuals before they spread to communities can make a major difference in containing an infectious disease and stopping it from becoming an epidemic and then a pandemic.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based pandemic prediction framework called iPREDICTâa concept framework designed to leverage the power of AI and crowd-sensed data for accurate and timely pandemic prediction. The core idea of iPREDICT is to leverage the deluge of data that can be harnessed from connected and wearable biosensing devices. iPREDICT system then works by monitoring anomalies in the biomarkers at the individual level and correlating them with similar anomalies observed in other members of the community. Using AI-based anomaly detection in conjunction with analysis of the spatiotemporal growth of the correlated anomalies, iPREDICT thus can potentially detect and monitor the emergence of a local outbreak in near real-time to predict a potential pandemic.\nHowever, not every outbreak has the potential to become a pandemic. We illustrate how tools like graph neural networks can be leveraged to determine optimal thresholds as a function of a large number of demographical, social, and geographical factors that determine the spatiotemporal spread of an outbreak, thus quantifying the risk of it becoming an epidemic or pandemic.\nWe also identify essential technological and social challenges that require attention to transform iPREDICT from an idea into a globally deployable solution for future pandemic prediction and management. To provide deeper insights into iPREDICT design challenges and trigger research towards possible solutions we present a COVID-19 based case study. The results signify the impact of variation in biosensing hardware, data sampling rate, and compression rate on the performance of AI models that underpin various components of the iPREDICT system.",

Akin to social loafing in human interaction, algorithmic loafing may occur when humans mindlessly adhere to machine recommendations due to reluctance to engage analytically with AI recommendations and explanations. We consider how algorithmic loafing could emerge and how to mitigate it. Specifically, we posit that algorithmic loafing can be induced through repeated encounters with correct decisions from the AI and transparency may combat it. As a form of transparency, explanation is offered for reasons that include justification, control, and discovery. However, algorithmic loafing is further reinforced by the perceived competence that an explanation provides. In this work, we explored these ideas via human subject experiments (n = 239). We also study how improving decision transparency through validation by an external human approver affects performance. Using eight experimental conditions in a high-stakes criminal justice context, we find that decision accuracy is typically unaffected by multiple forms of transparency but there is a significant difference in performance when the machine errs. Participants who saw explanations alone are better at overriding incorrect decisions; however, those under induced algorithmic loafing exhibit poor performance with variation in decision time. We conclude with recommendations on curtailing algorithmic loafing and achieving social facilitation, where task visibility motivates individuals to perform better.",

Over one-year, we prospectively evaluated the use of AI software to support the detection of intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVO) on CT angiography (CTA).\nMethod\nQuantitative measures (user log-in attempts, AI standalone performance) and qualitative data (user surveys) were reviewed by a key-user group at three timepoints. A total of 491 CTA studies of 460 patients were included for analysis.\nResults\nThe overall accuracy of the AI-tool for LVO detection and localization was 87.6%, sensitivity 69.1% and specificity 91.2%. Out of 81 LVOs, 31 of 34 (91%) M1 occlusions were detected correctly, 19 of 38 (50%) M2 occlusions, and 6 of 9 (67%) ICA occlusions. The product was considered user-friendly. The diagnostic confidence of the users for LVO detection remained the same over the year. The last measured net promotor score was â56%. The use of the AI-tool fluctuated over the year with a declining trend.\nConclusions\nOur pragmatic approach of evaluating the AI-tool used in clinical practice, helped us to monitor the usage, to estimate the perceived added value by the users of the AI-tool, and to make an informed decision about the continuation of the use of the AI-tool.",

Methods: The proposed ResTinyECG backbone consists of four-stage Res-blocks (2/4/3/2) with input ECG image sizes of 320 Ã 320 Ã 1 pixels and 160 Ã 160 Ã 1 pixels, with a significant parameter reduction of around 20 %/95 %/74 % compared to existing backbones like Shufflenet-v2/CSPDarknet53-tiny and the latest YOLOv7-tiny structure. Moreover, this study applied magnitude-based filter pruning and dependency graph (DepGraph) pruning for parameter optimization. The ECG images undergo processing with time-window lengths of 5/10/15/20 s, accompanied by minâmax normalization, and weighted loss is applied for class balance during learning, and non-maximum suppression with edge removal is used to compute and select the final output bounding boxes of ECG heartbeats. Experiments: Experiments conducted on the PhysioNet MIT-BIH arrhythmia ECG database focus on nine classes, including normal (N), atrial premature beat (A), ventricular premature beat (V), left bundle branch block (L), right bundle branch block (R), fusion of ventricular beat (FVN), paced beat (P), fusion of paced and normal beat (FPN), and others (remaining heartbeats). Results: The proposed ResTinyECG-320 exhibits impressive mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of 94.76 %/94.85 %/93.96 %/87.12 % in 6-class detection and 92.35 %/91.96 %/90.58 %/83.34 % in 9-class detection across different time-window lengths. The model demonstrates only a marginal 7 %â¼9% decrease in performance when utilizing longer time-window lengths. After applying magnitude-based filter pruning, ResTinyECG can be reduced to a minimal 0.1 million parameters. Furthermore, ResTinyECG-160 achieves a competitive mAP of 93.92 % in 6-class detection and a faster processing speed of 100.6 ECG segments per second (SPS) on a PC compared to Shufflenet-v2 (77.3 SPS). In conclusion, YOLO-ResTinyECG surpasses existing backbones, exhibiting superior mAP in both 6/9-class detection scenarios, and its deployment on an embedded AI platform validates its real-time detection capabilities.",

Akin to social loafing in human interaction, algorithmic loafing may occur when humans mindlessly adhere to machine recommendations due to reluctance to engage analytically with AI recommendations and explanations. We consider how algorithmic loafing could emerge and how to mitigate it. Specifically, we posit that algorithmic loafing can be induced through repeated encounters with correct decisions from the AI and transparency may combat it. As a form of transparency, explanation is offered for reasons that include justification, control, and discovery. However, algorithmic loafing is further reinforced by the perceived competence that an explanation provides. In this work, we explored these ideas via human subject experiments (n = 239). We also study how improving decision transparency through validation by an external human approver affects performance. Using eight experimental conditions in a high-stakes criminal justice context, we find that decision accuracy is typically unaffected by multiple forms of transparency but there is a significant difference in performance when the machine errs. Participants who saw explanations alone are better at overriding incorrect decisions; however, those under induced algorithmic loafing exhibit poor performance with variation in decision time. We conclude with recommendations on curtailing algorithmic loafing and achieving social facilitation, where task visibility motivates individuals to perform better.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing field of research that attracts significant funding from both the state and industry players. Such interest is driven by a wide range of AI technology applications in many fields. Since many AI research topics relate to computer science, where a significant share of research results are published in conference proceedings, the same applies to AI. The world leaders in artificial intelligence research are China and the United States. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the bibliometric indicators of AI conference papers from these two countries based on Scopus data. The analysis aimed to identify conferences that receive above-average citation rates and suggest publication strategies for authors from these countries to participate in conferences that are likely to provide better dissemination of their research results. The results showed that, although Chinese researchers publish more AI papers than those from the United States, US conference papers are cited more frequently. The authors also conducted a correlation analysis of the MNCS index, which revealed no high correlation between MNCS USA vs. MNCS China, MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. MSAR, and MNCS China/MNCS USA vs. CORE ranking indicators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper introduces Elegans-AI models, a class of neural networks that leverage the connectome topology of the Caenorhabditis elegans to design deep and reservoir architectures. Utilizing deep learning models inspired by the connectome, this paper leverages the evolutionary selection process to consolidate the functional arrangement of biological neurons within their networks. The initial goal involves the conversion of natural connectomes into artificial representations. The second objective centers on embedding the complex circuitry topology of artificial connectomes into both deep learning and deep reservoir networks, highlighting their neural-dynamic short-term and long-term memory and learning capabilities. Lastly, our third objective aims to establish structural explainability by examining the heterophilic/homophilic properties within the connectome and their impact on learning capabilities. In our study, the Elegans-AI models demonstrate superior performance compared to similar models that utilize either randomly rewired artificial connectomes or simulated bio-plausible ones. Notably, these Elegans-AI models achieve a top-1 accuracy of 99.99% on both Cifar10 and Cifar100, and 99.84% on MNIST Unsup. They do this with significantly fewer learning parameters, particularly when reservoir configurations of the connectome are used. Our findings indicate a clear connection between bio-plausible network patterns, the small-world characteristic, and learning outcomes, emphasizing the significant role of evolutionary optimization in shaping the topology of artificial neural networks for improved learning performance.",

Despite their widespread adoption, users voice concerns regarding privacy, security and trust in these systems. However, the composition of these perceptions, their impact on technology adoption and usage and the relationship between privacy, security and trust perceptions in the CAI context remain open research challenges. This study contributes to the field by conducting a Systematic Literature Review and offers insights into the current state of research on privacy, security and trust perceptions in the context of CAI systems. The review covers application fields and user groups and sheds light on empirical methods and tools used for assessment. Moreover, it provides insights into the reliability and validity of privacy, security and trust scales, as well as extensively investigating the subconstructs of each item as well as additional concepts which are concurrently collected. We point out that the perceptions of trust, privacy and security overlap based on the subconstructs we identified. While the majority of studies investigate one of these concepts, only a few studies were found exploring privacy, security and trust perceptions jointly. Our research aims to inform on directions to develop and use reliable scales for usersâ privacy, security and trust perceptions and contribute to the development of trustworthy CAI systems.",

As in other areas of emerging digitalization, applications and commercialization in this convergent technology domain raise multiple societal, ethical, and sustainability questions. Through interviews with various stakeholders involved in the AI-EB innovation ecosystem, we explore the extent to which these innovation intermediaries, as pivotal actors in innovation ecosystem development, are embedding attention to societal and sustainability objectives and concerns as well as facilitating economic goals. Notwithstanding available frameworks for responsible innovation that encourage attention to societal and sustainability implications, we find that innovation intermediaries in the engineering biology domain continue to emphasize conventional scale-up and commercialization approaches. Insights for intermediary development, research management, and policy are explored.",

Specifically, this study explored how factors such as gender and achievement levels have an impact on student attitudes. The development of the rule-based chatbot adhered to the network-based instructional systems design framework, which involves the application of the analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate model to the e-learning design and development process. The participants were 192 sixth-grade students, with 81 in the experimental group and 111 in the control group. The results revealed a positive effect on studentsâ science achievement and interest, with a particularly significant impact on those with lower achievement levels. Notably, the chatbot played a crucial role in elevating the interest of female students in science. These findings highlight the need for continued research into the integration of rule-based AI chatbots in science education.",

AI is increasingly being used to automate, optimize and personalize various aspects of the pharmacy industry, from drug discovery to drug dispensing. In this context, this paper explores the potential of AI to revolutionize the pharmacy industry, by discussing the current and future applications of AI in the industry. We will examine how AI is being used in drug discovery, personalized medicine, drug safety and quality control, inventory management, and patient counselling. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of AI in the pharmacy industry, such as data privacy, ethical concerns and regulatory barriers. The paper will argue that AI has the potential to revolutionize the pharmacy industry by enabling faster drug discovery, improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and increasing the efficiency and accuracy of various pharmacy operations. The old pharmacy system relied on manual processes and human decision-making, while the new AI pharmacy system automates routine tasks, provides personalized treatment plans, and reduces costs while improving patient outcomes. However, it is important to ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly, and that its impact on the workforce and society is carefully considered. The major benefit of integrating AI into specific applications within the pharmacy field is improved accuracy and efficiency in patient care. Overall, this paper will provide an insight into the future of the pharmacy industry, and the transformative potential of AI in this field.",

Recent publications demonstrated that they are able to outperform participants in written medical exams.\nResearch question\nWe aimed to explore the accuracy of AI in the written part of the EANS board exam.\nMaterial and methods\nEighty-six representative single best answer (SBA) questions, included at least ten times in prior EANS board exams, were selected by the current EANS board exam committee. The questionsâ content was classified as 75 text-based (TB) and 11 image-based (IB) and their structure as 50 interpretation-weighted, 30 theory-based and 6 true-or-false. Questions were tested with Chat GPT 3.5, Bing and Bard. The AI and participant results were statistically analyzed through ANOVA tests with Stata SE 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). P-values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.\nResults\nThe Bard LLM achieved the highest accuracy with 62% correct questions overall and 69% excluding IB, outperforming human exam participants 59% (p = 0.67) and 59% (p = 0.42), respectively. All LLMs scored highest in theory-based questions, excluding IB questions (Chat-GPT: 79%; Bing: 83%; Bard: 86%) and significantly better than the human exam participants (60%; p = 0.03). AI could not answer any IB question correctly.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nAI passed the written EANS board exam based on representative SBA questions and achieved results close to or even better than the human exam participants. Our results raise several ethical and practical implications, which may impact the current concept for the written EANS board exam.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, we have seen an impressive expansion of a family of Artificial intelligence models, known as generative AI, that are capable of producing fresh, unique material, including text, images, audio, and even code. Large datasets of previously published information are used to train these models, enabling them to mimic the patterns and structures of the data and produce original output that is stylistically and qualitatively comparable to the training set. While these models have many promising applications, they also carry significant risks and potential dangers that must be carefully considered, such as misinformation, intellectual property violations, or biased information. For these reasons, in this work, we have proposed a method to detect whether a sentence is human-generated or AI-generated. To achieve this goal, we used a labeled dataset to train four different models from the BERT family, achieving an Accuracy of 96%.",

    "abstract": "Technology has a major impact on the way nurses work. Data-driven technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have particularly strong potential to support nurses in their work. However, their use also introduces ambiguities. An example of such a technology is AI-driven lifestyle monitoring in long-term care for older adults, based on data collected from ambient sensors in an older adultâs home. Designing and implementing this technology in such an intimate setting requires collaboration with nurses experienced in long-term and older adult care. This viewpoint paper emphasizes the need to incorporate nurses and the nursing perspective into every stage of designing, using, and implementing AI-driven lifestyle monitoring in long-term care settings. It is argued that the technology will not replace nurses, but rather act as a new digital colleague, complementing the humane qualities of nurses and seamlessly integrating into nursing workflows. Several advantages of such a collaboration between nurses and technology are highlighted, as are potential risks such as decreased patient empowerment, depersonalization, lack of transparency, and loss of human contact. Finally, practical suggestions are offered to move forward with integrating the digital colleague.",

    "abstract": "Neurological disorders are the leading cause of physical and cognitive disability across the globe, currently affecting up to 15% of the world population, with the burden of chronic neurodegenerative diseases having doubled over the last 2 decades. Two decades ago, neurologists relying solely on clinical signs and basic imaging faced challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Today, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatic methods is changing this landscape. This paper explores this transformative journey, emphasizing the critical role of AI in neurology, aiming to integrate a multitude of methods and thereby enhance the field of neurology. Over the past 25 years, integrating biomedical data science into medicine, particularly neurology, has fundamentally transformed how we understand, diagnose, and treat neurological diseases. Advances in genomics sequencing, the introduction of new imaging methods, the discovery of novel molecular biomarkers for nervous system function, a comprehensive understanding of immunology and neuroimmunology shaping disease subtypes, and the advent of advanced electrophysiological recording methods, alongside the digitalization of medical records and the rise of AI, all led to an unparalleled surge in data within neurology. In addition, telemedicine and web-based interactive health platforms, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have become integral to neurology practice. The real-world impact of these advancements is evident, with AI-driven analysis of imaging and genetic data leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and more. Neuroinformatics is the key component connecting all these advances. By harnessing the power of IT and computational methods to efficiently organize, analyze, and interpret vast datasets, we can extract meaningful insights from complex neurological data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricate workings of the brain. In this paper, we describe the large-scale datasets that have emerged in neurology over the last 25 years and showcase the major advancements made by integrating these datasets with advanced neuroinformatic approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. We further discuss challenges in integrating AI into neurology, including ethical considerations in data use, the need for further personalization of treatment, and embracing new emerging technologies like quantum computing. These developments are shaping a future where neurological care is more precise, accessible, and tailored to individual patient needs. We believe further advancements in AI will bridge traditional medical disciplines and cutting-edge technology, navigating the complexities of neurological data and steering medicine toward a future of more precise, accessible, and patient-centric health care.",

Our study presents a computational design workflow that employs a generative AI from Polaron to rapidly predict optimal manufacturing parameters for battery electrodes. After training a generative model on a small dataset of two-dimensional (2D) microstructural images, we can efficiently generate representative microstructures for new parameters, enabling us to integrate this capability into a Bayesian optimization loop. This allows for the identification of optimal manufacturing conditions that enhance performance, such as energy density.\nImproved battery performance can accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage systems, contributing to reduced carbon emissions and a sustainable energy future. Our frameworkâs modularity also makes it applicable to a broad range of advanced materials, potentially transforming how industries approach material design and manufacturing.\nSummary\nLithium-ion batteries are used across various applications, necessitating tailored cell designs to enhance performance. Optimizing electrode manufacturing parameters is a key route to achieving this, as these parameters directly influence the microstructure and performance of the cells. However, linking process parameters to performance is complex, and experimental or modeling campaigns are often slow and expensive. This study introduces a fast computational optimization framework for electrode manufacturing parameters. A generative model, trained on a small dataset of microstructural images associated with different manufacturing parameters, efficiently generates representative microstructures for new parameters. This model is integrated into a Bayesian optimization loop that includes microstructure generation, characterization, and simulation, aiming to find optimal manufacturing parameters for a particular application. Significant improvement in the energy density of a 4680 cell is achieved through bespoke cell design, highlighting the importance of cell-scale normalization. The frameworkâs modularity allows its application to various advanced materials manufacturing scenarios.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (246KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research examines whether and why disclosing information to AI as opposed to humans influences an important brand-related outcomeâconsumersâ trust in brands. Results from two pilot studies and nine controlled experiments (n = 2,887) show that consumers trust brands less when they disclose information to AI as opposed to humans. The effect is driven by consumersâ inference that AI shares information with a larger audience, which increases consumersâ sense of exploitation. This, in turn, decreases their trust in brands. In line with our theorizing, the effect is stronger among consumers who are relatively more concerned about the privacy of their data. Furthermore, the negative consequences for brands can be mitigated when (1) customers are informed that the confidentiality of their information is protected, (2) AI is anthropomorphized, and (3) the disclosed information is relatively less relevant.",

It can have profound effects on both mental and physical health such as anxiety and depression. Thus, managing stress levels in mental healthcare is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. In this work, we introduce SereniSens, a multimodal AI framework with conversational agent integration to predict stress levels during sleep using physiological data. We evaluated the performance of four machine learning models - Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, and XGBoost - on the SaYoPillow dataset containing physiological signals recorded during sleep. Our models achieve high accuracy in predicting fve stress levels, with SVM obtaining 99.37% accuracy, outperforming previous implementations. We also propose an architecture integrating these predictive models with a Large Language Model to create a context-aware chatbot for stress monitoring and management. This framework demonstrates the potential of AI in mental healthcare, particularly for personalized stress assessment and intervention.",

In our confirmatory study, by analyzing 372 responses from users, using structural equation modelling (SEM), we initially validate our path model. Subsequently, we used fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to check the causal combinations to explain different trust levels. Apart from perceived regret avoidance, all of the other factors had a significant effect on attitude and trust. Perceived anthropomorphism moderated the associations between interaction quality, credibility, threat, and attitude.",

To examine whether these supposed benefits of AI are perceived as such, we have investigated the preferences of individuals, particularly women, for an AI-based evaluation process in a competitive situation. The results of our experimental study (N = 152) show that individuals generally prefer a human evaluator over an AI evaluatorâbut only if the human evaluator is female. Whereas we demonstrate that women's beliefs in AI to reduce bias and perceived personal discrimination have a positive direct effect, we find no direct effect of the competitors' gender on women's preference for an AI evaluation. However, we find that the belief in AI moderates the other two relationships, which highlights the crucial role of people's general perception of AI tools in realizing AI's full potential and reduce anticipated biases. Our findings provide an initial indication that the use of AI technology in hiring could encourage women to apply for jobs in male-dominated fields and serve as a starting point for future research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis meta-analysis examines the efficacy of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in second language acquisition within self-directed, out-of-classroom informal contexts. A total of 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified that examined the impact of GenAI on second-language proficiency, motivation, and self-regulation. GenAI was shown to have significant effects on English proficiency and self-regulation, demonstrating its versatility in enhancing language learning outcomes. However, GenAI failed to show significant effects on learning motivation, and based on this finding we highlight the need to develop measures of motivation that are suitable for GenAI in education. Possible ways to apply GenAI in the informal language learning environment are also discussed based on the included literature.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nAI models have shown promise in performing many medical imaging tasks. However, our ability to explain what signals these models have learned is severely lacking. Explanations are needed in order to increase the trust of doctors in AI-based models, especially in domains where AI prediction capabilities surpass those of humans. Moreover, such explanations could enable novel scientific discovery by uncovering signals in the data that arenât yet known to experts.\nMethods\nIn this paper, we present a workflow for generating hypotheses to understand which visual signals in images are correlated with a classification modelâs predictions for a given task. This approach leverages an automatic visual explanation algorithm followed by interdisciplinary expert review. We propose the following 4 steps: (i) Train a classifier to perform a given task to assess whether the imagery indeed contains signals relevant to the task; (ii) Train a StyleGAN-based image generator with an architecture that enables guidance by the classifier (âStylExâ); (iii) Automatically detect, extract, and visualize the top visual attributes that the classifier is sensitive towards. For visualization, we independently modify each of these attributes to generate counterfactual visualizations for a set of images (i.e., what the image would look like with the attribute increased or decreased); (iv) Formulate hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms, to stimulate future research. Specifically, present the discovered attributes and corresponding counterfactual visualizations to an interdisciplinary panel of experts so that hypotheses can account for social and structural determinants of health (e.g., whether the attributes correspond to known patho-physiological or socio-cultural phenomena, or could be novel discoveries).\nFindings\nTo demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach, we present results on eight prediction tasks across three medical imaging modalitiesâretinal fundus photographs, external eye photographs, and chest radiographs. We showcase examples where many of the automatically-learned attributes clearly capture clinically known features (e.g., types of cataract, enlarged heart), and demonstrate automatically-learned confounders that arise from factors beyond physiological mechanisms (e.g., chest X-ray underexposure is correlated with the classifier predicting abnormality, and eye makeup is correlated with the classifier predicting low hemoglobin levels). We further show that our method reveals a number of physiologically plausible, previously-unknown attributes based on the literature (e.g., differences in the fundus associated with self-reported sex, which were previously unknown).\nInterpretation\nOur approach enables hypotheses generation via attribute visualizations and has the potential to enable researchers to better understand, improve their assessment, and extract new knowledge from AI-based models, as well as debug and design better datasets. Though not designed to infer causality, importantly, we highlight that attributes generated by our framework can capture phenomena beyond physiology or pathophysiology, reflecting the real world nature of healthcare delivery and socio-cultural factors, and hence interdisciplinary perspectives are critical in these investigations. Finally, we will release code to help researchers train their own StylEx models and analyze their predictive tasks of interest, and use the methodology presented in this paper for responsible interpretation of the revealed attributes.\nFunding\nGoogle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe transformation of social development modes has led to profound changes in the pattern of intangible cultural heritage, while simultaneously posing significant challenges to its preservation. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought new development opportunities in various research fields. This study intends, by constructing and evaluating a theoretical model, to investigate whether AI-generated cultural and creative products can promote the sustainability of intangible cultural heritage. The central focus of this research is to measure the effectiveness of AI technologies in promoting the sustainability of intangible cultural heritage. The context of the research design is rooted in the attention, interest, search, action, and share (AISAS) model, incorporating theories of perceived value and cultural identity, to forecast the long-term viability of AI-generated cultural and creative products in the promotion of intangible cultural heritage. This research was conducted in Tianjin, China and carried out using quantitative methods, a questionnaire survey, and the accidental sampling method, taking a sample of 291 participants for analysis. The results show that 1) the attraction of and interest and participation in AI-generated Yangliuqing New Year Print cultural and creative products have a positive effect on perceived value; 2) the purchase and sharing of these products have a positive impact on cultural identity; 3) the perceived value has a positive impact on cultural identity; and 4) cultural identity has a positive impact on the sustainability of intangible cultural heritage. This study contributes to the theoretical development and practical application of the AISAS model and offers valuable insights into the future development trajectory of intangible cultural heritage, thereby promoting its sustainability. The limitations of this study are its small sample size and geographical restrictions. In future studies, the sample size will be expanded and will include more regions for data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCivil infrastructure inspection -and consequently maintenance- is carried out primarily through visual inspections. AI-enhanced (Artificial Intelligence) digital inspection methods, integrated with risk-based probabilistic approaches, have been promoted to keep existing structures, especially infrastructures, safe and predictable. Drones are used to obtain a significant number of images to cover the surface of a bridge, which are further integrated into a digital 3D (three-dimensional) model. According to the IFC standards (Industry Foundation Class), this 3D model is GPS-positioned (Global Positioning System) and connected to BIM (Building Information Modelling). Post-processing the accumulated data volume of all digital images is very time-consuming. For this reason, appropriate AI-based algorithms streamline this process significantly, enabling partially automated damage detection and assessment. To this end, images of various types of damage on different bridges are used to train and test the AI-enhanced models. In addition, damage identification and classification are developed. Six visually detectable defects can be identified, and theoretical models estimate the associated structural diseases. Finally, a probability-based risk assessment presents the basis for defining the criticality of the structure. With the help of digital images, it is possible to create a high-fidelity digital model and quantitative surface and spatial data records of the structural health condition of bridges and other infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated faces that are identical to actual ones is both a technological innovation and a major concern. While considering the implications, some of the existing security systems are unable to differentiate between a high-quality deep-fake and an actual intruder's face. For instance, the risks are quite high at an airport security checkpoint, where facial recognition is the first line of security against unauthorized entry. The primary concern here is how trustworthy the computer programs and algorithms will be in recognizing counterfeits among a plethora of actual and artificially generated faces. This necessitates the need to introduce machine learning approaches to differentiate between actual and fraudulent faces, particularly when AI-generated faces are involved. Effective artificial intelligence systems must be adaptive and change quickly in the face of more complex threats rather than simply recognizing them. AI-generated faces are becoming more convincing by the day, increasing the risk of their exploitation. This poses the need to ensure that the technology on which people rely should be robust and trustworthy in critical situations, whether it is a security checkpoint or an e-commerce site. In this perspective, this study has attempted to develop and implement Artificial Intelligence-powered solutions to detect the artificial faces while ensuring reliability for critical functions in an age where reality constantly blends with fiction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFetal ultrasound images are widely used for visualizing fetal development during pregnancy. These ultrasound image planes provide information about the anatomy of the fetus, thus helping healthcare professionals identify any abnormalities. Several AI tools are now being applied to classify fetal planes automatically. Accurate classification of fetal ultrasound image planes is crucial for the correct prenatal diagnosis and healthcare. However, while deep learning models have shown promise in image classifications, their âblack boxâ nature makes their decisions challenging to interpret, which is a significant concern in healthcare analytics. This paper addresses the problem of interpretability of the decisions made by a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for fetal ultrasound image classification using an XAI technique. Despite their accuracy, the established solutions lack the transparency essential for medical professionals to trust the model's predictions. The LIME(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is applied to interpret the CNN classification that provides a high classification accuracy. The results of LIME interpretability model on the top of CNN highlight the critical regions that positively and negatively contribute to the classification decision. This approach offers a transparent and trusted solution for leveraging AI in prenatal diagnostics.",

This study employed sequential explanatory design and conducted multiple in-depth interviews from two public universities of Indonesia to analyze the perception of students, teachers, and staff regarding the usage of ChatGPT. The study concludes that ChatGPT has substantial promise in revolutionizing higher education by offering an array of invaluable contributions. Teachers and students use it for different purposes, including research, exam preparation, and knowing future predictions about certain issues. The adaptation of ChatGPT generates personalized as well as tailored learning styles, which may generate explanations and create preferences for material and diverse information. On one hand, the usage of ChatGPT is considered either cheating or plagiarism while on the other hand, it is gained importance with regard to higher education and learning perspectives. The study also recommends that the Higher Education Commission (Dikti) needs to introduce the principles and regulations for AI usage in universities.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nThis manuscript contributes to the literature on AI-Augmented HRM (HRM(AI)).\nâ¢\nThis paper highlights the importance of HRM(AI) on organisational outcomes.\nâ¢\nThis paper analyses the context and the theoretical content of HRM(AI) research.\nâ¢\nBuilds a multilevel framework for future research.\nAbstract\nThe research using artificial intelligence (AI) applications in HRM functional areas has gained much traction and a steep surge over the last three years. The extant literature observes that contemporary AI applications have augmented HR functionalities. AI-Augmented HRM HRM(AI) has assumed strategic importance for achieving HRM domain-level outcomes and organisational outcomes for a sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, there is increasing evidence of literature reviews pertaining to the use of AI applications in different management disciplines (i.e., marketing, supply chain, accounting, hospitality, and education). There is a considerable gap in existing studies regarding a focused, systematic literature review on HRM(AI), specifically for a multilevel framework that can offer research scholars a platform to conduct potential future research. To address this gap, the authors present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 56 articles published in 35 peer-reviewed academic journals from October 1990 to December 2021. The purpose is to analyse the context (i.e., chronological distribution, geographic spread, sector-wise distribution, theories, and methods used) and the theoretical content (key themes) of HRM(AI) research and identify gaps to present a robust multilevel framework for future research. Based upon this SLR, the authors identify noticeable research gaps, mainly stemming from - unequal distribution of previous HRM(AI) research in terms of the smaller number of sector/country-specific studies, absence of sound theoretical base/frameworks, more research on routine HR functions(i.e. recruitment and selection) and significantly less empirical research. We also found minimal research evidence that links HRM(AI) and organisational-level outcomes. To overcome this gap, we propose a multilevel framework that offers a platform for future researchers to draw linkage among diverse variables starting from the contextual level to HRM and organisational level outcomes that eventually enhance operational and financial organisational performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn November 2022, ChatGPT marked a transformative moment in artificial intelligence, leveraging generative AI tools (GAI) and large language models (LLMs) to mimic human language effectively. Their rapidly gained popularity has reshaped a number of areas, presenting both challenges and opportunities. With their widespread adoption, concerns arise regarding the reliability of information generated by these tools, particularly in detecting fake news and addressing hallucinations. This study, conducted within the OpenFact project, involves an experiment with students tasked to generate and critically assess text produced by GAI tools. Results indicate a common occurrence of hallucinations in LLM outputs and a lack of transparency in information sources, posing challenges for practical applications. Furthermore, participants demonstrate the ease of manipulating GAI tools to generate false information, underscoring the risk associated with their widespread use. These findings contribute to understanding the limitations and implications of utilizing GAI tools in information verification processes and highlight the need for further research in this area.",

Malignant and benign tumours were determined by biopsies using histological analysis and follow-up within 24 months. The radiomics and deep learning methods were employed to extract the breast mass features in images and finally for benign and malignant classification. The DM, DBT and DM combined DBT (DM + DBT) images were fed into radiomics and deep learning models to construct corresponding models, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was employed to estimate model performance. An external dataset of 146 patients from March 2021 to December 2022 from another center was enrolled for external validation.\nResults\nIn the internal testing dataset, compared with the DM model and the DBT model, the DM + DBT models based on radiomics and deep learning both showed statistically significant higher AUCs [0.810 (RA-DM), 0.823 (RA-DBT) and 0.869 (RA-DM + DBT), P â¤ 0.001; 0.867 (DL-DM), 0.871 (DL-DBT) and 0.908 (DL-DM + DBT), P = 0.001]. The deep learning models present superior to the radiomics models in the experiments with only DM (0.867 vs 0.810, P = 0.001), only DBT (0.871 vs 0.823, P = 0.001) and DM + DBT (0.908 vs 0.869, P = 0.003).\nConclusions\nDBT has a clear additional value for diagnosing breast mass less than 2 cm compared with only DM. AI-based methods, especially deep learning, can help achieve excellent performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLow Back Pain (LBP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder affecting over 80% of the population over their lifetime and is a leading cause of disability globally. The most frequent type, non-specific LBP (NSLBP) does not have a clearly identifiable pathology cause. Current clinical guidelines advocate for tailored management and self-care approaches for NSLBP. The effectiveness of these personalised management plans significantly depends on accurate and on-going assessment of the patientâs spinal function. This presents considerable challenges for both clinicians and patients.\nThis study introduces âSpineSighterâ, an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed to tailor management of NSLBP by categorising patients based on their spinal function either into High Function (HF) and Low Function (LF) subsets. Utilising standard video recordings and computer vision technology, SpineSighter analyses motion features such as angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration during repeated forward flexion tests. The model showed high accuracy in classifying spinal function, achieving an accuracy of 95.13%, sensitivity of 93.81%, specificity of 96.00%, and an F1 score of 0.9442. This innovative use of AI highlights the importance of velocity as a critical indicator of spinal functional differences, opening new avenues for personalised clinical management, self-care and recovery strategies of NSLBP.",

The emphasis falls on users' foci of attention as they perform linguistic tests on ChatGPT and on how the âmetaâ practices manifest themselves interactionally on the selected subreddit, where human-AI interactions are showcased for entertainment purposes. The findings suggest that engaging with AI reflects and, potentially, enhances language users' metalinguistic, metadiscursive, metacommunicative and metapragmatic awareness. This awareness is mirrored in ChatGPT's output, indicative of its previous human-assisted training. Additionally, this investigation demonstrates that, when acknowledged as one subject of study, the four âmetaâ concepts are intricately intertwined as they may co-occur and overlap.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nImage-derived artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models for breast cancer have shown high discriminatory performances compared with clinical risk models based on family history and lifestyle factors. However, little is known about their generalizability across European screening settings. We therefore investigated the discriminatory performances of an AI-based risk model in European screening settings.\nMethods\nUsing four European screening populations in three countries (Italy, Spain, Germany) screened between 2009 and 2020 for women aged 45â69, we performed a nested case-control study to assess the predictive performance of an AI-based risk model. In total, 739 women with incident breast cancers were included together with 7812 controls matched on year of study-entry. Mammographic features (density, microcalcifications, masses, left-right breast asymmetries of these features) were extracted using AI from negative digital mammograms at study-entry. Two-year absolute risks of breast cancer were predicted and assessed after two years of follow-up. Adjusted risk stratification performance metrics were reported per clinical guidelines.\nFindings\nThe overall adjusted Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (aAUC) of the AI risk model was 0.72 (95% CI 0.70â0.75) for breast cancers developed in four screening populations. In the 6.2% [529/8551] of women at high risk using the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines thresholds, cancers were more likely diagnosed after 2 years follow-up, risk-ratio (RR) 6.7 (95% CI 5.6â8.0), compared with the 69% [5907/8551] of women classified at general risk by the model. Similar risk-ratios were observed across levels of mammographic density.\nInterpretation\nThe AI risk model showed generalizable discriminatory performances across European populations and, predicted â¼30% of clinically relevant stage 2 and higher breast cancers in â¼6% of high-risk women who were sent home with a negative mammogram. Similar results were seen in women with fatty and dense breasts.\nFunding\nSwedish Research Council.",

Members have accumulated rich experiences dealing with typhoons' negative impact and developed the technologies and measures on typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning in various ways to reduce the damage caused by typhoon. However, it is still facing many difficulties and challenges to accurately forecast the occurrence of typhoons and warning the potential impacts in an early stage due to the continuously changing weather conditions. With the development of information technology (IT) and computing science, and increasing accumulated hydro-meteorological data in recent decades, scientists, researchers and operationers keep trying to improve forecasting models based on the application of big data and artificial intelligent (AI) technology to promote the capacity of typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning. This paper reviewed the current status of application of big data and AI technology in the aspect of typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning, and discussed the challenges and limitations that must be addressed to effectively harness the power of big data and AI technology application in typhoon-related disaster risk reduction in the future.",

For example, the inability to predict the malfunctioning of AI impedes timely human intervention. In this paper, we employ a computerized navigation task, namely, a game called lunar lander, to investigate empirically how AI's predictability compares to humans' predictability. We ask participants to guess whether the landings of a spaceship performed by AI and humans will succeed. We show that humans are worse at predicting AI performance than at predicting human performance in this environment. Significantly, participants underestimate the differences in the relative predictability of AI and, at times, overestimate their prediction skills. These results raise doubts about the human ability to exercise control of AI effectively â at least in certain contexts.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nPredicting dementia early has major implications for clinical management and patient outcomes. Yet, we still lack sensitive tools for stratifying patients early, resulting in patients being undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed. Despite rapid expansion in machine learning models for dementia prediction, limited model interpretability and generalizability impede translation to the clinic.\nMethods\nWe build a robust and interpretable predictive prognostic model (PPM) and validate its clinical utility using real-world, routinely-collected, non-invasive, and low-cost (cognitive tests, structural MRI) patient data. To enhance scalability and generalizability to the clinic, we: 1) train the PPM with clinically-relevant predictors (cognitive tests, grey matter atrophy) that are common across research and clinical cohorts, 2) test PPM predictions with independent multicenter real-world data from memory clinics across countries (UK, Singapore).\nFindings\nPPM robustly predicts (accuracy: 81.66%, AUC: 0.84, sensitivity: 82.38%, specificity: 80.94%) whether patients at early disease stages (MCI) will remain stable or progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). PPM generalizes from research to real-world patient data across memory clinics and its predictions are validated against longitudinal clinical outcomes. PPM allows us to derive an individualized AI-guided multimodal marker (i.e. predictive prognostic index) that predicts progression to AD more precisely than standard clinical markers (grey matter atrophy, cognitive scores; PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio = 3.42, p = 0.01) or clinical diagnosis (PPM-derived marker: hazard ratio = 2.84, p < 0.01), reducing misdiagnosis.\nInterpretation\nOur results provide evidence for a robust and explainable clinical AI-guided marker for early dementia prediction that is validated against longitudinal, multicenter patient data across countries, and has strong potential for adoption in clinical practice.\nFunding\nWellcome Trust, Royal Society, Alzheimerâs Research UK, Alzheimerâs Drug Discovery Foundation Diagnostics Accelerator, Alan Turing Institute.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nOutdoor pipeline leaks are difficult to accurately measure using existing concentration measurement systems installed in petrochemical plants owing to external air currents. Besides, leak detection is only possible for a specific gas. The purpose of this study was to develop an image/ultrasonic convergence camera system that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) to improve pipe leak detection and establish a real-time monitoring system. Our system includes an advanced ultrasonic camera coupled with a deep learning-based object-detection algorithm trained on pipe image data from petrochemical plants. The collected data improved the accuracy of detected gas leak localization through deep learning. Our detection model achieves an mAP50 (Mean average precision calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50)score of 0.45 on our data and is able to detect the majority of leak points within a system. The petrochemical plant environment was simulated by visiting petrochemical plants and reviewing drawings, and an outdoor experimental demonstration site was established. Scenarios such as flange connection failure were set under medium-/low-pressure conditions, and the developed product was experimented under gas leak conditions that simulated leakage accidents. These experiments enabled the removal of potentially confounding surrounding noise sources, which led to the false detection of actual gas leaks using the AI piping detection technique.",

Prioritizing vulnerable groups and regions is key for SDG2 'Zero Hunger' success.\nAbstract\nGlobalization and interconnected supply chains have led to complex disruptions in global value chains, caused by various factors such as natural disasters, climate events, geopolitical conflicts, and economic crises. Recent breakthroughs in AI, machine learning, blockchain, and big data analytics offer new possibilities for forecasting and managing these disruptions effectively. This study examines the role of AI in forecasting and managing disruptions within global value chain to tackle food insecurity. We conducted a bibliometric and scientometric analysis using comprehensive data from Scopus and Web of Science to explore emerging research trends, influential publications, leading institutions, collaborations, themes, policy implications, and future research avenues. The research revealed an average yearly growth rate of 13.78 % in publications from 1973 to 2022. China, the United Kingdom, and the United States lead in AI applications to address supply chain disruptions, particularly concerning food insecurity. Frequently used keywords include \"food security,\" \"supply chain management,\" \"agriculture,\" \"modelling,\" \"climate change,\" and \"COVID-19.\" Themes identified focus on the impact of COVID-19 on food supply chains, achieving food security amidst climate change, leveraging predictive models in agriculture, and assessing the impact of disruptions on food price volatility and global supply chain risk assessment approaches. The insights gained from this research offer valuable guidance for policymakers and researchers to enhance food security. The identified themes provide direction for future research efforts in advancing food security amidst uncertainties and disruptions in global value chains.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (567KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This paper examines whether researchers could apply ChatGPT to develop and empirically validate new research scales. The study describes a process how to prompt ChatGPT to assist the scale development of a new construct, using the example of the construct of perceived value of ChatGPT-supported consumer behavior. The paper reports four main empirical studies (US: N = 148; Australia: N = 317; UK: N = 108; Germany: N = 51) that have been employed to validate the newly developed scale. The first study purifies the scale. The following studies confirm the adjusted factorial validity of the reduced scale. Although the empirical data imply a simplification of the initial multi-dimensional scale, the final three-dimensional operationalization is highly reliable and valid.

However, the similarities between common skin disorders and mpox and the need for professional diagnosis unavoidably impaired the diagnosis of earlier-stage mpox patients and contributed to mpox outbreak. To address the challenge, we proposed âSuper Monitoringâ, a real-time visualization technique employing artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet technology to diagnose earlier-stage mpox cheaply, conveniently, and quickly. Concretely, AI-mediated âSuper Monitoringâ (mpox-AISM) integrates deep learning models, data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and cloud services. According to publicly accessible datasets, mpox-AISMâs Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1-score in diagnosing mpox reach 99.3%, 94.1%, 99.9%, and 96.6%, respectively, and it achieves 94.51% accuracy in diagnosing mpox, six like-mpox skin disorders, and normal skin. With the Internet and communication terminal, mpox-AISM has the potential to perform real-time and accurate diagnosis for earlier-stage mpox in real-world scenarios, thereby preventing mpox outbreak.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (217KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is driving significant impact on businesses across many sectors. Specifically, generative AI (GenAI) is fueling new capabilities that have triggered a wave of innovation. For example, there has been massive hype surrounding the launch of ChatGPT, with growing speculation regarding its disruptive nature for organizations and society. The ongoing debate conveys a clear belief that ChatGPT will lead to far-reaching innovation. However, it is less clear whether such innovation can be managed. We seek to close this gap by identifying distinctive innovation strategies in terms of two key dimensions: automation and augmentation (high or low). We present a new typology of four generic innovation strategies: Traditional Tool (low automation, low augmentation), Basic Automation (high automation, low augmentation), Automated Assistance (low automation, high augmentation), and Assisted Augmentation (high automation, high augmentation). These strategies differ in relation to how we view automation and augmentation for innovation, and also the risks and challenges faced throughout the process and tactics for managing the process. The typology of four generic innovation strategies pinpoints how the four strategies essentially differ not only in relation to automation and augmentation for innovation but also in terms of risks and challenges faced in the process, as well as available tactics for managing the process. Building upon this framework, our insights suggest that practitioners can harness ChatGPT effectively by aligning their innovation objectives with the appropriate strategy, whether it be enhancing creative processes or streamlining operational efficiency, thereby navigating the complexities of innovation with a more structured and strategic approach.",

Highlighted by Batteries Europe as crucial for battery safety, advances in thermal monitoring are imperative to continuous safe adoption of battery technology. Deep Learning techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection (AD) in many thermal mapping applications. These data-driven methods can handle common challenges like data unavailability or environment variations. Our study devises a methodology to leverage Deep Learning with thermal data from commercially available pouch cells and an infrared camera. We explain the building blocks of FAUAD (Feature-Adapted Unsupervised Anomaly Detection), which models the normality of the input data and synthesizes anomalies in its feature space. The resulting model is benchmarked against some of the latest state-of-the-art methods and achieves high anomaly detection capability; Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) score of 0.971 on simulated data, 0.990 on contaminated real data, and a perfect score of 1.0 on real clean data. While maintaining a compact size of 15 MB. FAUAD offers a notable advancement in unsupervised anomaly detection for battery thermal monitoring. The proposed method is cell chemistry agnostic and open to usage scenarios beyond this worksâ scope.",

    "abstract": "Background\nOvercrowding of hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) is a growing problem. However, not all ED consultations are necessary. For example, 80% of patients in the ED with chest pain do not have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Artificial intelligence (AI) is useful in analyzing (medical) data, and might aid health care workers in prehospital clinical decision-making before patients are presented to the hospital.\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to develop an AI model which would be able to predict ACS before patients visit the ED. The model retrospectively analyzed prehospital data acquired by emergency medical services' nurse paramedics.\nMethods\nPatients presenting to the emergency medical services with symptoms suggestive of ACS between September 2018 and September 2020 were included. An AI model using a supervised text classification algorithm was developed to analyze data. Data were analyzed for all 7458 patients (mean 68, SD 15 years, 54% men). Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for control and intervention groups. At first, a machine learning (ML) algorithm (or model) was chosen; afterward, the features needed were selected and then the model was tested and improved using iterative evaluation and in a further step through hyperparameter tuning. Finally, a method was selected to explain the final AI model.\nResults\nThe AI model had a specificity of 11% and a sensitivity of 99.5% whereas usual care had a specificity of 1% and a sensitivity of 99.5%. The PPV of the AI model was 15% and the NPV was 99%. The PPV of usual care was 13% and the NPV was 94%.\nConclusions\nThe AI model was able to predict ACS based on retrospective data from the prehospital setting. It led to an increase in specificity (from 1% to 11%) and NPV (from 94% to 99%) when compared to usual care, with a similar sensitivity. Due to the retrospective nature of this study and the singular focus on ACS it should be seen as a proof-of-concept. Other (possibly life-threatening) diagnoses were not analyzed. Future prospective validation is necessary before implementation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the continuously advancing field of mechanical engineering, digitalization is bringing a major transformation, specifically with the concept of digital twins. Digital twins are dynamic digital models of real-world systems and processes, crucial for Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0, which are changing how humans and machines work together in manufacturing. This paper explores the combination of physics-based and data-driven modeling using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of mechanical systems, improving materials design and manufacturing processes. The focus is on the advanced 42SiCr alloy, where AI-driven digital twinning is used to optimize cooling rates during Quenching and Partitioning (Q-P) treatments. This leads to significant improvements in the mechanical properties of 42SiCr steel. Given its complex properties influenced by various factors, this alloy is perfect for digital twinning. The Q-P heat treatment process not only restores the material's deformability but also gives it advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) properties. The findings show how AI and ML can effectively guide the development of high-strength steels and enhance their treatment processes. Additionally, integrating digital twins with new technologies like the Metaverse offers exciting possibilities for simulated production, remote monitoring, and collaborative design. By establishing a clear workflow from physical to digital twins and presenting empirical results, this paper connects theoretical modeling with practical applications, paving the way for smarter manufacturing solutions in mechanical engineering. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how digital twins can be integrated into advanced technologies like the Metaverse, opening up new possibilities for simulated production, remote monitoring, design collaboration, training simulations, analytics, and complete supply chain visibility. This integration is a crucial step toward realizing the full potential of digitalization in mechanical engineering.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nComposer Ludwig van Beethoven died in 1827, leaving behind several dozen sketches for his Tenth Symphony. In 2021, a team of computer scientists and musicians trained an artificial neural network to create a realization of the third and fourth movements. Comparing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to the algorithmic Tenth reveals differences between human and computational creativity. In its speed and fecundity, the AI model captures some of the features of spontaneous human creativity. However, it is less equipped for deliberate creativity, which requires non-linear thinking, context-driven decision-making, elaborating unusual choices, and the capacity to revise. Implications for cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and education are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nThe following are the main contributions of the work presented in the manuscript.\nâ¢\nFormulation of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic management task in terms of a centralized Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) problem.\nâ¢\nDefinition of a powerful architecture of the Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management (UTM) system and conceptual design of all system components to carry out DCB using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based framework.\nâ¢\nInitial definition of several empirical factors to account for various environmental and operational aspects influencing demand and capacity in real-life operations.\nâ¢\nDevelopment and verification of an innovative AI-based solution to the DCB problem which adopts powerful metaheuristics (MA) and Machine Learning (ML) to determine and rapidly generate solutions to the DCB problem in a variety of instances.\nAbstract\nUrban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a promising solution to address some of the challenges of transportation congestion and associated pollution, especially in large cities. However, the development of drone transportation and UAM services is limited by the capacity of the low altitude airspace where these new vehicles will operate. Without suitable regulatory advancements and associated traffic management systems, air traffic in the densest low-altitude sectors may incur congestion, which, in addition to affecting operational efficiency, can increase systemic risk and fuel emergency occurrences, thereby affecting the safety of people and property in the air and on the ground. To address these challenges, this study aims to develop an intelligent Uncrewed Aircraft Traffic Management (UTM) system that leverages the complementary strengths of metaheuristic and machine learning algorithms for an effective management of dense low altitude airspace. The UTM system determines time-based three-dimensional airspace Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) solutions by processing real-time data updates and dynamically replanning flight paths and DCB decisions in any given context, while also providing UAM operators with relevant inputs for autonomous decision-making. Simulation-based verification activities in representative conditions show that the proposed UTM system has the ability to effectively resolve overload instances and minimize potential conflicts in low-altitude airspace, with an operationally acceptable running time. We conclude that the proposed hybrid algorithm can support a successful implementation of UAM services in and around cities, and it has high potential to address critical airspace resource constraints also in traditional Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM).",

To meet this need, we release a spiking neural network (SNN)-based, brain-inspired cognitive intelligence engine (BrainCog) that provides a variety of universal essential components, including spiking neurons, encoding strategies, learning rules, brain areas, and hardware-software co-design. With these easy-to-use components, BrainCog incorporates numerous brain-inspired AI models that cover five categories of brain-inspired cognitive functions. It also supports multi-scale brain structure and function simulation. We also provide BORN, an SNN-driven, brain-inspired AI engine that integrates multiple BrainCog components and cognitive functions to build advanced AI models and robotics applications.\nSummary\nSpiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as a promising computational framework for integrating insights from the brain into artificial intelligence (AI). Existing software infrastructures based on SNNs exclusively support brain simulation or brain-inspired AI, but not both simultaneously. To decode the nature of biological intelligence and create AI, we present the brain-inspired cognitive intelligence engine (BrainCog). This SNN-based platform provides essential infrastructure support for developing brain-inspired AI and brain simulation. BrainCog integrates different biological neurons, encoding strategies, learning rules, brain areas, and hardware-software co-design as essential components. Leveraging these user-friendly components, BrainCog incorporates various cognitive functions, including perception and learning, decision-making, knowledge representation and reasoning, motor control, social cognition, and brain structure and function simulations across multiple scales. BORN is an AI engine developed by BrainCog, showcasing seamless integration of BrainCogâs components and cognitive functions to build advanced AI models and applications.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (200KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies have advanced to the point where they can automate large parts of the hiring process and in consequence transform the role of recruiters or Human Resource professionals. However, there is little research on how recruiters perceive AI, and little is known about the motivations or factors that influence the use of AI in their workplaces. This study examined recruiters' intentions to use AI by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to include the frequency of AI use and education. Data were obtained from a web-based survey with 238 demographically balanced participants. Hierarchical regression analysis was applied for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results showed that behavioral intention was significantly and positively influenced by performance expectancy, and the moderating effect of frequency of AI use, while gender, age, experience, and education had no significant impact. Efficiency gains, time savings and automation emerged as the most important benefits, while lack of human judgment was the main disadvantage of AI use in recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe overcrowding of the emergency departments presents a major challenge, exacerbated by an aging population and increasing complex cases. Triage, which prioritizes patients according to severity, faces significant pressure due to limited resources and growing patient numbers. This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the triage process. We developed and evaluated AI-based models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Linear Regression (LR), XGBoost and a stacking model, to predict patient triage levels using the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS). Our findings demonstrate that AI models, particularly SVM and GBM, delivered the highest prediction accuracies of 79% and 78.7%, respectively. These models also performed well in terms of precision (80.04% and 75.36%), recall (71.94% and 73.36%), and F1-score (72.93% and 72.91%). The remaining algorithms still demonstrated strong predictive capabilities. The developed Stacking Model exhibited the highest prediction, achieving an accuracy of 80.05%, precision of 80.27%, recall of 73.26%, and an F1-score of 74.41%. This incremental gain in performance demonstrates the effectiveness of model stacking, as it capitalizes on the complementary strengths of different algorithms to enhance overall predictive accuracy.",

Current screening methods, such as mammography, face limitations, particularly for women under 50 due to radiation concerns and frequency of examination restrictions. MammoWave, utilizing microwave signals (1 to 9 GHz), emerges as an innovative and safe technology for breast cancer detection. This paper focuses on the numerical data extracted from MammoWave, presenting a hierarchical approach to address challenges posed by a diverse dataset of over 1000 samples from two European hospitals. The proposed approach involves unsupervised clustering to classify data into two main groups, followed by binary classification within each group to distinguish healthy and non-healthy cases. Careful consideration is given to feature extraction methods and classifiers at each step. The unique influence of sub-bands within the 1 to 9 GHz range on the diagnosis model is observed, leading to the selection of suitable sub-bands, feature extraction methods, and classification models. An optimization algorithm and a defined cost function are employed to achieve high and balanced sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values. Experimental results showcase a promising overall balanced performance of around 70 %, representing a significant milestone in breast cancer detection using microwave imaging. MammoWave, with its novel approach, provides a solution that overcomes age and frequency of examination related limitations associated with existing screening methods, contributing to enhanced breast health monitoring for a broader population.",

AR allows the creation of an entirely new and interactive experience for users. However, there are several drawbacks in developing AR applications, such as the marker identification process and the creation of content itself. These are very time-consuming procedures and require ad-hoc development. The advantages of using AI to solve AR limitations have recently been explored in literature. Motivated by these findings, in this paper it is proposed DeepReality, a software toolkit plug-in for Unity 3D. It is conceived for allowing developers to integrate any Deep Learning (DL) models into Unity, through AR Foundation and Barracuda inference engine. DeepReality is aimed at simplifying and streamlining the usage of DL models in conjunction with AR. As such, users skilled in Unity and DL can easily create mobile applications (iOS and Android) to: extract visual features of real-world objects (framed with the device camera) via DL; Show on-screen content on top of those real-world objects, via AR. DeepReality performs object semantic processing within the scene, and extended semantic effects for incongruent objects, overcoming the environmental tracking, which is feature-based. In order to test DeepReality usability, experiments have been performed on the execution time and memory usage data, demonstrating the feasibility and possibility of integrating and using DNNs models in mobile applications for AR. The complexity analysis confirms that DeepReality can be completely executed on mobile devices. DeepReality is also open-source and it is freely available in the Unity asset store. By fostering accessible AI-AR integration, DeepReality addresses key shortcomings in existing approaches, encapsulating contributions such as versatile DL integration, open-source accessibility, operational validation, and comprehensive metrics analysis. DeepReality empowers developers to transcend boundaries, enriching AR applications with AIâs transformative potential. Our proposed framework fosters benchmarking, comparison, and a future harmonised by AR-AI synergy.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (140KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The framework incorporates ethical considerations, context adaptability, and community collaboration.\nâ¢\nMulti-Dimensional Approach to Performance Assessment: The research addresses the complexity of evaluating AI systems like ChatGPT by designing task-specific benchmarks and evaluation metrics. This multi-dimensional approach assesses the AIâs performance across various conversational tasks, focusing on its understanding of context, coherence, and provision of relevant and accurate responses.\nâ¢\nPromoting Ethical Alignment in AI Systems: The paper discusses the importance of ethical alignment in conversational AI systems. It incorporates principles from frameworks like IEEEâs Ethically Aligned Design and the Montreal Declaration to address potential biases, protect user privacy, and encourage responsible data handling practices.\nâ¢\nAdvancing Evaluation Techniques and User-Centric Evaluation: The research explores advanced metrics and methodologies for evaluating the performance and capabilities of ChatGPT, including user feedback integration and reinforcement learning.\nAbstract\nConversational AI systems like ChatGPT have seen remarkable advancements in recent years, revolutionizing humanâcomputer interactions. However, evaluating the performance and ethical implications of these systems remains a challenge. This paper delves into the creation of rigorous benchmarks, adaptable standards, and an intelligent evaluation methodology tailored specifically for ChatGPT. We meticulously analyze several prominent benchmarks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, SQuAD, CoQA, Persona-Chat, DSTC, BIG-Bench, HELM and MMLU illuminating their strengths and limitations. This paper also scrutinizes the existing standards set by OpenAI, IEEEâs Ethically Aligned Design, the Montreal Declaration, and Partnership on AIâs Tenets, investigating their relevance to ChatGPT. Further, we propose adaptive standards that encapsulate ethical considerations, context adaptability, and community involvement. In terms of evaluation, we explore traditional methods like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, precisionârecall, F1 score, perplexity, and user feedback, while also proposing a novel evaluation approach that harnesses the power of reinforcement learning. Our proposed evaluation framework is multidimensional, incorporating task-specific, real-world application, and multi-turn dialogue benchmarks. We perform feasibility analysis, SWOT analysis and adaptability analysis of the proposed framework. The framework highlights the significance of user feedback, integrating it as a core component of evaluation alongside subjective assessments and interactive evaluation sessions. By amalgamating these elements, this paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive evaluation framework that fosters responsible and impactful advancement in the field of conversational AI.",

The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and studentsâ intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages. Limitations and future research opportunities are also outlined.",

We first discuss new methods of direct retrieval from SAR and geostationary imagers. Next, we survey some of the most prominent new techniques in AI and discuss their major capabilities (especially accuracy in nonlinear TC behavior, characterization of model uncertainty and creation of synthetic satellite imagery) and limitations (especially lack of transparency and limited amount of training data). We also identify concerns with biases and unlabeled uncertainties in the Best Track records as being a first-order limitation for further progress in objective methods. The article concludes with recommendations to improve future objective methods, especially in the area of more accurate and reliable training data sets.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAdverse events refer to incidents with potential or actual harm to patients in hospitals. These events are typically documented through patient safety event (PSE) reports, which consist of detailed narratives providing contextual information on the occurrences. Accurate classification of PSE reports is crucial for patient safety monitoring. However, this process faces challenges due to inconsistencies in classifications and the sheer volume of reports. Recent advancements in text representation, particularly contextual text representation derived from transformer-based language models, offer a promising solution for more precise PSE report classification. Integrating the machine learning (ML) classifier necessitates a balance between human expertise and artificial intelligence (AI). Central to this integration is the concept of explainability, which is crucial for building trust and ensuring effective human-AI collaboration.\nObjective\nThis study aims to investigate the efficacy of ML classifiers trained using contextual text representation in automatically classifying PSE reports. Furthermore, the study presents an interface that integrates the ML classifier with the explainability technique to facilitate human-AI collaboration for PSE report classification.\nMethods\nThis study used a data set of 861 PSE reports from a large academic hospitalâs maternity units in the Southeastern United States. Various ML classifiers were trained with both static and contextual text representations of PSE reports. The trained ML classifiers were evaluated with multiclass classification metrics and the confusion matrix. The local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) technique was used to provide the rationale for the ML classifierâs predictions. An interface that integrates the ML classifier with the LIME technique was designed for incident reporting systems.\nResults\nThe top-performing classifier using contextual representation was able to obtain an accuracy of 75.4% (95/126) compared to an accuracy of 66.7% (84/126) by the top-performing classifier trained using static text representation. A PSE reporting interface has been designed to facilitate human-AI collaboration in PSE report classification. In this design, the ML classifier recommends the top 2 most probable event types, along with the explanations for the prediction, enabling PSE reporters and patient safety analysts to choose the most suitable one. The LIME technique showed that the classifier occasionally relies on arbitrary words for classification, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight.\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates that training ML classifiers with contextual text representations can significantly enhance the accuracy of PSE report classification. The interface designed in this study lays the foundation for human-AI collaboration in the classification of PSE reports. The insights gained from this research enhance the decision-making process in PSE report classification, enabling hospitals to more efficiently identify potential risks and hazards and enabling patient safety analysts to take timely actions to prevent patient harm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs open innovation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) become more prevalent in financial institutions, early adoption of Chatbots will have a competitive advantage. However, ChatGPT is still less common in the financial sector than in other industries. This study attempts to understand bankers' perceptions towards using ChatGPT. Towards this, the study employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. Eventually, 10 bank professionals participated in the preliminary semi-structured interviews to gain insight into their perceptions. Sequentially, the study cross-sectionally examined the identified factors among 368 bankers to triangulate the framework with empirical evidence. The Thematic Content Analysis (TCA) analysis identified seven new factors related to bankers' use of ChatGPT, which were primarily validated in PLS-SEM assessments. The results showed the positive effect of performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, awareness, innovativeness, and system quality on ChatGPT usage and the negative effect of technology self-efficacy and IT features. Intriguingly, the moderating effects of central bank support were positively confirmed for innovativeness and social influence, but negative for the relationship between technology self-efficacy, awareness, and bankers' intention. This study offers a highly predictive model contemplating the applicability of an extended UTAUT model to explain the use of ChatGPT in the banking sector. Accordingly, we suggest that decision-makers should emphasize improving the individual attributes of their human capital towards technology and improving AI system quality, as well as working closely with government-powered authorities that would facilitate the diffusion process of AI Chatbots in the banking sector.",

This study aims to examine whether AI-based models can identify key operational processes of a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) facility and predict the emission of target air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and total suspended particles (TSP). First, key operational variables are selected based on the feature importance of the Random Forest models (that is, data-driven input selection). Secondly, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based AutoEncoder (BiLSTM-AE) and Random Forest (RF) models with the data-driven input selection are trained and evaluated using multiple predictive performance metrics. Then, the BiLSTM-AE and RF models are trained and evaluated using the operational variables selected by experts. Results demonstrate that the data-driven and expertise-based methods select five common operational variables that are key factors to predict variations of target output variables. The results from the multi-metric evaluations show a skillful prediction of BiLSTM-AE and RF models for NOx and TSP, but not SOx. For TSP prediction, RF is more sensitive to the input selection method than BiLSTM-AE. This study underscores the dependency of the prediction skill of AI algorithm-based models on the target air pollutant and input selection method, and suggests the trustworthiness of selected key operational variables by RF's feature importance.",

We embed recently released data on patents and publications related to AI in an augmented model of productivity growth, which we estimate for the OECD countries and compare to an extended sample including non-OECD countries. Our estimates provide evidence in favour of the modern productivity paradox. We show that the development of AI technologies remains a niche innovation phenomenon with a negligible role in the officially recorded productivity growth process. This general result, i.e. a lack of a strong relationship between AI and registered macroeconomic productivity growth, is robust to changes in the country sample, in the way we quantify labour productivity and technology (including AI stock), in the specification of the empirical model (control variables) and in estimation methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIncreasing reliance on large-scale AI models has led to rising demand for intelligent services. The centralized cloud computing approach has limitations in terms of data transfer efficiency and response time, and as a result many service providers have begun to deploy edge servers to cache intelligent services in order to reduce transmission delay and communication energy consumption. However, finding the optimal service caching strategy remains a significant challenge due to the stochastic nature of service requests and the bulky nature of intelligent services. To deal with this we propose a distributed service caching scheme integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with mobility prediction, which we refer to as DSDM. Specifically, we employ the D3QN (Deep Double Dueling Q-Network) framework to integrate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predicted mobile device locations into the service caching replacement algorithm and adopt the distributed multi-agent approach for learning and training. Experimental results demonstrate that DSDM achieves significant performance improvements in reducing communication energy consumption compared to traditional methods across various scenarios.",

However, there are several managerial challenges associated with ML operations (MLOps). In this article, we outline three key challenges and discuss how an emerging type of AI platformâno-code AIâmay help organizations address and overcome them. We outline how no-code AI can leverage MLOps by closing the gap between business and technology experts, enabling faster iterations between problems and solutions, and aiding infrastructure management. After outlining the important remaining challenges associated with no-code AI and MLOps, we propose three managerial recommendations. By doing so, we provide insights into an important emerging phenomenon in AI software and set the stage for further research in the area.",

Drawing on the UTAUT model, we examined the mediating effect of trust in the relationships between these factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence). This study collected survey data through convenient sampling from 248 medical professionals working in medical institutions located in the metropolitan areas in Republic of Korea. The result showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence have a positive impact on trust, and this trust, in turn, has a significant influence on acceptance intentions. The results emphasize that the success of introducing innovative medical devices in institutions hinges not only on the devices' innovation level but also on the psychological factors of the professionals. By taking into account these factors and building trust, medical institutions can elevate service quality and efficiency, fostering greater acceptance of advanced medical devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMedicinal plants are offering a lot of potential for treatment of various chronic diseases as well as healing wounds, enhancing healthy living for consumers. The Nepalese and Indian agriculture systems are one of the main areas focusing on medicinal plant cultivation, and the abundant availability of these plants in these regions is driving growth in ayurvedic research. Traditional methods for detecting plants as well as generating insights on them are often inefficient and time-consuming due to the manual research need and expertise required in plant and biological lives. In this paper, we develop an advanced LLM (Large Language Model)-powered approach to reliably identify the available medicinal plants and their profitable insights for farmers. We compare multiple deep learning and transfer learning techniques, employing models such as deep convolutional neural networks and advanced transformer models. By training and testing on the dataset that includes varieties of plant types, we select the efficient model after a detailed analysis of a variety of models, dataset split variations, and hyperparameter tuning. The selected model integrates into a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application capable of providing various insights on the plant identified. The app supports both Nepali and English languages and integrates explainable AI for explaining medicinal plants, their health benefits, and remedies. Results show that the DeiT model achieves 95.97 % accuracy, VGG16 achieves 90.26 %, and a novel hybridized concept with DeiT + VGG16 achieves an accuracy of 96.75 % on a multi-class dataset. The integrated application explains the beneficial insights to users in English as well as local Nepali language.",

Body composition analysis in lung cancer screening (LCS) is very limited. This study aimed at assessing the association of subcutaneous fat volume (SFV) and subcutaneous fat density (SFD), measured on chest ultra-low dose computed tomography (ultra-LDCT) images by a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI)-based software, with clinical and anthropometric characteristics in a LCS population.\nMethods and results\nDemographic, clinical, and dietary data were obtained from the written questionnaire completed by each participant at the first visit, when anthropometric measurements, blood sample collection and chest ultra-LDCT were performed. Images were analyzed for automated 3D segmentation of subcutaneous fat and muscle.\nThe analysis included 938 volunteers (372 females); men with a smoking history of â¥40 pack-years had higher SFV (p = 0.0009), while former smokers had lower SFD (p = 0.0019). In female participants, SFV and SFD differed significantly according to age. SFV increased with rising BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and CRP levels â¥2 mg/L (p < 0.0001), whereas SFD decreased with rising BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and CRP levels â¥2 mg/L (p < 0.001) in both sexes. SFV was associated with glycemia and triglycerides levels (p = 0.0067 and p=<0.0001 in males, p = 0.0074 and p < 0.0001 in females, respectively), while SFD with triglycerides levels (p < 0.0001).\nConclusion\nWe observed different associations of SFV and SFD with age and smoking history between men and women, whereas the association with anthropometric data, CRP, glycemia and triglycerides levels was similar in the two sexes.",

Furthermore, this paper aims to investigate the challenges faced by organizations when implementing such technologies. This study followed a qualitative approach where semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from mid to senior managerial levels working in a leading bank operating in Jordan and had implemented the voice-based chatbot technology. Implementing voice-based chatbot technology for the first time in a Jordanian bank has positively impacted the growth of the bank, increased customers satisfaction, and added a competitive advantage value to the bank. On the other side, different challenges faced the bank when it implemented this technology like issues related to security, compliance, integration, and infrastructure limitations. This paper can be considered in the foremost research conducted to investigate the implementation of AI-based chatbot in Jordanian banks. It demonstrated the benefits and challenges resulting from performing digital innovations introduced as innovative services in the banking sector that can inform the experience to other banks interested to implement such technologies.",

Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the âhowâ), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the âideasâ), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the âwhatâ), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the âso whatâ). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a âfriendâ yet a âfoeâ, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is âcapableâ yet âdependentâ, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is âaccessibleâ yet ârestrictiveâ, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even âpopularâ when âbannedâ (i.e., the âwhatâ). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a RagnarÃ¶k that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the âso whatâ).",

In particular, the education sector is considered as one of the primary domains affected by this application, the impact of which remains yet to be fully understood. Furthermore, many Higher Education institutions are required to get to terms with its impact on teaching and learning, and to clarify their stances on the use of ChatGPT software. This study was developed to investigate some critical case studies considered as relevant to the inevitable re-evaluation of educational aspects needed, ranging from academic missions to student and course learning outcomes and its ethical uses. Following a review of some of the pros and cons of ChatGPT in the higher educational sector, this paper shall demonstrate several case studies of early trials in teaching and learning assessments related to various specializations. Next, the ability of some well-known AI detector software and analyzed in terms of their capacity to successfully detect AI-generated content. Analysis shall be made of the foreseen impact on important aspects including challenges and benefits related to its use in course assessments as well as academic integrity and ethical use. The study concludes with a set of recommendations made from our findings and benchmarks obtained from top universities in order to assist faculty members and decision makers at Higher Education institutions concerning their response strategy and use of ChatGPT.",

However, changing rainfall distribution and intensity due to environmental factors and climate change have become increasingly evident in recent years. This study aims to utilize machine learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict rainfall trends in the Kokrajhar region, a district in Assam, India. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for effective water resource management, agriculture planning, and disaster preparedness in the area. To achieve this objective, 31 years of historical rainfall data from Kokrajhar have been collected. Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests, MLP, ETS, and MEDIAN, have been employed. The models were trained and evaluated using the data set, with performance metrics mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results suggest that the ETS model (Average MAPE 424.11% after removing outliers) exhibited the best performance among the other models in the second fold. In the third fold, the MLP model outperformed the others. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AI and ML techniques in predicting rainfall trends in the Kokrajhar area.",

Early reports highlight promising benefits of AI in B2B marketing such as offering important insights into customer behaviors, identifying critical market insight, and streamlining operational inefficiencies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding concerning how organizations should structure their AI competencies for B2B marketing, and how these ultimately influence organizational performance. Drawing on AI competencies and B2B marketing literature, this study develops a conceptual research model that explores the effect that AI competencies have on B2B marketing capabilities, and in turn on organizational performance. The proposed research model is tested using 155 survey responses from European companies and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results highlight the mechanisms through which AI competencies influence B2B marketing capabilities, as well as how the later impact organizational performance.",

While there is a plethora of information about how AI may provide value to workplaces, research on how workers and AI can coexist in workplaces is evolving. It is critical to explore emerging themes and research agendas to understand the trajectory of scholarly research in this area. This study's overarching research question is how workers will coexist with AI in workplaces. A search protocol was employed to find relevant articles in Scopus, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases based on appropriate and specific keywords and article inclusion and exclusion criteria. We identified four themes: (1) Workers' distrust in workplace AI stems from perceiving it as a job threat, (2) Workplace AI entices worker-AI interactions by offering to augment worker abilities, (3) AI and worker coexistence require workers' technical, human, and conceptual skills, and (4) Workers need ongoing reskilling and upskilling to contribute to a symbiotic relationship with workplace AI. We then developed four propositions with relevant research questions for future research. This review makes four contributions: (1) it argues that an existential argument better explains workers' distrust in AI, (2) it gathers the required skills for worker and AI coexistence and groups them into technical, human, and conceptual skills, (3) it suggests that technical skills benefit coexistence but cannot outweigh human and conceptual skills, and (4) it offers 20 evidence-informed research questions to guide future scholarly inquiries.",

These inefficiencies not only escalate production costs but also tie up capital, compromise order flexibility, augment storage expenses, and prevent the capitalization on market opportunities. This paper explores the application of explainable AI to analyze process data within CNC setups, aiming to identify and elucidate patterns that contribute to prolonged setup durations. By implementing AI models with explanation methods, this research transparently highlights critical improvement points, facilitating targeted interventions to enhance production agility. The outcome is a dual advantage of reducing setup times and operational costs, thereby speeding up overall manufacturing processes. This approach emphasizes innovative manufacturing systems and provides practical insights on using artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency in CNC tool production.",

However, beyond their reported success, few comparisons exist with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods or standard mathematical models. Here, we test GANs performance, comparing them with a well-known mathematical model, namely a Markov chain. We implement comparative metrics based on one- and two-point statistics to evaluate the performance of each method. We find that, similarly to other AI approaches, GANs struggle to capture rare events and cross-feature relations and are unable to create synthetic faithful data. GANs are relatively successful in replicating the auto-correlation function, but they still lag significantly behind simple Markov chains. We also provide a qualitative explanation for this limitation of AI approaches.",

For instance, this technology has revolutionized industrials sectors, such as e-commerce, health, manufacturing, and entertainment, as well as, the educational sector. In this context, during the pandemic, educational institutions around the globe recognized the benefits of adopting remote learning and teaching based on many e-learning platforms. Hence, deploying virtual classrooms is not that easy, due to many constraints, such as time, technological cost, lack of interactivity of learners, and the unsuitability of the learner's cognitive abilities and learning style. To this end, understanding the learner's style and providing adapted and personalized content are the main concerns of today's e-learning systems. To this end, integrating efficient recommender systems into online learning environment is required in order to consider student's behaviors and preferences when recommending various learning materials. Thus, intelligent recommender systems are able to provide a personalized learning path in which the system adapts to the student's learning requirements and abilities. This review discusses the different applications, methods, and challenges of AI-based recommendation systems used to assist different stockholders in an online learning environment.",

To strengthen the competitiveness of the industry, there is an increasing need for flexible production, exploiting the capabilities of both the machinery and human workforce.\nThe JARVIS EU project aims to develop a reusable set of tools that enable AI driven multimodal means of interaction: i) involving interfaces for physical and remote information exchange, robot control and programming, ii) providing social skills to a variety of robots to achieve seamless user-centric interaction that extends human ability for complex tasks and iii) demonstrating scalability of application and ability to achieve economies at scale. The proposed technologies will be tested for flexibility, scalability, trustworthiness, and user acceptance in four use cases, aiming to demonstrate production line and cross sector applicability in Agile Manufacturing and Inspection and Maintenance (I&M). Each pilot has been carefully selected to challenge and thus highlight the capabilities of the proposed solutions, covering a range of needs for HRI, while keeping human in the loop.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nArtificial intelligence can facilitate inclusive approach to heritage planning.\nâ¢\nThis paper reveals the cultural significance attached to the heritage property.\nâ¢\nArtificial intelligence can contribute to value-based heritage planning.\nAbstract\nExperts have always played an important role in heritage planning, practice, and theory. There is a wealth of literature published every year regarding heritage and its cultural significance. Experts also contribute to heritage planning and developing policy documents. Still, literature is rarely used as a source of primary research to systematically reveal and compare expertsâ opinions on the cultural significance of built heritage. Analyzing them as a whole is costly and time-consuming, especially on built heritage, when much has been written about. While the automation of methods has proven to mitigate such restrictions in other fields, as digital humanities, their application in heritage planning, practice, and theory is still scarce. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the potentials of AI models (e.g., multi label text classification) in analyzing scientific documents, revealing the cultural significance of built heritage, values and attributes. This was done to better understand the similarities and differences between the expertsâ opinions. Yazd, Iran, is taken a case study, with a particular focus on windcatchers, a key attribute conveying cultural significance, of outstanding universal value, due to its inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This paper has three subsequent phases: 1) state of the art on the application of AI in heritage planning; 2) methodology of data collection and data analysis related to coding values and attributes of windcatchers, addressed in relevant documents; 3) preliminary findings on the expertsâ opinions over values and attributes of windcatchers. Results contribute to the scientific discussion, revealing the cultural significance of windcatchers of Yazd from expertsâ point of view. Besides, the potential of AI for heritage planning is revealed in terms of (de)coding and measuring the cultural significance of built heritage from the available documents, showing the opinions of experts with various backgrounds. This model can be applied to other key attributes in Yazd and other case studies and scales to support heritage planning, practice, and theory.",

ETDRS zoning divides the macula into nine different regions. In 15 patients with radial scanning OCT, the average thickness and volume of retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroid in these regions were measured. In 30 patients with radial or horizontal scanning OCT, based on the anatomical structure, the macula is divided into seven segments. Mean Sattler layerâchoriocapillaris complex thickness (SLCCT), Haller layer thickness, and total choroidal thickness were measured for each segment using AI-assisted OCT.\nResults\nWe recruited 30 patients (59 eyes) with MMD. In the 15 patients (29 eyes) who underwent radial scanning OCT, no significant change in retina, RNFL, GCL, and choroidal thickness was identified between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant change in retina, RNFL, or choroidal volume between the two groups in different ETDRS macula regions (p > 0.05). The GCL volume in the macula's inner ring nasal portion (IN) was significantly lower. SLCCTs were considerably reduced in six macula regions in moyamoya groups (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant change in Haller layer thickness. Only the nasal perifovea (PE_N) exhibited a significant variation in choroidal thickness. The Moyamoya group showed reduced choroidal thickness in PE_N segment.\nConclusion\nIn patients with MMD, there is thinning of the Sattler layerâchoriocapillaris complex in the choroid.",

While predictive modeling in finance often focuses on volatility, there is a notable lack of research on predicting actual stock prices, particularly in the African market. This study addresses this gap by utilizing Airtel stock data from Yahoo Finance, spanning June 28, 2019, to May 8, 2024. The research employs the GARCH model to extract statistical properties, which are then combined with historical prices and fed into LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models leading to GARCH-LSTM, GARCH-GRU, GARCH-Transfomer hybrid models. These hybrid models are benchmarked against standalone LSTM, GRU and Transfomer models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-squared metrics. Results indicate that hybrid models, especially GARCH-LSTM, significantly outperform standalone models. This integration of GARCH with advanced AI models offers a more robust framework for stock price prediction, enhancing accuracy and reliability in forecasting future prices.",

It will also use the WASPAS method to analyze the criteria used during the selection stages, aiming to optimize the effectiveness of the process. The article employed a two-phase methodological approach to enhance candidate selection analysis. The CRITIC Method assigned weights to criteria, while the WASPAS Method ranked alternatives based on these weights. A sensitivity analysis, specifically for the WASPAS method, further assessed its robustness and consistency, providing a comprehensive view of the decision-making process. Twelve experienced professionals from various sectors, all decision-makers, participated in the research. As a result of the CRITIC method C5 (31.45%) âData Confidentialityâ is the most important criteria, followed by C1 (25.92%) âJusticeâ. Furthermore, in the selection process using AI with the WASPAS method, statements A14 and A15 stand out in the final stage, automating the identification of the most suitable candidates for the position and carefully evaluating them. Meanwhile, A9, in the cognitive and behavioral testing stage, is crucial for identifying promising candidates based on objective results, ensuring an accurate fit between candidate and position and increasing the efficiency of the selection process.",

To deal with the challenges as well as to pick up on the opportunities associated with AI, university students need to acquire a basic understanding of AI (so-called AI literacy). To design effective study programs that foster AI competencies, it is necessary to assess the state of students' AI literacy. While there already are some AI literacy tests available, many instruments focus on specific AI courses, rely primarily on self-assessment, or do not provide detailed psychometric information. This study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test and to provide initial insights into the current state of AI literacy among German university students. We present a validated multiple-choice test to assess AI literacy in higher education. The results suggest that there is a significant variance in AI literacy among students, with most showing a fundamental understanding of AI. AI literacy is higher among students with a technical study background or prior experience in AI. The results imply that there is a need for effective AI courses for a broader audience of students who use AI in their daily lives and will use AI tools in their future careers. Furthermore, educators should consider the variance of studentsâ prior knowledge when designing AI courses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCervical cancer is a cancer that remains a significant global health challenge all over the world. Due to improper screening in the early stages, and healthcare disparities, a large number of women are suffering from this disease, and the mortality rate increases day by day. Hence, in these studies, we presented a precise approach utilizing six different machine learning models (decision tree, logistic regression, naÃ¯ve bayes, random forest, k nearest neighbors, support vector machine), which can predict the early stage of cervical cancer by analysing 36 risk factor attributes of 858 individuals. In addition, two data balancing techniquesâSynthetic Minority Oversampling Technique and Adaptive Synthetic Samplingâwere used to mitigate the data imbalance issues. Furthermore, Chi-square and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator are two distinct feature selection processes that have been applied to evaluate the feature rank, which are mostly correlated to identify the particular disease, and also integrate an explainable artificial intelligence technique, namely Shapley Additive Explanations, for clarifying the model outcome. The applied machine learning model outcome is evaluated by performance evaluation matrices, namely accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1-score, false-positive rate and false-negative rate, and area under the Receiver operating characteristic curve score. The decision tree outperformed in Chi-square feature selection with outstanding accuracy with 97.60%, 98.73% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and 98.73% precision, respectively. During the data imbalance, DT performed 97% accuracy, 99.35% sensitivity, 69.23% specificity, and 97.45% precision. This research is focused on developing diagnostic frameworks with automated tools to improve the detection and management of cervical cancer, as well as on helping healthcare professionals deliver more efficient and personalized care to their patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nOpen AI's ChatGPT has emerged as a popular AI language model that can engage in natural language conversations with users. Based on a qualitative research approach using semistructured interviews with 32 ChatGPT users from India, this study examined the factors influencing users' acceptance and use of ChatGPT using the unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT) model. The study results demonstrated that the four factors of UTAUT, along with two extended constructs, i.e. perceived interactivity and privacy concerns, can explain users' interaction and engagement with ChatGPT. The study also found that age and experience can moderate the impact of various factors on the use of ChatGPT. The theoretical and practical implications of the study were also discussed.",

While self-examinations and professional screenings are recommended, they are rarely performed. Mobile health (mHealth) apps utilising artificial intelligence (AI) for skin cancer screening offer a potential solution to aid self-examinations; however, their uptake is low. Therefore, the aim of this research was to examine provider and user characteristics influencing people's decisions to seek skin cancer screening performed by a mHealth app or a dermatologist.\nMethods\nTwo forced-choice conjoint experiments with Nmain = 1591 and Nreplication = 308 participants from the United States were conducted online to investigate preferences for screening providers. In addition to the provider type (mHealth app vs dermatologist), the following provider attributes were manipulated: costs, expertise, privacy policy, and result details. Subsequently, a questionnaire assessed various user characteristics, including demographics, attitudes toward AI technology and medical mistrust.\nResults\nOutcomes were consistent across the two studies. The provider type was the most influential factor, with the dermatologist being selected more often than the mHealth app. Cost, expertise, and privacy policy also significantly impacted decisions. Demographic subgroup analyses showed rather consistent preference trends across various age, gender, and ethnicity groups. Individuals with greater medical mistrust were more inclined to choose the mHealth app. Trust, accuracy, and quality ratings were higher for the dermatologist, whether selected or not.\nConclusion\nOur results offer valuable insights for technology developers, healthcare providers, and policymakers, contributing to unlocking the potential of skin cancer screening apps in bridging healthcare gaps in underserved communities.",

ALFABETO (ALL-FAster-BEtter-TOgether) is a tool created to support healthcare professionals in the triage, mainly in optimizing hospital admissions.\nMethods\nThe AI was trained during the pandemic's âfirst waveâ (February-April 2020). Our aim was to assess the performance during the âthird waveâ of the pandemics (February-April 2021) and evaluate its evolution. The neural network proposed behavior (hospitalization vs home care) was compared with what was actually done. If there were discrepancies between ALFABETO's predictions and clinicians' decisions, the disease's progression was monitored. Clinical course was defined as âfavorable/mildâ if patients could be managed at home or in spoke centers and âunfavorable/severeâ if patients need to be managed in a hub center.\nResults\nALFABETO showed accuracy of 76%, AUROC of 83%; specificity was 78% and recall 74%. ALFABETO also showed high precision (88%). 81 hospitalized patients were incorrectly predicted to be in âhome careâ class. Among those âhome-caredâ by the AI and âhospitalizedâ by the clinicians, 3 out of 4 misclassified patients (76.5%) showed a favorable/mild clinical course. ALFABETOâs performance matched the reports in literature.\nConclusions\nThe discrepancies mostly occurred when the AI predicted patients could stay at home but clinicians hospitalized them; these cases could be handled in spoke centers rather than hubs, and the discrepancies may aid clinicians in patient selection. The interaction between AI and human experience has the potential to improve both AI performance and our comprehension of pandemic management.",

Despite the widespread implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered conversational agents, there is still a limited understanding of how customers use and resist these technologies for shopping. To address this gap, this study investigates factors that influence the usage and resistance of AI-based conversational agents for shopping using the extended behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) and partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). To test the proposed framework, this study conducted two empirical studies in South Korea. Study 1 focused on text-based chatbots with a sample of 232 participants, while Study 2 examined voice-based chatbots with a sample of 234 participants. The results of the both studies mainly supported the hypotheses driven by the extended BRT. Theoretically, this study contributes by offering a comprehensive understanding of customer motivation, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward the use of AI-powered conversational agents in shopping. Managerially, this study provides important insights for retail managers and developers of AI-powered conversational agents for shopping. By understanding the factors that drive customer usage and resistance, managers, and developers can better design and deploy these innovative technologies to enhance the customer experience and improve business outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEven though the benefits of e-commerce for Small and Medium-Sized (SMEs) are enormous, not many SMEs have adopted e-commerce, especially in Palestine. Therefore, knowing what factors encourage SMEs to adopt e-commerce is necessary. However, e-commerce research has only been carried out on large-scale businesses. In contrast, studies on SMEs companies, especially regarding adopting e-commerce, have not been widely conducted. So, this research is important to determine what factors drive the adoption of e-commerce and the effect on marketing performance in Palestinian SMEs. The study's theoretical foundation is based on the TOE framework with AI Integration, Innovation Culture, and Customer Tech-Savviness. Using a simple random sampling technique from an online questionnaire, 305 SMEs were chosen as the sample for the study. The data were evaluated using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to explore the relationships among exogenous, mediator, and endogenous variables. Based on the study's results, it can be concluded that AI Integration, Customer Savviness, innovative culture, competitive pressure and business partner pressure factors positively and significantly influence e-commerce adoption. In addition, adopting E-commerce positively and significantly affects SMEs' Marketing Performance. Based on the results of this study, theoretical implications for E-Commerce adoption in Palestinian SMEs and managerial implications are recommended accordingly.",

Speech data from AD patients can aid in diagnosing AD since the speech features have common patterns independent of race and spoken language. However, previous models for diagnosing AD from speech data have often focused on the characteristics of a single language, with no guarantee of scalability to other languages. In this study, we used the same method to extract acoustic features from two language datasets to diagnose AD.\nMethods\nUsing the Korean and English speech datasets, we used ten models capable of real-time AD and healthy control classification, regardless of language type. Four machine learning models were based on hand-crafted features, while the remaining six deep learning models utilized non-explainable features.\nResults\nThe highest accuracy achieved by the machine learning models was 0.73 and 0.69 for the Korean and English speech datasets, respectively. The deep learning models' maximum achievable accuracy reached 0.75 and 0.78, with their minimum classification time of 0.01s and 0.02s. These findings reveal the modelsâ robustness regardless of Korean and English and real-time diagnosis of AD through a 30-s voice sample.\nConclusion\nNon-explainable deep learning models that directly acquire voice representations surpassed machine learning models utilizing hand-crafted features in AD diagnosis. In addition, these AI models could confirm the possibility of extending to a language-agnostic AD diagnosis.",

The advanced capability of GAI tools and their rapid uptake by students has brought both challenges and opportunities to language teachers. This qualitative study, using in-depth individual and group interviews with ten beginning teachers and seventeen first-year English language teachers, explored their readiness for using GAI tools in their professional work and their perceptions of GAI in language teaching. The study found that first-year teachers were generally ready for the use of GAI tools and could recognize its potential to support their professional work. This was largely due to their experiences using ChatGPT. However, beginning teachers were not ready to use GAI tools in their professional work and had little knowledge about them. The study provides insights into the participantsâ GAI readiness; awareness of GAI tools and their capabilities and functions; utilization of GAI tools for language teaching; views towards students' use of GAI tools; and thoughts on how to prepare language learners to use GAI tools productively and critically. The study has implications for the preparation and professional development of early career teachers in the GAI-age.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs digital services are increasingly being deployed and used in a variety of domains, the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is a matter of concern. Artificial intelligence is driving some of this growth but its environmental cost remains scarcely studied. A recent trend in large-scale generative models such as ChatGPT has especially drawn attention since their training requires intensive use of a massive number of specialized computing resources. The inference of those models is made accessible on the web as services, and using them additionally mobilizes end-user terminals, networks, and data centers. Therefore, those services contribute to global warming, worsen metal scarcity, and increase energy consumption. This work proposes an LCA-based methodology for a multi-criteria evaluation of the environmental impact of generative AI services, considering embodied and usage costs of all the resources required for training models, inferring from them, and hosting them online. We illustrate our methodology with Stable Diffusion as a service, an open-source text-to-image generative deep-learning model accessible online. This use case is based on an experimental observation of Stable Diffusion training and inference energy consumption. Through a sensitivity analysis, various scenarios estimating the influence of usage intensity on the impact sources are explored.",

    "abstract": "As the complexity of deep learning (DL) networks and training data grows enormously, methods that scale with computation are becoming the future of artificial intelligence (AI) development. In this regard, the interplay between machine learning (ML) and high-performance computing (HPC) is an innovative paradigm to speed up the efficiency of AI research and development. However, building and operating an HPC/AI converged system require broad knowledge to leverage the latest computing, networking, and storage technologies. Moreover, an HPC-based AI computing environment needs an appropriate resource allocation and monitoring strategy to efficiently utilize the system resources. In this regard, we introduce a technique for building and operating a high-performance AI-computing environment with the latest technologies. Specifically, an HPC/AI converged system is configured inside Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), called GIST AI-X computing cluster, which is built by leveraging the latest Nvidia DGX servers, high-performance storage and networking devices, and various open source tools. Therefore, it can be a good reference for building a small or middle-sized HPC/AI converged system for research and educational institutes. In addition, we propose a resource allocation method for DL jobs to efficiently utilize the computing resources with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (mDRL). Through extensive simulations and experiments, we validate that the proposed mDRL algorithm can help the HPC/AI converged cluster to achieve both system utilization and power consumption improvement. By deploying the proposed resource allocation method to the system, total job completion time is reduced by around 20% and inefficient power consumption is reduced by around 40%.",

The research presented here explores how GAI can enhance creativity and assist Design practitioners with tasks to create products such as, but not limited to, renderings, concepts, construction techniques, materials, data analytics or maps. We apply a framework of combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity to organize how recent advancements in GAI can support each creative category. We propose a conceptual framework of GAI towards transformational creativity, and identify real-world examples to demonstrate GAI's impact, such as transforming sketches into detailed renders, facilitating real-time 3D model generation, predicting trends through analytics and creating images or reports via text prompts. Our work envisions a future where GAI becomes a real-time collaborator to complete certain automated tasks while liberating Designers to focus on transformational innovation.",

This is partly because a comprehensive survey of past research activity has never performed due to the massive scale and diversity of published information. Here we compiled 254,738 articles on AMR using Artificial Intelligence (AI; i.e., Natural Language Processing, NLP) methods to create a database and information retrieval system for knowledge extraction on research perfomed over the last 20 years. Global maps were created that describe regional, methodological, and sectoral AMR research activities that confirm limited intersectoral research has been performed, which is key to guiding science-informed policy solutions to AMR, especially in low-income countries (LICs). Further, we show greater harmonisation in research methods across sectors and regions is urgently needed. For example, differences in analytical methods used among sectors in AMR research, such as employing culture-based versus genomic methods, results in poor communication between sectors and partially explains why One Health-based solutions are not ensuing. Therefore, our analysis suggest that performing culture-based and genomic AMR analysis in tandem in all sectors is crucial for data integration and holistic One Health solutions. Finally, increased investment in capacity development in LICs should be prioritised as they are places where the AMR burden is often greatest. Our open-access database and AI methodology can be used to further develop, disseminate, and create new tools and practices for AMR knowledge and information sharing.",

We introduce an Adversarial CoevoluTION (ACTION) framework, which showcases AIâs capacity to evolve adaptable policies capable of responding to dynamic changes and adversarial actions in HADR wargame scenarios. The framework presented employs a grammar-based genetic programming algorithm to evolve intelligent and interpretable player policies. We apply the ACTION framework to a HADR wargame case study, commonly used by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group for research purposes. The case study centres on a hypothetical disaster relief scenario in the fictional Joadia Islands, struck by a tsunami, necessitating the evacuation of dispersed civilians. Experimental results illustrate that the ACTION framework can evolve policies that adapt to environmental uncertainties and respond effectively to adversarial actions. This study offers evidence of the potential and practical application of AI-enabled technology in real-life humanitarian situations.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe loss-of-function (LOF) classification of most missense variants in tumor suppressor breast cancer genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51C remains unclassified and confounds clinical actionability. Classifying these variants is challenging due to their rarity, leading clinicians to rely on in silico predictive methods. Protein stability changes are associated with function, making stability predictors valuable. Stability predictions upon missense variant perturbations require high-resolution protein structures. However, the availability of these high-resolution structures is lacking. This study explores using generative AI to predict high-resolution protein structures, which can then be analyzed with in silico protein stability prediction methods to assess LOF activity in ordered regions of the protein. This study also determines the appropriate in silico protein stability and dedicated in silico missense prediction methods in dbNSFP v4.7 database to predict LOF activity in ordered regions of these four genes. Functional classifications from homology recombination DNA repair (HDR) assays and variant classifications from the ClinVar database provide a reliable dataset for evaluating the performance of these in silico prediction methods.\nResults\nComplex AlphaFold2 structures of the BRCA1-C terminal (BRCT) domain and the DNA-binding (DB) domain of BRCA2, analyzed using protein stability tool FoldX predicts LOF activity from missense variants significantly better than experimentally-derived structures in ordered regions. The BRCT domain achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC)= 0.861 (95 % CI:0.858â0.863) and AUC= 0.842 (95 % CI:0.840â0.845), while the DB domain achieved an AUC= 0.836 (95 % CI:0.8322â0.841), compared to AUC= 0.847 (95 % CI:0.844â0.850) and AUC= 0.835 (95 % CI:0.832â0.837) from the BRCT domain, and AUC= 0.830 (95 % CI:0.821â0.8320) from the DB domain from experimentally-derived structures. Protein stability does not predict LOF activity from missense variants better than dedicated in silico missense predictors. Overall, we find that AlphaMissense ranks highly, with an average AUC= 0.890 (95 % CI 0.886â0.895) from ordered regions across these four cancer genes, compared to all other in silico missense predictors present in the dbNSFP database.\nConclusions\nThe study reveals that generative AI protein predicted structures can outperform experimentally-derived structures in evaluating LOF activity from predicted protein stability in ordered regions of genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C. The study also highlights the predictive performance of AlphaMissense as the premier in silico missense prediction method to predict LOF activity from missense variants in these four tumor suppressor breast cancer genes.

The aim of our study is to examine several factors that may be implicated in teachers' motivation and engagement to harness genAI in teaching and learning. We examined contextual (i.e., autonomy-supportive leadership, autonomy-thwarting leadership), occupational experience (i.e., professional growth striving, change-related stress), and background factors (i.e., gender, age, teaching experience, contract length, class size, school level) as predictors of motivation (i.e., genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities). Among 339 Australian teachers, our findings revealed that perceived autonomy-supportive leadership, professional growth striving, and change-related stress were linked with greater genAI valuing. In turn, genAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in both teaching-related work and student learning activities. Perceived autonomy-thwarting leadership was directly linked with greater genAI integration in student learning activities, and professional growth striving was directly associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work. Teachersâ gender and school level were also linked with the motivation and engagement factors, and there were several indirect associations as well. Our results pinpoint areas of focus for future research, policy, and practice to support genAI and its application in schools.",

Incorporating AI into healthcare systems has the ability not only to improve diagnosis and treatment procedures, but also to optimize resource allocation.\nObjective\nThis study aims to get a deeper understanding of radiologists' perspectives on the incorporation of AI in the area of radiology in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this qualitative study is to provide recommendations that will enhance the growth and performance of the nation's radiography workforce.\nMethods\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey to collect data on the demographic features, knowledge, perceptions, and practices linked to AI among radiologists and subspecialties. A suitable sample of 129 radiologists was selected and the data were analyzed using chi-squared testing to compare factors.\nResults\nOur study indicates that out of 129 radiologists, 89 (69.0%) respondents, who had heard about AI, had a basic knowledge of artificial intelligence/deep learning/machine learning. While the majority of the participants had a positive outlook, 17.0% of participants indicated concern that AI will replace their jobs.\nConclusion\nThe findings of the study provide a comprehensive overview of the current level of understanding and utilization of AI in radiology among the radiologists in the region. The results suggest that radiologists have a basic knowledge of AI, and they are eager to incorporate it into their field; however, there is a need for further training to increase the radiologists' applications in the field.",

Speech data from AD patients can aid in diagnosing AD since the speech features have common patterns independent of race and spoken language. However, previous models for diagnosing AD from speech data have often focused on the characteristics of a single language, with no guarantee of scalability to other languages. In this study, we used the same method to extract acoustic features from two language datasets to diagnose AD.\nMethods\nUsing the Korean and English speech datasets, we used ten models capable of real-time AD and healthy control classification, regardless of language type. Four machine learning models were based on hand-crafted features, while the remaining six deep learning models utilized non-explainable features.\nResults\nThe highest accuracy achieved by the machine learning models was 0.73 and 0.69 for the Korean and English speech datasets, respectively. The deep learning models' maximum achievable accuracy reached 0.75 and 0.78, with their minimum classification time of 0.01s and 0.02s. These findings reveal the modelsâ robustness regardless of Korean and English and real-time diagnosis of AD through a 30-s voice sample.\nConclusion\nNon-explainable deep learning models that directly acquire voice representations surpassed machine learning models utilizing hand-crafted features in AD diagnosis. In addition, these AI models could confirm the possibility of extending to a language-agnostic AD diagnosis.",

The advanced capability of GAI tools and their rapid uptake by students has brought both challenges and opportunities to language teachers. This qualitative study, using in-depth individual and group interviews with ten beginning teachers and seventeen first-year English language teachers, explored their readiness for using GAI tools in their professional work and their perceptions of GAI in language teaching. The study found that first-year teachers were generally ready for the use of GAI tools and could recognize its potential to support their professional work. This was largely due to their experiences using ChatGPT. However, beginning teachers were not ready to use GAI tools in their professional work and had little knowledge about them. The study provides insights into the participantsâ GAI readiness; awareness of GAI tools and their capabilities and functions; utilization of GAI tools for language teaching; views towards students' use of GAI tools; and thoughts on how to prepare language learners to use GAI tools productively and critically. The study has implications for the preparation and professional development of early career teachers in the GAI-age.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntroduction\nIntelligent virtual and AI-based collimation functionalities have the potential to enable an efficient workflow for radiographers, but the specific impact on clinical routines is still unknown. This study analyzes primarily the influence of intelligent collimation functionalities on the examination time and the number of needed interactions with the radiography system.\nMethods\nAn observational study was conducted on the use of three camera-based intelligent features at five clinical sites in Europe and the USA: AI-based auto thorax collimation (ATC), smart virtual ortho (SVO) collimation for stitched long-leg and full-spine examinations, and virtual collimation (VC) at the radiography system workstation. Two people conducted semi-structured observations during routine examinations to collect data with the functionalities either activated or deactivated.\nResults\nMedian exam duration was 31 vs. 45 s (p < 0.0001) for 95 thorax examinations with ATC and 94 without ATC. For stitched orthopedic examinations, 34 were performed with SVO and 40 without SVO, and the median exam duration was 62 vs. 82 s (p < 0.0001). The median time for setting the ortho range â i.e., the time between setting the upper and the lower limits of the collimation field â was 7 vs. 16 s for 39 examinations with SVO and 43 without SVO (p < 0.0001). In 109 thorax examinations with ATC and 112 without ATC, the median number of system interactions was 1 vs. 2 (p < 0.0001). VC was used to collimate in 2.4% and to check the collimation field in 68.5% of 292 observed chest and other examinations.\nConclusion\nATC and SVO enable the radiographer to save time during chest or stitched examinations. Additionally, ATC reduces machine interactions during chest examinations.\nImplications for practice\nSystem and artificial intelligence can support the radiographer during the image acquisition by providing a more efficient workflow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate and timely evaluation and assessment of emission data and its impact on environmental status has been a key challenge due to the conventional manual approach utilized for independently computing most emission parameters. To resolve this long-standing issue, we proposed an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Decision Tree model to adequately classify Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) status based on multiple Emission Parameters. The model's performance was systematically evaluated using multiple emission parameters obtained from a two-stroke motorcycle dataset collected in Nigeria across various metrics such as K-S Statistics, Confusion Matrix, Correlation Heat Map, Decision Tree, Validation Curve, and Threshold Plot. The K-S Statistics plot's experimental results showed a considerable correlation between HC, CO, and the target variable, with values ranging from 0.75 to 0.80. At the same time, CO2 and O2 do not correlate with the target variable with values between 0.00 and 0.09. The Confusion Matrix revealed that the proposed model has an overall accuracy of 99.9% with 481 true positive predictions and 75 true negative predictions, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed AI-driven model. In conclusion, our proposed AI-driven model can effectively classify EPA status based on multiple emission parameters with high accuracy, which may spur positive advancement in policy enhancement for proper environmental management.",

To increase the sensor data dimensionality, temperature cycled operation (TCO) and impedance spectroscopy (IS) readout was proposed, enabling the acquisition of large datasets from a single sensor, as suitable to be exploited by machine learning techniques. Furthermore, recent studies have shown how the IS readout minimizes the issues represented by the sensor long-term signal drift. The aim of this work is the development of a smart system-in-package, integrating a state-of-the-art micromachined MOX gas sensor based on a wafer-level nanostructured sensing layer with a novel versatile sensor interface chip, capable of high performance IS readout. We propose a miniaturized sensing device, which is a small, lightweight low power consumption chemical sensing micro-system with fast and accurate classification capabilities, suitable to be deployed in long multi-node sensing cables or on unmanned aerial vehicles. A software suite comprising a sensor training wizard was also developed, enabling users with no technical background to train the sensing system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAlzheimerâs disease, characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of cognitive functions, represents a significant health concern, particularly among older adults, as it stands as the foremost cause of dementia. Despite its debilitating nature, early detection of Alzheimerâs disease holds considerable advantages for affected individuals. This study investigates machine-learning methodologies for the early diagnosis of Alzheimerâs disease, utilizing datasets sourced from OASIS and ADNI. The initial classification methods consist of a 5-class ADNI classification and a 3-class OASIS classification. Three unique methodologies encompass binary-class inter-dataset models, which involve training on a single dataset and subsequently testing on another dataset for both ADNI and OASIS datasets. Additionally, a hybrid dataset model is also considered. The proposed methodology entails the concatenation of both datasets, followed by shuffling and subsequently conducting training and testing on the amalgamated dataset. The findings demonstrate impressive levels of accuracy, as Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) achieved a 99.63% accuracy rate for 5-class ADNI classification and a 95.75% accuracy rate by Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for 3-class OASIS classification, both when hyperparameter tweaking was implemented. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 87.50% in ADNI-OASIS (2 Class) when utilizing the Select K Best method. The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance in the OASIS-ADNI approach, attaining an accuracy of 77.97% using Chi-squared feature selection. The accuracy achieved by the Hybrid method, which utilized LGBM with hyperparameter optimization, was 99.21%. Furthermore, the utilization of Explainable AI approaches, particularly Lime, was implemented in order to augment the interpretability of the model.",

    "abstract": "Summary\nBackground\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed to reduce false-positive screens, increase cancer detection rates (CDRs), and address resourcing challenges faced by breast screening programs. We compared the accuracy of AI versus radiologists in real-world population breast cancer screening, and estimated potential impacts on CDR, recall and workload for simulated AI-radiologist reading.\nMethods\nExternal validation of a commercially-available AI algorithm in a retrospective cohort of 108,970 consecutive mammograms from a population-based screening program, with ascertained outcomes (including interval cancers by registry linkage). Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for AI were compared with radiologists who interpreted the screens in practice. CDR and recall were estimated for simulated AI-radiologist reading (with arbitration) and compared with program metrics.\nFindings\nThe AUC for AI was 0.83 compared with 0.93 for radiologists. At a prospective threshold, sensitivity for AI (0.67; 95% CI: 0.64â0.70) was comparable to radiologists (0.68; 95% CI: 0.66â0.71) with lower specificity (0.81 [95% CI: 0.81â0.81] versus 0.97 [95% CI: 0.97â0.97]). Recall rate for AI-radiologist reading (3.14%) was significantly lower than for the BSWA program (3.38%) (â0.25%; 95% CI: â0.31 to â0.18; P < 0.001). CDR was also lower (6.37 versus 6.97 per 1000) (â0.61; 95% CI: â0.77 to â0.44; P < 0.001); however, AI detected interval cancers that were not found by radiologists (0.72 per 1000; 95% CI: 0.57â0.90). AI-radiologist reading increased arbitration but decreased overall screen-reading volume by 41.4% (95% CI: 41.2â41.6).\nInterpretation\nReplacement of one radiologist by AI (with arbitration) resulted in lower recall and overall screen-reading volume. There was a small reduction in CDR for AI-radiologist reading. AI detected interval cases that were not identified by radiologists, suggesting potentially higher CDR if radiologists were unblinded to AI findings. These results indicate AI's potential role as a screen-reader of mammograms, but prospective trials are required to determine whether CDR could improve if AI detection was actioned in double-reading with arbitration.\nFunding\nNational Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAberrant intestinal epithelial barrier function is the primary pathology of Ulcerative colitis (UC), making it a desirable drug target. In this study, our small-molecule compound AI-34 exerted a significant protective effect in an LPS-induced epithelial barrier injury model. In vitro, AI-34 treatment significantly decreased cell permeability, increased transmembrane resistance, and maintained the junctional protein (ZO-1 and E-cadherin) levels in monolayer cells. Using the LiP-small molecule mapping approach (LiP-SMap), we demonstrated that AI-34 binds to 14-3-3Î¶. AI-34 promoted the interaction between 14-3-3Î¶ and Î²-catenin, decreasing the ubiquitination of Î²-catenin and thus maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier function. Finally, AI-34 triggered the stabilization of Î²-catenin mediated by 14-3-3Î¶, provoking a significant improvement in the DSS-induced colitis model. Our findings suggest that AI-34 may be a promising candidate for UC treatment.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (208KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study explores the reasons (for and against) the adoption of AI in the hospitality industry among Pakistani customers. The hypothesis was tested using the sample obtained from Pakistani hospitality customers. The data is collected via an online survey and analyzed with the structural equation modeling and PROCESS macro. The study results indicate that cultural values positively associate reasons for, attitudes, and intentions to adopt. Moreover, the results prove that attitude mediates the relationship between reasons (for and against) and intention to adopt AI services in hospitality. Furthermore, the finding shows that customer emotional intelligence has no moderation effect on attitude and intention to adopt AI services. This study highlights technological complexity and safety concerns are the most significant barriers in the studied context. Further, addressing reason against (technological complexity and safety concerns) may allow policymakers to lessen the present customer attitude-intention gap by tackling the factors that cause customers to resist adopting AI services in hospitality. In this respect, marketers should develop a marketing campaign strategy focusing on the benefits of the adoption of AI services in comparison to employee service. This is the first empirical study examining cultural values, reasons (for and against) attitudes, their relationship with intentions, and moderating role of an attractive, important, yet ignored variable, customer emotional intelligence. This study confirms that the behavioral reasoning theory can better describe the customers' adoption behavior of AI services in the hospitality sector.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe synergy of Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and Internet of Things in smart city camera-based surveillance offers notable advantages in resource allocation. Traditional approaches involving constant video data streaming to central servers incur significant bandwidth and storage costs. Our contribution involves proposing a cost-effective, lightweight Edge AI Enabled IoT Framework for Secure Smart Home Infrastructure, utilising a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and the open-source software motion for camera surveillance. The motion program monitors video signals from various cameras and triggers specific actions upon detecting movement. The framework efficiently notifies the smart home owner via email and smartphone message when motion is detected. We integrated four advanced motion detection and alert notification methodologies, conducting a thorough evaluation that positioned our framework as superior to existing solutions. Our research showcases impressive accuracy rates of 91% and 85% in indoor and outdoor scenarios, with minimal average delays of 12.8 seconds for email alerts and 1.6 seconds for messages which is approximately 41.6 % less than the state of the art methodologies. This innovative integration not only elevates surveillance capabilities but also establishes a swift and reliable alert system, contributing significantly to the efficiency and security of smart home environments.",

The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and regulatory frameworks such as the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) and the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) specify requirements on specimen and data provenance to ensure the quality and traceability of data used in AI development. In this paper, a framework is presented for recording and publishing provenance information to meet these requirements. The framework is based on the use of standardized models and protocols, such as the W3C PROV model and the ISO 23494 series, to capture and record provenance information at various stages of the data generation and analysis process. The framework and use case illustrate the role of provenance information in supporting the development of high-quality AI algorithms in biotechnology. Finally, the principles of the framework are illustrated in a simple computational pathology use case, showing how specimen and data provenance can be used in the development and documentation of an AI algorithm. The use case demonstrates the importance of managing and integrating distributed provenance information and highlights the complex task of considering factors such as semantic interoperability, confidentiality, and the verification of authenticity and integrity.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human lives and have gained increasing attention as the tenth leading cause of global mortality. This study addresses the pressing issue of brain tumor classification using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It focuses on distinguishing between Low-Grade Gliomas (LGG) and High-Grade Gliomas (HGG). LGGs are benign and typically manageable with surgical resection, while HGGs are malignant and more aggressive. The research introduces an innovative custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model, Glioma-CNN. GliomaCNN stands out as a lightweight CNN model compared to its predecessors. The research utilized the BraTS 2020 dataset for its experiments. Integrated with the gradient-boosting algorithm, GliomaCNN has achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.1569%. The modelâs interpretability is ensured through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM++). They provide insights into critical decision-making regions for classification outcomes. Despite challenges in identifying tumors in images without visible signs, the model demonstrates remarkable performance in this critical medical application, offering a promising tool for accurate brain tumor diagnosis which paves the way for enhanced early detection and treatment of brain tumors.",

AI is increasingly shaping the employment context: such emerging areas are augmented and automated decision-making. As AI-based decision-making is fuelled by personal data, compliance with data protection frameworks is inevitable. Even though automated decision-making is already addressed by the European norms on data protection â especially the GDPR â, their application in the world of work raises specific questions. The paper examines, in the light of the âgeneralâ data protection background, what specific data protection challenges are raised in the field of AI-based automated decision-making in the context of employment. As a result of the research, the paper provides a detailed overview on the European legal framework on the data protection aspects of AI-based automated decision-making in the employment context. It identifies the main challenges, such as the applicability of the existing legal framework to the current use-cases and the specific questions relating to the lawful bases in the world of work, and provides guidelines on how to address these challenges.",

As such, basic understanding and knowledge of AI should be a critical component of student education to foster successful global citizens. This position paper describes one possible path to address potential gaps in AI education and integrate AI across the curriculum at a traditional research university. The University of Florida (UF) is infusing AI across the curriculum and developing opportunities for student engagement within identified areas of AI literacy regardless of student discipline. The AI Across the Curriculum initiative being developed at UF will make AI education a cornerstone opportunity for all students. The ultimate goal of AI Across the Curriculum is the creation of an AI-ready workforce covering the essential 21st-century competencies identified as workforce and government needs worldwide. Qualified human capital is essential to face the challenges of the 21st-century, and UF is positioning itself to lead in meeting this global societal need. In designing the AI Across the Curriculum model, all students are provided with a suite of AI opportunities and are encouraged to engage. The university is taking advantage of a significant investment in AI campus-wide to innovate curriculum and create activities that nurture interdisciplinary engagement while ensuring student career readiness. As businesses, industry, and governments transform globally within this AI paradigm shift, AI education, innovation, and literacy will become cornerstones of curriculum with UF providing an inclusive example for all undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. While the AI effort at UF is inclusive and broad, the focus of this paper is on undergraduate programs which also represents a Quality Enhancement Plan (or QEP) effort for reaccreditation of UF's undergraduate programs. This program is highly innovative and transformative, creating interdisciplinary AI literacy opportunity for all students.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years there has been increased use of machine learning (ML) techniques within mathematics, including symbolic computation where it may be applied safely to optimise or select algorithms. This paper explores whether using explainable AI (XAI) techniques on such ML models can offer new insight for symbolic computation, inspiring new implementations within computer algebra systems that do not directly call upon AI tools. We present a case study on the use of ML to select the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition. It has already been demonstrated that ML can make the choice well, but here we show how the SHAP tool for explainability can be used to inform new heuristics of a size and complexity similar to those human-designed heuristics currently commonly used in symbolic computation.",

Metabolomics and AI-based models, including explainable AI (XAI), play crucial roles in understanding IBD. Using datasets from the UK Biobank and the Human Microbiome Project Phase II IBD Multiâomics Database (HMP2 IBDMDB), this study uses multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based XAI to prioritize plasma and fecal metabolites and analyze their diet correlations. Key findings include the identification of discriminative metabolites like glycoprotein acetyl and albumin in plasma, as well as nicotinic acid metabolites andurobilin in feces. Fecal metabolites provided a more robust disease predictor model (AUC [95%]: 0.93 [0.87â0.99]) compared to plasma metabolites (AUC [95%]: 0.74 [0.69â0.79]), with stronger and more group-differential diet-metabolite associations in feces. The study validates known metabolite associations and highlights the impact of IBD on the interplay between gut microbial metabolites and diet.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (203KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Although underutilized, extracellular matrix (ECM) components offer significant diagnostic potential. This study evaluates ECM-related markers in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients across varying fibrosis stages.\nMethods\nSixty-eight patients with mild-to-moderate fibrosis (F1-F2), sixty-six with advanced fibrosis (F3-F4), and thirty healthy donors were recruited. Inclusion criteria were detectable HCV-RNA and no other liver diseases or co-infections. Levels of ECM markersâhyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen-III N-peptide (PIIIP N-P), collagen-IV (C-IV)âalong with cholylglycine (CG) and Golgi protein-73 (GP73), were measured in serum using the MAGLUMI 800 CLIA platform.\nResults\nLevels of LN, HA, C-IV, PIIIP N-P (pâ¯<â¯0.001), and GP73 (pâ¯<â¯0.01) increased from controls to F1-F2 and F3-F4. CG levels were higher in pathological subjects compared to controls (pâ¯<â¯0.001), but no significant differences emerged between fibrosis stages. These trends persisted after adjusting for age and sex. A multivariate ordinal regression identified LN, PIIIP N-P, and C-IV as promising markers, with an accuracy of 0.77. An XGBoost model improved accuracy to 0.87 and enhanced other metrics. SHAP analysis confirmed these variables as key contributors to the modelâs predictions.\nConclusion\nThis study underscores the potential of ECM biomarkers, particularly LN, PIIIP N-P, and C-IV, in non-invasively staging CLD. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that a machine learning approach, combined with explainable AI, could further enhance diagnostic accuracy, potentially reducing the need for invasive biopsies.",

This paper investigates how image data capturing visual features of properties could enhance valuation accuracy using the data of actual sales of 34,399 properties from 2018 to 2020 across 128 urban suburbs in Brisbane, the third largest city in Australia. We develop a convolutional neural network model to extract visual features from large-scale data of 320,000 street-view and aerial-view images. We develop fusion models to integrate these additional visual features in HPMs. Using several experimental designs, our preferred fusion models generate a reduction of 28.35% in root-mean-square errors. Less predictive errors of AI-enabled AVMs through the use of visual data would enhance business confidence for AVMsâ end-users for investment, reporting, risk management, tax estimation, and urban planning purposes.",

To address this issue, this study aimed to explore South Korean elementary school teachers' experiences teaching AI curricula and examine their competencies. A survey and interviews were conducted with 67 elementary school teachers who have been working in AI-leading schools in South Korea. The results indicated that teachers were least confident in content knowledge, followed by technological knowledge and pedagogical knowledge relevant to AI. Additionally, interviews with 13 teachers revealed five themes regarding AI education: (1) emphasizing the importance of instructional design in AI education; (2) redesigning the learning environment to promote learning experiences; (3) lowering teaching anxiety by acknowledging the limitations of content knowledge; (4) extending AI education based on computer science (CS) principles; and (5) acquiring literacy in codes, data, AI technologies, and ethical issues. Based on the findings, 22 AI competencies for elementary school teachers were derived and categorized based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. The competencies provide a practical framework for teachers to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for AI education. The study contributes to understanding AI teaching practices in South Korea by revealing teachersâ perspectives on and identifying the essential competencies for practicing AI education.",

Academics have analysed the (largely utopian) corporate visions concerning AI but how governments construe sociotechnical imaginaries of AI has remained understudied. In this paper, we critically analyse how governments articulate sociotechnical imaginaries of AI in Dutch healthcare. We build a theoretical framework for studying these sociotechnical imaginaries, in which we emphasize a) imaginaries of AI and healthcare services b) their performativity and c) the socio-political context in which they are articulated. Backed by a critical multimodal discourse analysis of the Dutch policy programme âValuable AIâ, we identify three tactics for imagining the future of AI and healthcare services, i.e., tactics of 1) legitimation, 2) promotion and 3) reassurance. Each of these tactics âvisualizesâ algorithmization and aims to evoke affective meanings concerning âthe futureâ of AI in healthcare. Our analysis highlights several underlying frictions and tension between the different governmental tactics. This leads to democratic, political, and professional risks. We conclude that explicit attention for these risks, which are now smoothened out in attractive sociotechnical imaginaries, is needed to open up debate and eventually realize democratic, balanced, and fair algorithmic futures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIncreasing awareness of the harms that artificial intelligence (AI) systems can cause has inspired a movement towards creating more human-centered AI (HCAI). One way in which AI systems can be made more human-centered is by focusing on the effects they have on people's needs. However, existing theories of technology impact in HCAI drawn from human-computer interaction (HCI) and related fields such as psychology are not able to account for the ways in which both needs and the impact of technology on these are dynamically shaped by the social context. To address this limitation, in this paper we outline a Social Self-Determination Model (SSDM) of AI system impact. SSDM proposes that people's needs for self-determination can be individual or collective in a particular context depending on features of the person and their environment. Accordingly, because AI systems treat people differently depending on the groups they belong to, they can make needs for individual or collective self-determination psychologically relevant and either fulfill or hamper these. SSDM can be used to help designers and developers create more human-centered AI systems by quantifying the effects of these systems and the social environment in which they are embedded on people's fundamental psychological needs and wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nResponsible integration of conversational agents (CAs) like chatbots is crucial for service firms to mitigate risks and foster positive outcomes. This article provides managerial guidelines through a Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR) lens, focusing on CDR Culture, Management Structure, and Digital Governance across the service firm, software provider, and customers/society. It examines how organizational sensemaking processes of creation, interpretation, and enactment are triggered by CA-related issues and events. The research highlights the role of generative AI (GenAI) in implementing CDR factors and responsible CA software development lifecycle phases during development and integration. Guidelines are provided for leveraging GenAI to enhance CDR Culture, incorporate ethical considerations into CDR Management Structure, and enable robust Digital Governance mechanisms to prioritize customer/societal well-being. A multilevel framework illustrates reinforcing the guidelines through organizational sensemaking processes, and fostering responsible CA integration aligned with ethical principles and societal values.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, global events have posed significant challenges to manufacturing firmsâ business models, necessitating adaptable production systems that integrate human and automated resources seamlessly. Fortunately, technological advancements over the past decade have facilitated flexible production solutions. This paper introduces the approach of the CONVERGING EU project for collaborative smart manufacturing systems aiming at increasing flexibility, efficiency, and operatorsâ satisfaction. The proposed approach is structured into three technical pillars: perception, adaptation, collaboration, enhanced by modules for fostering user experience. Perception involves identifying and recognizing features of parts, resources, and surroundings to infer and analyse their status, and formulate action plans. Automated adaptations through hardware and control system modifications allow for executing formulated plans while complying with user characteristics and needs. Collaboration focuses on the software and hardware interfaces to ensure safe and seamless interaction with collaborative robotic solutions. Training, ergonomics tracking, and adaptable interfaces are also proposed to pave the way toward social industrial environments. This approach is applied to four industrial scenarios from different manufacturing sectors: automotive, white goods, aeronautics and additive manufacturing. The design of systems incorporating AI and robotics is presented together with the expected impact including safer, more intuitive, and trustful human-robot interaction, but also more inclusive industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLife satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog, complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models (LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. The best performing Machine Learning model trained in this study is deployed on a public server, ensuring unrestricted usage of the model. We highlight the advantages of machine learning methods for predicting life satisfaction and the significance of XAI for interpreting and validating these predictions. This study demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.",

Patients had a baseline appointment, followed by a minimum of two appointments with the CDSS. Study exit questionnaires and interviews were conducted to assess perceived clinical utility, impact on patient-physician relationship, and understanding and trust. 7 physicians and 17 patients, of which 14 completed, consented to participate.\nResults\n86 % of physicians (6/7) felt the information provided by the CDSS provided more comprehensive understanding of patient situations. 71 % (5/7) felt the information was helpful. 86 % of physicians (6/7) reported the AI/predictive model was useful when deciding treatment. 62 % of patients (8/13) reported improved care due to the tool, and 46 %(6/13) reported a significantly or somewhat improved physician-patient relationship 54 % reported no change. 71 % of physicians (5/7) and 62 % of patients (8/13) rated trusting the tool.\nLimitations\nSmall sample size and treatment changes prior to CDSS introduction limits ability to verify impact on outcomes.\nConclusions\nQualitative results from 12 patient exit interviews are analyzed and presented. Findings suggest physicians perceived the tool as useful in conducting appointments and used it while deciding treatment. Physicians and patients generally found the tool trustworthy, and it may have positive effects on physician-patient relationships. (Study identifier: NCT04061642).",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article investigates the potential applications and strategic implications of integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) within manual assembly. With the widespread adoption of AI technologies in different sectors, there is an increasing interest in employing GenAI in manufacturing. Looking ahead, GenAI is poised to play an increasingly pivotal role, particularly in reshaping manufacturing paradigms, as we move towards a future marked by Industry 5.0âs emphasis on human-centered approaches and intelligent automation. Despite the rising importance, research on the application of GenAI in manual assembly remains limited. However, manual assembly presents numerous opportunities for potential utilization. This paper aims to examine the diverse roles of GenAI in supporting manual assembly processes by examining various scenarios where it could be beneficial and discussing strategic considerations. Additionally, it strives to point out the significance of GenAI in the context of Industry 5.0, emphasizing its focus on human-centered approaches. First, the fundamental principles of GenAI are examined, highlighting its ability to generate outputs independently using input data and predefined parameters. Comprehensive research into the state of the art is carried out then, with the aim of identifying possible existing approaches for the use of GenAI in manual assembly as well as other possible applications that can be adapted and transferred. Subsequently, an initial conceptual approach for possible applications of GenAI in manual assembly is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe worldwide prevalence of thyroid disease is on the rise, representing a chronic condition that significantly impacts global mortality rates. Machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated potential superiority in mitigating the occurrence of this disease by facilitating early detection and treatment. However, there is a growing demand among stakeholders and patients for reliable and credible explanations of the generated predictions in sensitive medical domains. Hence, we propose an interpretable thyroid classification model to illustrate outcome explanations and investigate the contribution of predictive features by utilizing explainable AI. Two real-time thyroid datasets underwent various preprocessing approaches, addressing data imbalance issues using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTE-ENN). Subsequently, two hybrid classifiers, namely RDKVT and RDKST, were introduced to train the processed and selected features from Univariate and Information Gain feature selection techniques. Following the training phase, the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) was applied to identify the influential characteristics and corresponding values contributing to the outcomes. The conducted experiments ultimately concluded that the presented RDKST classifier achieved the highest performance, demonstrating an accuracy of 98.98 % when trained on Information Gain selected features. Notably, the features T3 (triiodothyronine), TT4 (total thyroxine), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FTI (free thyroxine index), and T3_measured significantly influenced the generated outcomes. By balancing classification accuracy and outcome explanation ability, this study aims to enhance the clinical decision-making process and improve patient care.",

One example is the surge in the adoption of national AI strategies (NASs). NASs have a structuring function, justifying current political decisions as well as (re)framing the conditions of possibility of AI in society. This paper explores the sociotechnical imaginaries (SIs) of AI in health in the NASs of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The findings reveal that a shared common future vision can be identified, though some variations in the justification of how and why this should be realised exist between the states. This common future vision is of the inevitable and ever-increasing scale and scope of AI in health. This is a process driven and implemented by the private sector, a future which is normalised and legitimised through the promise of greater efficiency and progress. However, a tension between the role of states as simply reacting to, as well as being essential facilitators of, the realisation of this shared vision is identified, a tension that results from technological promises.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a type of cancer responsible for higher mortality rates among women. The cruelty of breast cancer always requires a promising approach for its earlier detection. In light of this, the proposed research leverages the representation ability of pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model and the classification ability of the XGBoost model for the binary classification of breast tumors. In addition, the above transfer learning model is modified in such a way that it will focus more on tumor cells in the input mammogram. Accordingly, the work proposed an EfficientNet-B0 having a Spatial Attention Layer with XGBoost (ESA-XGBNet) for binary classification of mammograms. For this, the work is trained, tested, and validated using original and augmented mammogram images of three public datasets namely CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and MIAS databases. Maximum classification accuracy of 97.585% (CBIS-DDSM), 98.255% (INbreast), and 98.91% (MIAS) is obtained using the proposed ESA-XGBNet architecture as compared with the existing models. Furthermore, the decision-making of the proposed ESA-XGBNet architecture is visualized and validated using the Attention Guided GradCAM-based Explainable AI technique.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption and use of AI technologies to support the virtualisation of the workplace. While previous research showed that systemsâ use critically depends on usersâ trust, little is known about the development of trust in AI technologies. This research focuses on an AI chatbot as a type of organisational AI system and asks how and why employeesâ trust towards an AI chatbot is formed and sustained. To answer the research questions, we conducted an interpretive single case study of a global organisation. The study identifies three types of trust experienced by AI chatbot users â emotional, cognitive and organisational â and develops a framework of experiential and sustained trust formation. It contributes to the information systems literature by demonstrating the critical importance of emotional and organisational trust in complementing cognitive trust, as well as the key design features that promote trust in AI chatbot use.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI), conceived in the 1950s, has permeated numerous industries, intensifying in tandem with advancements in computing power. Despite the widespread adoption of AI, its integration into medicine trails other sectors. However, medical AI research has experienced substantial growth, attracting considerable attention from researchers and practitioners.\nObjective\nIn the absence of an existing framework, this study aims to outline the current landscape of medical AI research and provide insights into its future developments by examining all AI-related studies within PubMed over the past 2 decades. We also propose potential data acquisition and analysis methods, developed using Python (version 3.11) and to be executed in Spyder IDE (version 5.4.3), for future analogous research.\nMethods\nOur dual-pronged approach involved (1) retrieving publication metadata related to AI from PubMed (spanning 2000-2022) via Python, including titles, abstracts, authors, journals, country, and publishing years, followed by keyword frequency analysis and (2) classifying relevant topics using latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach, and defining the research scope of AI in medicine. In the absence of a universal medical AI taxonomy, we used an AI dictionary based on the European Commission Joint Research Centre AI Watch report, which emphasizes 8 domains: reasoning, planning, learning, perception, communication, integration and interaction, service, and AI ethics and philosophy.\nResults\nFrom 2000 to 2022, a comprehensive analysis of 307,701 AI-related publications from PubMed highlighted a 36-fold increase. The United States emerged as a clear frontrunner, producing 68,502 of these articles. Despite its substantial contribution in terms of volume, China lagged in terms of citation impact. Diving into specific AI domains, as the Joint Research Centre AI Watch report categorized, the learning domain emerged dominant. Our classification analysis meticulously traced the nuanced research trajectories across each domain, revealing the multifaceted and evolving nature of AIâs application in the realm of medicine.\nConclusions\nThe research topics have evolved as the volume of AI studies increases annually. Machine learning remains central to medical AI research, with deep learning expected to maintain its fundamental role. Empowered by predictive algorithms, pattern recognition, and imaging analysis capabilities, the future of AI research in medicine is anticipated to concentrate on medical diagnosis, robotic intervention, and disease management. Our topic modeling outcomes provide a clear insight into the focus of AI research in medicine over the past decades and lay the groundwork for predicting future directions. The domains that have attracted considerable research attention, primarily the learning domain, will continue to shape the trajectory of AI in medicine. Given the observed growing interest, the domain of AI ethics and philosophy also stands out as a prospective area of increased focus.",

However, honeybees are being threatened by highly effective pesticides such as neonicotinoids, which can have detrimental impacts on honeybee foraging in particular. In a colony, nectar and pollen foragers play distinct roles in sustaining the colony. Despite evidence of sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees, little is known about how neonicotinoids affect the foraging behaviour of an entire colony. Here, we conducted a field study using our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated monitoring technology to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field-realistic sub-lethal doses on colony foraging behaviour. A mechanistic simulation model (BEEHAVE) was then used to reproduce and interpret field observations, and further identify the plausible mechanisms underlying the empirical findings. Surprisingly, the field study revealed that imidacloprid greatly reduced pollen foraging but not nectar foraging. In addition, no lethal effects on honeybees were observed. The simulations showed that the time spent by pollen foragers on completing their foraging trips was significantly increased, which subsequently decreased the number of pollen foraging trips per day, thereby reducing pollen foraging at the colony level. This suggests that pollen and nectar foraging may require different energetic costs, cognitive functions, and/or gene expressions, which implies different susceptibilities of pollen and nectar foragers to chemical stressors. As pollen foraging is essential for brood rearing, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids, together with other stressors, may affect colony survival and resilience more than previously thought.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (134KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nExisting research in identifying changes in public sentiment for major events faces limitations in capturing the intricacies of temporal changes, especially with large-scale data and diverse linguistic nuances. This study addresses this problem, with a particular focus on the globally acclaimed Dubai Expo 2020. The methodology employed in this research introduces a groundbreaking approach by leveraging advanced data engineering techniques on a massive corpus of 118,025 Tweets obtained from diverse users across 60 languages, covering the period from April 2021 to March 2023. The study pioneers the application of artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis and topic modeling on Twitter discourse. Through the meticulous data engineering process, including language detection, dynamic translation, and sentiment analysis, the research identifies subtle yet statistically significant changes in public sentiment, as evidenced by ANOVA testing (p=0.018 in average positive sentiment, p=0.004 in average neutral sentiment, and p=0.005 in average negative sentiments). Additionally, the study innovatively extracts and analyzes support-related Tweets, revealing distinct phases in temporal domains (pre-Expo, Expo, Post-Expo1, and Post-Expo2) and yielding 11,116 support-related tweets. The application of NLP techniques further uncovers 19 topics from UAE-related Tweets, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic landscape of public sentiment over a two-year period. This research contributes significantly to the field by offering a novel and comprehensive framework for analyzing public sentiment, particularly in the context of major events, and sheds light on its broader implications for event management and public perception analysis.",

This paper explores the nexus of data-AI-governance in MaaS to understand in how far sustainability is addressed. While the role of data and AI is covered by technical literature, and governance by social science literature, these discussions remain largely separate in MaaS. This paper aims to redress this issue through an interdisciplinary narrative literature review that brings together these literature sets. The research question is: How does the data-AI-governance nexus in MaaS give rise to hybrid forms of governance between humans and algorithms and what are the implications for sustainable mobility? Results show that: (1) The data collection and processing that is crucial to MaaS, might reproduce socio-political inequalities. (2) AI-driven customisation and nudging of end-user demand ignores rebound effects, that can only be avoided if sustainability objectives are central. (3) Inadequate integration of mobility service supply might exacerbate mobility challenges. (4) When mobility system optimisation through AI becomes more widespread, MaaS platforms might become a form of algorithmic governance. (5) Whether sustainability can be reached, depends on how and by whom (sustainability) objectives of algorithms will be decided. The paper concludes that hybrid governance for sustainability requires close collaboration between policymakers and industry players and acknowledging AI algorithms as important non-human actors. The paper contributes to conceptual debates on sustainability and data/AI, governance and data/AI in MaaS and beyond, and to policymaking on aligning platform systems with sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn manufacturing, traditional robotic programming methodologies have often been focused on independent operation, offering limited capabilities for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper introduces a paradigm shift in collaborative production systems by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs). Contrary to traditional methods that rely on pre-defined assembly instructions, this paper introduces a novel framework employing primitive knowledge of the production process, including product design and required assembly steps. By integrating LLMs and a behavior tree-based system control, this approach enables programmers to rapidly deploy collaborative assembly procedures by expediting the programming of robotic operations. The system also incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, which facilitate real-time alterations in assembly steps, leading to reduced overall production time. The frameworkâs behavior tree-based control architecture allows for dynamic adaptability, offering optimized solutions across a range of assembly scenarios. The results of the frameworkâs deployment suggest that this innovative programming paradigm significantly enhances both the adaptability and efficiency of collaborative manufacturing settings.",

While the full structure-mechanics relationship of highly ordered material distributions can be studied with finite number of cases, this relationship is difficult to be revealed for complex irregular distributions, preventing design of such material structures to meet certain mechanical requirements. The noticeable developments of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in material design enables to detect the hidden structure-mechanics correlations which is essential for designing composite of complex structures. It is intriguing how these tools can assist composite design. Here, we focus on the rapid generation of bicontinuous composite structures together with the stress distribution in loading. We find that generative AI, enabled through fine-tuned Low Rank Adaptation models, can be trained with a few inputs to generate both synthetic composite structures and the corresponding von Mises stress distribution. The results show that this technique is convenient in generating massive composites designs with useful mechanical information that dictate stiffness, fracture and robustness of the material with one model, and such has to be done by several different experimental or simulation tests. This research offers valuable insights for the improvement of composite design with the goal of expanding the design space and automatic screening of composite designs for improved mechanical functions.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (334KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The world has become more digitally connected than ever, but we face major challenges. One of the most significant is cybercrime, which has emerged as a global threat to governments, businesses, and civil societies. The pervasiveness of digital technologies combined with a constantly shifting technological foundation has created a complex and powerful playground for cybercriminals, which triggered a surge in demand for intelligent threat detection systems based on machine and deep learning. This paper investigates AI-based cyber threat detection to protect our modern digital ecosystems. The primary focus is on evaluating ML-based classifiers and ensembles for anomaly-based malware detection and network intrusion detection and how to integrate those models in the context of network security, mobile security, and IoT security. The discussion highlights the challenges when deploying and integrating AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions into existing enterprise systems and IT infrastructures, including options to overcome those challenges. Finally, the paper provides future research directions to further increase the security and resilience of our modern digital industries, infrastructures, and ecosystems.",

Traditionally, researchers self-managed their workflows in a manual and tedious way that heavily relies on their memory. Due to the complexity and unpredictability of AI models, they often struggled to track and manage all the data, steps, and history of the workflow. AI workflows are time-consuming, redundant, and error-prone, especially when big data is involved. A common strategy to make these workflows more manageable is to use a workflow management system, and we recommend Geoweaver, an open-source workflow management system that enables users to create, modify and reuse AI workflows all in one place. To make our work in Geoweaver reusable by the other workflow management systems, we created an add-on functionality geoweaver_cwl, a Python package that automatically converts Geoweaver AI workflows into the Common Workflow Language (CWL) format. It will allow researchers to easily share, exchange, modify, reuse, and build a new workflow from existing ones in other CWL-compliant software. A user study was conducted with the existing workflows created by Geoweaver to collect suggestions and fill in the gaps between our package and Geoweaver. The evaluation confirms that geoweaver_cwl can lead to a well-versed AI process while disclosing opportunities for further extensions. The geoweaver_cwl package is publicly released online at https://pypi.org/project/geoweaver-cwl/0.0.1/.",

Machine learning methods have shown promising results for several psychological conditions. However, the lack of transparency in existing models impedes practical application. The study aims to develop explainable machine learning models for depression, anxiety and stress prediction, focusing on features extracted from tasks involving handwriting and drawing.\nTwo hundred patients completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and performed seven tasks related to handwriting and drawing. Extracted features, encompassing pressure, stroke pattern, time, space, and pen inclination, were used to train the explainable-by-design Entropy-based Logic Explained Network (e-LEN) model, employing first-order logic rules for explanation. Performance comparison was performed with XGBoost, enhanced by the SHAP explanation method.\nThe trained models achieved notable accuracy in predicting depression (0.749 Â±0.089), anxiety (0.721 Â±0.088), and stress (0.761 Â±0.086) through 10-fold cross-validation (repeated 20 times). The e-LEN modelâs logic rules facilitated clinical validation, uncovering correlations with existing clinical literature. While performance remained consistent for depression and anxiety on an independent test dataset, a slight degradation was observed for stress prediction in the test task.",

Focusing on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), the research highlights WPT's significant contributions to sustainability across economic, environmental, and social realms. Utilizing Biblioshiny and VOSviewer, we extract and visualize key insights into WPT's recent progress, technological applications, top keywords, publication trends, geographical distribution, and thematic clusters. Our findings indicate a strong emphasis on sustainable energy solutions, with 1589 publications directly related to SDG 7. WPT also supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) with 56 publications and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) with 171 publications, contributing to resilient infrastructure and sustainable urban development. Moreover, the study uncovers WPT's potential in environmental conservation, with notable attention to SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with WPT is emphasized for enhancing efficiency and broad application in areas such as affordable energy, agricultural yields, health standards, digital education, and water purification. Despite challenges like financial constraints, technical hurdles, and environmental concerns, the paper suggests innovative solutions through funding, research, environmental assessments, and collaborative policymaking. Highlighting the promise of state-of-the-art WPT techniques, this analysis advocates for democratizing technology access in marginalized regions, presenting WPT as a pivotal tool for a sustainable, equitable future aligned with the SDGs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe quest for trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly urgent, especially in the field of next-generation wireless networks. Future Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks will connect a huge amount of devices and will offer innovative services empowered with AI and Machine Learning tools. Nevertheless, private user data, which are essential for training such services, are not an asset that can be unrestrictedly shared over the network, mainly because of privacy concerns. To overcome this issue, Federated Learning (FL) has recently been proposed as a paradigm to enable collaborative model training among multiple parties, without any disclosure of private raw data. However, the initiative to natively integrate FL services into mobile networks is still far from being accomplished. In this paper we propose a novel FL-as-a-Service framework that provides the B5G/6G network with flexible mechanisms to allow end users to exploit FL services, and we describe its applicability to a Quality of Experience (QoE) forecasting service based on a vehicular networking use case. Specifically, we show how FL of eXplainable AI (XAI) models can be leveraged for the QoE forecasting task, and induces a benefit in terms of both accuracy, compared to local learning, and trustworthiness, thanks to the adoption of inherently interpretable models. Such considerations are supported by an extensive experimental analysis on a publicly available simulated dataset. Finally, we assessed how the learning process is affected by the system deployment and the performance of the underlying communication and computation infrastructure, through system-level simulations, which show the benefits of deploying the proposed framework in edge-based environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFor increasingly complex communication demands of large-scale AI communication systems, the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) better caters to demands but also raises concerns about resource scarcity and diversity. This paper innovatively combines Graph Pointer Neural Networks (GPNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance resource allocation efficiency. The method leverages the advantages of GPNN in handling graph data and RL in optimizing decisions in dynamic environments. It also targets the optimization goal of maximizing resource allocation while minimizing deployment latency. This paper begins by modeling SAGIN and elucidating the SAGIN logical architecture based on Software-defined Networking (SDN). Subsequently, it introduces an SFC deployment algorithm aimed at joint optimization of resource allocation and latency. The algorithm leverages GPNN and RL to deploy virtual nodes and links, with the goal of optimizing resource allocation and deployment latency. Experiment findings conclusively demonstrate that the efficacy of proposed algorithm in effectively weighing limited heterogeneous resources and minimum mapping delay. Notably, when compared to three other SFC mapping algorithms MLRL, NFVdeep, and RL, the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms them, with an average improvement of 10.17% in long-term average reward/cost, 11.21% in link resource utilization ratio, 15.34% in node resource utilization ratio, and 16.38% in acceptance ratio.",

It seems reasonable to assume that these applications would enhance student experiences and course satisfaction, and that therefore educational institutions should invest in these technologies to enhance their student offer. However, this should be tested empirically. In the current study a gender-balanced sample of 302 UK students rated course satisfaction, completed the General Attitudes towards AI Scale (GAAIS), comfortableness with AI educational applications, and course satisfaction if AI educational applications were adopted. Although students were, on average, moderately comfortable with AI educational applications, course satisfaction dropped in response to their hypothetical adoption. AI applications that assigned summative grades or that offered wellbeing support gave rise to the highest levels of discomfort. Students were more comfortable with career support, formative course support, and administrative support. Positive and Negative AI attitudes predicted the satisfaction difference, with mediation via comfortableness with applications. We recommend that Higher Education Institutions exercise caution before making major investments in AI educational applications.",

The inventive conversational ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc), offers a potential means for patients to effectively locate answers to their health-related questions digitally.\nObjective\nA pilot study was conducted to compare the novel ChatGPT with the existing Google Search technology for their ability to offer accurate, effective, and current information regarding proceeding action after missing a dose of oral contraceptive pill.\nMethods\nA sequence of 11 questions, mimicking a patient inquiring about the action to take after missing a dose of an oral contraceptive pill, were input into ChatGPT as a cascade, given the conversational ability of ChatGPT. The questions were input into 4 different ChatGPT accounts, with the account holders being of various demographics, to evaluate potential differences and biases in the responses given to different account holders. The leading question, âwhat should I do if I missed a day of my oral contraception birth control?â alone was then input into Google Search, given its nonconversational nature. The results from the ChatGPT questions and the Google Search results for the leading question were evaluated on their readability, accuracy, and effective delivery of information.\nResults\nThe ChatGPT results were determined to be at an overall higher-grade reading level, with a longer reading duration, less accurate, less current, and with a less effective delivery of information. In contrast, the Google Search resulting answer box and snippets were at a lower-grade reading level, shorter reading duration, more current, able to reference the origin of the information (transparent), and provided the information in various formats in addition to text.\nConclusions\nChatGPT has room for improvement in accuracy, transparency, recency, and reliability before it can equitably be implemented into health care information delivery and provide the potential benefits it poses. However, AI may be used as a tool for providers to educate their patients in preferred, creative, and efficient ways, such as using AI to generate accessible short educational videos from health care provider-vetted information.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNatural language processing, with parsing and generation, has a long tradition. Parsing has been easier to perform than a generation but with generative artificial intelligence (a.k.a Gen AI) and large language models (abbr. LLMs), this has changed. Generative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a large data set to create something in the genre of that data set. It can generate different outputs ranging from texts, audio, objects, pictures, and paintings to videos, but also synthetic data. LLMs use deep learning and deep neural networks to train on large text corpora for recognizing and generating texts. These models are based on massive data sets, collected from databases and the web. They use transformer models to detect how elements in sequences relate to each other. This provides context support. Two well-known large language models are the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, GPT, used in ChatGPT and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, BERT. Although LLMs have advantages, they have problems. This paper presents generative artificial intelligence and LLMs with benefits and drawbacks. Results from applying these models have shown that they can work well for accuracy in specificity, user personalization and human-computer communication but they may not provide acceptable, reliable and truthful results. For example, ethics, hallucinations and incorrect information, or misjudgments, are some major problems. The paper ends with future directions, research questions on LLMs, and recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Background\nPrimary care physicians (PCPs) are often limited in their ability to collect detailed medical histories from patients, which can lead to errors or delays in diagnosis. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show promise in augmenting current human-driven methods of collecting personal and family histories; however, such tools are largely unproven.\nObjective\nThe main aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a conversational AI medical interviewing system among patients.\nMethods\nThe study was conducted among adult patients empaneled at a family medicine clinic within a large academic medical center in Northern California. Participants were asked to test an AI medical interviewing system, which uses a conversational avatar and chatbot to capture medical histories and identify patients with risk factors. After completing an interview with the AI system, participants completed a web-based survey inquiring about the performance of the system, the ease of using the system, and attitudes toward the system. Responses on a 7-point Likert scale were collected and evaluated using descriptive statistics.\nResults\nA total of 20 patients with a mean age of 50 years completed an interview with the AI system, including 12 females (60%) and 8 males (40%); 11 were White (55%), 8 were Asian (40%), and 1 was Black (5%), and 19 had at least a bachelorâs degree (95%). Most participants agreed that using the system to collect histories could help their PCPs have a better understanding of their health (16/20, 80%) and help them stay healthy through identification of their health risks (14/20, 70%). Those who reported that the system was clear and understandable, and that they were able to learn it quickly, tended to be younger; those who reported that the tool could motivate them to share more comprehensive histories with their PCPs tended to be older.\nConclusions\nIn this feasibility and acceptability pilot of a conversational AI medical interviewing system, the majority of patients believed that it could help clinicians better understand their health and identify health risks; however, patients were split on the effort required to use the system, and whether AI should be used for medical interviewing. Our findings suggest areas for further research, such as understanding the user interface factors that influence ease of use and adoption, and the reasons behind patientsâ attitudes toward AI-assisted history-taking.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nGenerative AI can enhance productivity but may also lead to replacement of human employees.\nâ¢\nTeaching, learning, and academic research will experience some of the most transformative impacts.\nâ¢\nBiases, out of date training data, and lack of transparency and credibility are major concerns.\nâ¢\nThe effects of generative AI on knowledge acquisition and digital transformation need research.\nâ¢\nIt is critical to identify and implement policies to protect against misuse and abuse of generative AI.\nAbstract\nTransformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPTâs capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPTâs use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.",

However, when considering recommendations from modern âblack boxâ intelligent systems, users are confronted with the decision of accepting or overriding AIâs recommendations. These decisions are even more challenging to make when there exists a significant knowledge imbalance between the users and the AI systemânamely, when people lack necessary task knowledge and are therefore unable to accurately complete the task on their own. In this work, we aim to understand peopleâs behavior in AI-assisted decision-making tasks when faced with the challenge of knowledge imbalance and explore whether involving users in an AIâs prediction generation process makes them more willing to follow the AIâs recommendations and enhances their perception of collaboration. Our empirical study reveals that the involvement of users in generating AI recommendations during a task with notable knowledge imbalance causes them to be more willing to agree with the AIâs suggestions and to perceive the AI agent and their collaboration as a team more positively.",

An AI-based imaging system, which utilises a rigid endoscope, was tested for the real-time particle size measurement of solid NaCl powder used as a model API in the range of 200â1000 Âµm. After creating a dataset containing annotated images of NaCl particles, it was used to train an AI model for detecting particles and measuring their size. The developed system could analyse overlapping particles without dispersing air, thus broadening its applicability. The performance of the system was evaluated by measuring pre-sifted NaCl samples with the imaging tool, after which it was installed into a continuous mill for in-line particle size measurement of a milling process. By analysing â¼100 particles/s, the system was able to accurately measure the particle size of sifted NaCl samples and detect particle size reduction when applied in the milling process. The Dv50 values and PSDs measured real-time with the AI-based system correlated well with the reference laser diffraction measurements (<6% mean absolute difference over the measured samples). The AI-based imaging system shows great potential for in-line particle size analysis, which, in line with the latest pharmaceutical QC trends, can provide valuable information for process development and control.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (138KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Post-surgery incontinence is a significant concern, with prevalence rates ranging from 25 to 45% for urinary incontinence and 9â68% for fecal incontinence. Cancer survivors are increasingly turning to YouTube as a platform to connect with others, yet caution is warranted as misinformation is prevalent.\nObjective\nThis study aims to evaluate the information quality in YouTube videos about post-surgical incontinence after pelvic area cancer surgery.\nMethods\nA YouTube search for \"Incontinence after cancer surgery\" yielded 108 videos, which were subsequently analyzed. To evaluate these videos, several quality assessment tools were utilized, including DISCERN, GQS, JAMA, PEMAT, and MQ-VET. Statistical analyses, such as descriptive statistics and intercorrelation tests, were employed to assess various video attributes, including characteristics, popularity, educational value, quality, and reliability. Also, artificial intelligence techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP were used for data analysis. HeatMap and Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram techniques validated the Machine Learning results.\nResults\nThe quality scales presented a high level of correlation one with each other (p < 0.01) and the Artificial Intelligence-based techniques presented clear clustering representations of the dataset samples, which were reinforced by the Heat Map and Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram.\nConclusions\nYouTube videos on \"Incontinence after Cancer Surgery\" present a \"High\" quality across multiple scales. The use of AI tools, like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, is highlighted for clustering large health datasets, improving data visualization, pattern recognition, and complex healthcare analysis.",

While there were other studies to predict NH3 and its source apportionment, this manuscript provides a novel method (i.e., GEO-AI)) to look into NH3 predictions and their contribution sources. This study represents a pioneering effort in the application of a novel geospatial-artificial intelligence (Geo-AI) base model with parcel tracking functions. This innovative approach seamlessly integrates various machine learning algorithms and geographic predictor variables to estimate NH3 concentrations, marking the first instance of such a comprehensive methodology. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used to further analyze source contribution of NH3 with domain knowledge. From 2016 to 2018, Taichung's hourly average NH3 values were predicted with total variance up to 96%. SHAP values revealed that waterbody, traffic and agriculture emissions were the most significant factors to affect NH3 concentrations in Taichung among all the characteristics. Our methodology is a vital first step for shaping future policies and regulations and is adaptable to regions with limited monitoring sites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n3D microstructures provide valuable insight into material behavior which is essential in elucidating microstructural phenomena, such as particle morphology and void damage, and consequent macroscopic material response. However, creating 3D microstructures is extremely laborious and expensive, requiring complex microstructural characterization and imaging techniques such as Focussed-Ion Beam based Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) or X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT). To this end, synthetic 3D microstructures were rapidly generated from orthogonal 2D images using SliceGAN, which proved a practical and cost-effective method. In this study, multiple synthetic microstructures of AA7075-O, a complex microstructure of various strengthening precipitates within a softer aluminum matrix, were post-processed, meshed, and modeled for different damage behavior in FEA using advanced constitutive material models. Subsequently, the synthetic and real microstructures were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed for their elastoplastic deformation and ductile void damage responses.\nThis study illustrates the viability of an integrated AI-FE methodology in studying microstructural micromechanics, demonstrating that synthetic microstructures exhibited a very similar stress-strain response, especially when using a free boundary condition, and comparable stress distribution and void damage, albeit with some discrepancies. Also, it emphasizes the influence of particle morphology on strength and damage, where highly irregular particles play a dual role in increasing strain hardening by restricting matrix flow at the cost of increased ductile damage induced by decohered particles. Lastly, the more advanced FE models, with multiple voiding mechanisms, reduced the discrepancy between real and synthetic microstructures compared to simpler models\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (348KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

The detection of AI-generated text has become a subject of great debate considering the AI text detectorâs known and unexpected limitations. Thus far, much research in this area has focused on the detection of AI-generated text; however, the goal of this study was to evaluate the opposite scenario, an AI-text detection tool's ability to discriminate human-generated text. Thousands of abstracts from several of the most well-known scientific journals were used to test the predictive capabilities of these detection tools, assessing abstracts from 1980 to 2023. We found that the AI text detector erroneously identified up to 8% of the known real abstracts as AI-generated text. This further highlights the current limitations of such detection tools and argues for novel detectors or combined approaches that can address this shortcoming and minimize its unanticipated consequences as we navigate this new AI landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFood waste is a critical global issue, with approximately one-third of produced food being wasted annually. Indonesia, contributing around 20.93 million tonnes to this waste, faces several economic and environmental impacts. The primary causes of food waste in Indonesian households include a lack of knowledge about food storage and expiration dates, along with the unreliability of traditional freshness assessment methods. This research will evaluate three pre-trained AI models â MobileNetV2, VGG19, and EfficientNetV2S â using the âFresh and Rotten Classificationâ dataset from Kaggle, which contains 30.4k images depicting both fresh and rotten produce, in hopes to extend this research to integrate these models to AI-based tools to recognize spoilage in produce, thereby reducing household food waste. EfficientNetV2S emerged as the most effective model, achieving a 97.61% accuracy and a 97.59% F1-score, indicating robust performance and suitability for real-time applications in households. Despite promising results, challenges such as dataset quality and class imbalance were noted. Future research should focus on improving models' performance through hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, and developing comprehensive datasets. Integrating these models into user friendly applications could significantly contribute to reducing food taste and promoting sustainable consumption habits in Indonesia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn AI-empowered indoor digital contact-tracing system was developed using a centralized architecture and advanced low-energy Bluetooth technologies for indoor positioning, with careful preservation of privacy and data security. We analyzed the contact pattern data from two RCHs and investigated a COVID-19 outbreak in one study site. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system in containing outbreaks with minimal contacts under quarantine, a simulation study was conducted to compare the impact of different quarantine strategies on outbreak containment within RCHs. The significant difference in contact hours between weekdays and weekends was observed for some pairs of RCH residents and staff during the two-week data collection period. No significant difference between secondary cases and uninfected contacts was observed in a COVID-19 outbreak in terms of their demographics and contact patterns. Simulation results based on the collected contact data indicated that a threshold of accumulative contact hours one or two days prior to diagnosis of the index case could dramatically increase the efficiency of outbreak containment within RCHs by targeted isolation of the close contacts. This study demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of employing an AI-empowered system in indoor digital contact tracing of outbreaks in RCHs in the post-pandemic era.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is often promoted as a potential solution for many challenges health care systems face worldwide. However, its implementation in clinical practice lags behind its technological development.\nObjective\nThis study aims to gain insights into the current state and prospects of AI technology from the stakeholders most directly involved in its adoption in the health care sector whose perspectives have received limited attention in research to date.\nMethods\nFor this purpose, the perspectives of AI researchers and health care IT professionals in North America and Western Europe were collected and compared for profession-specific and regional differences. In this preregistered, mixed methods, cross-sectional study, 23 experts were interviewed using a semistructured guide. Data from the interviews were analyzed using deductive and inductive qualitative methods for the thematic analysis along with topic modeling to identify latent topics.\nResults\nThrough our thematic analysis, four major categories emerged: (1) the current state of AI systems in health care, (2) the criteria and requirements for implementing AI systems in health care, (3) the challenges in implementing AI systems in health care, and (4) the prospects of the technology. Experts discussed the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems in health care in addition to their prevalence and regional differences. Several criteria and requirements deemed necessary for the successful implementation of AI systems were identified, including the technologyâs performance and security, smooth system integration and human-AI interaction, costs, stakeholder involvement, and employee training. However, regulatory, logistical, and technical issues were identified as the most critical barriers to an effective technology implementation process. In the future, our experts predicted both various threats and many opportunities related to AI technology in the health care sector.\nConclusions\nOur work provides new insights into the current state, criteria, challenges, and outlook for implementing AI technology in health care from the perspective of AI researchers and IT professionals in North America and Western Europe. For the full potential of AI-enabled technologies to be exploited and for them to contribute to solving current health care challenges, critical implementation criteria must be met, and all groups involved in the process must work together.",

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for the survival of the patients. However, the majority of women are diagnosed in advanced stages due to the lack of effective biomarkers and accurate screening tools. While previous studies sought a common biomarker, our study suggests different biomarkers for the premenopausal and postmenopausal populations. This can provide a new perspective in the search for novel predictors for the effective diagnosis of OC. Genetic algorithm has been utilized to identify the most significant biomarkers. The XGBoost classifier is then trained on the selected features and high ROC-AUC scores of 0.864 and 0.911 have been obtained for the premenopausal and postmenopausal populations, respectively. Lack of explainability is one major limitation of current AI systems. The stochastic nature of the ML algorithms raises concerns about the reliability of the system as it is difficult to interpret the reasons behind the decisions. To increase the trustworthiness and accountability of the diagnostic system as well as to provide transparency and explanations behind the predictions, explainable AI has been incorporated into the ML framework. SHAP is employed to quantify the contributions of the selected biomarkers and determine the most discriminative features. Merging SHAP with the ML models enables clinicians to investigate individual decisions made by the model and gain insights into the factors leading to that prediction. Thus, a hybrid decision support system has been established that can eliminate the bottlenecks caused by the black-box nature of the ML algorithms providing a safe and trustworthy AI tool. The diagnostic accuracy obtained from the proposed system outperforms the existing methods as well as the state-of-the-art ROMA algorithm by a substantial margin which signifies its potential to be an effective tool in the differential diagnosis of OC.",

In this study, we collected 10,021 ultrasound images from 8,079 patients across four independent institutions to develop and validate a human understandable AI report system named TiNet for thyroid cancer prediction. TiNet can extract thyroid nodule features such as texture, margin, echogenicity, shape, and location using a deep learning method conforming to the clinical diagnosis standard. Moreover, it offers excellent prediction performance (AUC 0.88) and provides quantitative explanations for the predictions. We conducted a reverse cognitive test in which clinicians matched the correct ultrasound images according to TiNet and clinical reports. The results indicated that TiNet reports (87.1% accuracy) were significantly easier to understand than clinical reports (81.6% accuracy; p < 0.001). TiNet can serve as a bridge between AI-based diagnosis and clinicians, enhancing humanâAI cooperative medical decision-making.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (240KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Isolated drugs and two drugâfullerene complexes (i.e., drugâpristine C60 fullerene and drugâcarboxyfullerene C60âCOOH) were investigated with the protein CXCR7 as the molecular docking target. The research involved over 30 drugs and employed Pearsonâs hardâsoft acidâbase theory and common QSAR/QSPR descriptors to build predictive models for the docking scores. Energetic descriptors were computed using quantum chemistry at the density functional-based tight binding DFTB3 level. The results indicate that drugâfullerene complexes interact more with CXCR7 than isolated drugs. Specific binding sites were identified, with varying locations for each drug complex. Predictive models, developed using multiple linear regression and IBM Watson artificial intelligence (AI), achieved mean absolute percentage errors below 12%, driven by AI-identified key variables. The predictive models included mainly quantitative descriptors collected from datasets as well as computed ones. In addition, a water-soluble fullerene was used to compare results obtained by DFTB3 with a conventional density functional theory approach. These findings promise to enhance breast cancer chemotherapy by leveraging fullerene-based drug nanocarriers.",

This research proposes a new approach to conduct a comprehensive analysis for transforming existing low-voltage networks into MGs to achieve the net-zero goal by 2050. A data-driven machine learning-based clustering and profiling approach is designed and implemented to extract the data, constraints, and dependencies from the historical data. Furthermore, the constraints and dependencies are utilized for determining the renewable energy sourcesâ capacity. A Bi-level optimization technique is developed to ensure appropriate coordination of cost and renewable energy source (RES) capacity. A comprehensive analysis is carried out utilizing real historical demand and generation data of an energy community in Australia. Based on the clustered analysis, the consecutive dayâs data are considered for the analysis. The findings reveal that the proposed microgrids achieve higher renewable RES utilization and lower electricity costs compared to grid-connected systems, with the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 98.23% when transitioning from coal-based grid systems to the proposed microgrid system. Additionally, a transformation from a grid time-of-use tariff-based system to the proposed microgrid setup can lead to a cost reduction of 65.45%. These case studies will also assist the researcher in identifying new, potential ideas and industries to accelerate the implementation of remote community microgrids.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (228KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Utilizing a controlled experimental setup with 123 human forecasters and five LLMsânamely, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT3.5, Bard, Bing, and Llama2âwe evaluated forecasting precision through the absolute percentage error. Our analysis centered on the effect of the following factors on forecastersâ performance: the supporting statistical model (baseline and advanced), whether the product was on promotion, and the nature of external impact. The findings indicate that LLMs do not consistently outperform humans in forecasting accuracy and that advanced statistical forecasting models do not uniformly enhance the performance of either human forecasters or LLMs. Both human and LLM forecasters exhibited increased forecasting errors, particularly during promotional periods. Our findings call for careful consideration when integrating LLMs into practical forecasting processes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the field of precision healthcare, where accurate decision-making is paramount, this study underscores the indispensability of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of epilepsy management within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The methodology entails meticulous preprocessing, involving the application of a band-pass filter and epoch segmentation to optimize the quality of Electroencephalograph (EEG) data. The subsequent extraction of statistical features facilitates the differentiation between seizure and non-seizure patterns. The classification phase integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest classifiers. Notably, SVM attains an accuracy of 97.26%, excelling in the precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score for identifying seizures and non-seizure instances. Conversely, KNN achieves an accuracy of 72.69%, accompanied by certain trade-offs. The Random Forest classifier stands out with a remarkable accuracy of 99.89%, coupled with an exceptional precision (99.73%), recall (100%), specificity (99.80%), and F1 score (99.86%), surpassing both SVM and KNN performances. XAI techniques, namely Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), enhance the system's transparency. This combination of machine learning and XAI not only improves the reliability and accuracy of the seizure detection system but also enhances trust and interpretability. Healthcare professionals can leverage the identified important features and their dependencies to gain deeper insights into the decision-making process, aiding in informed diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe emergence of ChatGPT in the broader field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked scholarly discourse on its utilization in various disciplines. Yet, a significant void exists in our understanding of the dynamics of consumer engagement with content creators producing ChatGPT-related content. Therefore, the present study aims to delineate how ChatGPT-related content garners consumer engagement on YouTube. Data from 100 YouTube videos amassing an aggregate of 65 million views on ChatGPT were extracted using three application programming interfaces (APIs), namely, VidIQ, Tubebuddy, and SocialBlade. We subsequently contrasted this dataset with data from 200 other videos produced by the same creators. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, multigroup SEM, and comparative line graphs. Employing the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) theoretical framework, our results indicate that innovative content such as ChatGPT-related videos garners more engagement than other content types from the same YouTube channels. Intriguingly, this study finds that ChatGPT-focused content exhibited diminished sensitivity to channel subscriber counts, with channels having fewer subscribers achieving higher viewership numbers. Furthermore, ChatGPT-related content induced a surge in new subscribers to the channel compared to the other content types. The present study pioneers the investigation of audience engagement with ChatGPT-related content by juxtaposing it with other content from the same YouTube channels. We also explicate the relationship between content sensitivity and extant subscriber counts. The present study provides vital insights and implications for a diverse audience, including content creators, developers of AI tools, advertisers, and content publishers.",

    "abstract": "The prompt spread of COVID-19 has emphasized the necessity for effective and precise diagnostic tools. In this article, a hybrid approach in terms of datasets as well as the methodology by utilizing a previously unexplored dataset obtained from a private hospital for detecting COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal conditions in chest X-ray images (CXIs) is proposed coupled with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Our study leverages less preprocessing with pre-trained cutting-edge models like InceptionV3, VGG16, and VGG19 that excel in the task of feature extraction. The methodology is further enhanced by the inclusion of the t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) technique for visualizing the extracted image features and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to improve images before extraction of features. Additionally, an Attention Mechanism is utilized, which helps clarify how the model makes decisions, which builds trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, both benchmark datasets and a private dataset obtained with permissions from Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) in Karachi, Pakistan, are utilized. In 12 experiments, VGG19 showcased remarkable performance in the hybrid dataset approach, achieving 100% accuracy in COVID-19 vs. pneumonia classification and 97% in distinguishing normal cases. Overall, across all classes, the approach achieved 98% accuracy, demonstrating its efficiency in detecting COVID-19 and differentiating it from other chest disorders (Pneumonia and healthy) while also providing insights into the decision-making process of the models.",

AI chatbots such as ChatGPT by OpenAI appear to be improving in conversational and other capabilities and this paper explores such advances using version 4. Based on a review of the research literature, a conceptual framework is formulated for responsible use of AI chatbots in education supporting cognitive flexibility in AI-rich learning environments. The framework is then operationalized for use in this paper through the development of exemplars for math, english language arts (ELA), and studying with ChatGPT to close learning gaps in an effort to foster more ethical and responsible approaches to the design and development of AI chatbots for application and use in teaching and learning environments. This paper extends earlier foundational work on cognitive flexibility and AI chatbots as well as work on cognitive flexibility in support of creativity and innovation with AI chatbots in urban civic spaces.",

This paper identifies these challenges and evaluates how liability rules should be adapted in response. The paper discusses the gaps in liability that arise when AI systems are unpredictable or act (semi)-autonomously. It considers the problems in proving fault and causality when errors in AI systems are difficult to foresee for producers, and monitoring duties of users are difficult to define. From an economic perspective, the paper considers what liability rules would minimise costs of harm related to AI. Based on the analysis of risks and optimal liability rules, the paper evaluates the recently published EU proposals for a Product Liability Directive and for an AI Liability Directive.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the mental health care environment. AI tools are increasingly accessed by clients and service users. Mental health professionals must be prepared not only to use AI but also to have conversations about it when delivering care. Despite the potential for AI to enable more efficient and reliable and higher-quality care delivery, there is a persistent gap among mental health professionals in the adoption of AI.\nObjective\nA needs assessment was conducted among mental health professionals to (1) understand the learning needs of the workforce and their attitudes toward AI and (2) inform the development of AI education curricula and knowledge translation products.\nMethods\nA qualitative descriptive approach was taken to explore the needs of mental health professionals regarding their adoption of AI through semistructured interviews. To reach maximum variation sampling, mental health professionals (eg, psychiatrists, mental health nurses, educators, scientists, and social workers) in various settings across Ontario (eg, urban and rural, public and private sector, and clinical and research) were recruited.\nResults\nA total of 20 individuals were recruited. Participants included practitioners (9/20, 45% social workers and 1/20, 5% mental health nurses), educator scientists (5/20, 25% with dual roles as professors/lecturers and researchers), and practitioner scientists (3/20, 15% with dual roles as researchers and psychiatrists and 2/20, 10% with dual roles as researchers and mental health nurses). Four major themes emerged: (1) fostering practice change and building self-efficacy to integrate AI into patient care; (2) promoting system-level change to accelerate the adoption of AI in mental health; (3) addressing the importance of organizational readiness as a catalyst for AI adoption; and (4) ensuring that mental health professionals have the education, knowledge, and skills to harness AI in optimizing patient care.\nConclusions\nAI technologies are starting to emerge in mental health care. Although many digital tools, web-based services, and mobile apps are designed using AI algorithms, mental health professionals have generally been slower in the adoption of AI. As indicated by this studyâs findings, the implications are 3-fold. At the individual level, digital professionals must see the value in digitally compassionate tools that retain a humanistic approach to care. For mental health professionals, resistance toward AI adoption must be acknowledged through educational initiatives to raise awareness about the relevance, practicality, and benefits of AI. At the organizational level, digital professionals and leaders must collaborate on governance and funding structures to promote employee buy-in. At the societal level, digital and mental health professionals should collaborate in the creation of formal AI training programs specific to mental health to address knowledge gaps. This study promotes the design of relevant and sustainable education programs to support the adoption of AI within the mental health care sphere.",

However, human distrust of AI is a critical factor that may impede human-AI cooperation. Although AI agents have been endowed with anthropomorphic traits, such as a human-like appearance, in prior studies to improve human trust in AI, it is still an open question whether humans have more trust in an AI teammate and achieve better human-AI joint performance if they are deceived about the identity of their AI teammate as another human. This research assesses the effects of teammate identity (âhumanâ vs. AI) and teammate performance (low-performing vs. high-performing AI) on human-AI cooperation through a human subjects study. The results of this study show that humans behaviorally trust the AI more than another human by accepting their AI teammate's decisions more often. In addition, teammate performance has a significant effect on human-AI joint performance in the study, while teammate identity does not. These results caution against deceiving humans about the identity of AI in future applications involving human-AI cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Background\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is widely considered to be the new technical advancement capable of a large-scale modernization of health care. Considering AIâs potential impact on the clinician-patient relationship, health care provision, and health care systems more widely, patients and the wider public should be a part of the development, implementation, and embedding of AI applications in health care. Failing to establish patient and public engagement and involvement (PPIE) can limit AIâs impact.\nObjective\nThis study aims to (1) understand patientsâ and the publicâs perceived benefits and challenges for AI and (2) clarify how to best conduct PPIE in projects on translating AI into clinical practice, given public perceptions of AI.\nMethods\nWe conducted this qualitative PPIE focus-group consultation in the United Kingdom. A total of 17 public collaborators representing 7 National Institute of Health and Care Research Applied Research Collaborations across England participated in 1 of 3 web-based semistructured focus group discussions. We explored public collaboratorsâ understandings, experiences, and perceptions of AI applications in health care. Transcripts were coanalyzed iteratively with 2 public coauthors using thematic analysis.\nResults\nWe identified 3 primary deductive themes with 7 corresponding inductive subthemes. Primary theme 1, advantages of implementing AI in health care, had 2 subthemes: system improvements and improve quality of patient care and shared decision-making. Primary theme 2, challenges of implementing AI in health care, had 3 subthemes: challenges with security, bias, and access; public misunderstanding of AI; and lack of human touch in care and decision-making. Primary theme 3, recommendations on PPIE for AI in health care, had 2 subthemes: experience, empowerment, and raising awareness; and acknowledging and supporting diversity in PPIE.\nConclusions\nPatients and the public can bring unique perspectives on the development, implementation, and embedding of AI in health care. Early PPIE is therefore crucial not only to safeguard patients but also to increase the chances of acceptance of AI by the public and the impact AI can make in terms of outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this research paper, we investigated the viability of AI-supported translations of survey materials in intercultural and cross-cultural research, comparing the quality of machine translations to traditional human translations. Focusing on the HEXACO personality inventory, we translated the original English inventory using Google Translate and GPT-3.5 into 33 languages for which validated human translations exist. The statistical similarity between human- and machine-generated translations varied considerably between the target languages. It was highest for target languages from the same language family as the source language, arguably because this relatedness allowed for more direct machine translations. Consistent with this reasoning, the genetic similarity between languages largely explained the differences observed. GPTâs temperature setting determining how stringently or freely a text is translated had little influence on the similarity estimates, but very high levels tended to produce somewhat lower statistical similarity. To validate the quality of the machine translations, a group of social scientists rated the translation in a language for which the human and machine translations statistically converged strongly. Although the human translation was rated as being of higher quality than four out of five machine translations, these differences were relatively small. Crucially, the social scientists did not rate the human translation as significantly better than the GPT 3.5 translation with the lowest temperature setting. Based on these insights, we propose a framework outlining four recommendations for utilizing AI-supported translation in cross-cultural and intercultural research, involving AI to varying degrees in the forward-back translation process.",

Understanding the state of business ecosystems is an increasingly critical strategic imperative for many decision makers, but it is a resource-intensive activity as relevant information sources are dispersed, often highly unstructured, and not integrated or curated to deliver actionable insights. In this research, we present the design and implementation of an interactive visual analytic system that integrates artificial intelligence and graph visualization techniques to augment decision makersâ understanding of the complex public narrative associated with business ecosystems entities. Our system is driven by a real-time content engine of 100,000+ global data sources including press releases, news articles, industry reports, analyst blogs in multiple languages organized across several domain-specific repositories. Following a user-specified query, the engine extracts both domain-agnostic and domain-specific entities and concepts for each document in the result set. We then model and visualize the resulting data as a dynamic, multipartite network and implement graph pruning algorithms and interactive data controls to enable users to interactively explore and discover the underlying business ecosystem from multiple perspectives. We illustrate and discuss the value of our system using representative use cases. Our study makes multiple contributions to visual decision support theory and practice, including mining unstructured data, constructing and interacting with knowledge graphs, and designing visual analytic tools for ecosystem intelligence. We conclude the study with implications and future research opportunities.",
