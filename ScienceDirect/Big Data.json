        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Smart City concept aims to improve urban governance and optimize public services, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for citizens. As data generation and processing grow rapidly in volume, velocity, and variety, Smart Cities must integrate secure big data considerations into their strategic frameworks and project implementations. This paper explores how big data and data protection measures are represented in the strategies of 28 cities worldwide. To achieve this, we employed a three-phase research methodology: 1) identifying resources, 2) conducting content analysis, and 3) using the Delphi method. Our findings indicate that only half of the cities explicitly address big data in their strategies, and most lack adequate data protection measures. Additionally, the paper presents a list of recommendations for big data management and data protection, derived from measures found in Smart City strategies and validated by domain experts through the Delphi method. These recommendations aim to enhance understanding of how to effectively incorporate big data and its protection into urban planning and Smart City projects. However, it is important to note that these insights primarily apply to larger urban areas with abundant resources.",

Despite these unprecedented benefits, the understanding of how big data transform organizational processes remains limited. To address this gap, this research empirically investigates how big data analytics management capabilities (BDAMC) influence innovation performance. This study bases its assumptions on the dynamic capability and knowledge-based views. A PLS-SEM analysis of 199 firms reveals that establishing BDAMC is essential for fostering organizationsâ innovation performance. This study advances knowledge by demonstrating that BDAMC enhances organizationsâ strategic agility, which subsequently boosts innovation performance. Moreover, the empirical findings reveal that developing BDAMC is crucial for achieving strategic alignment, which in turn reinforces innovation performance. These unique findings hold significant practical value for managers and consultants seeking to leverage big data-related systems within organizations.",

First, collect hospital big data including hospital medical business system, mobile wearable devices and big health data; Secondly, use byte changes to compress hospital big data to achieve safe transmission of hospital big data; Then, the hospital sender uses the AES session key to encrypt the hospital big data and the ECC public key to encrypt the AES session key, uses SHA-1 to calculate the hash value of the medical big data, and uses the ECC public key to sign the hash value; The hospital receiver uses the ECC private key to verify the signature, and decrypts the AES session key using the ECC private key. After the AES session key decrypts, the hospital big data, the hospital big data security privacy protection is completed. The experimental results show that the method is superior to conventional ECC algorithm or RSA and AES hybrid encryption algorithm in terms of encryption and decryption time and security strength. The average correlation coefficient of encrypted hospital big data is only 0.0576, and the RL curve value is low and gentle. The encrypted data has good scrambling effect and low privacy leakage probability, which ensures the confidentiality and integrity of medical data in the transmission process.",

Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to find outliers in data that is not labeled, therefore, the anomalous instances are unknown. The exponential data generation has led to the era of Big Data. This scenario brings new challenges to classic anomaly detection problems due to the massive and unsupervised accumulation of data. Traditional methods are not able to cop up with computing and time requirements of Big Data problems.\nMethods\nIn this paper, we propose four distributed algorithm designs for Big Data anomaly detection problems: HBOS_BD, LODA_BD, LSCP_BD, and XGBOD_BD. They have been designed following the MapReduce distributed methodology in order to be capable of handling Big Data problems.\nResults\nThese algorithms have been integrated into an Spark Package, focused on static and dynamic Big Data anomaly detection tasks, namely AnomalyDSD. Experiments using a real-world case of study have shown the performance and validity of the proposals for Big Data problems.\nConclusions\nWith this proposal, we have enabled the practitioner to efficiently and effectively detect anomalies in Big Data datasets, where the early detection of an anomaly can lead to a proper and timely decision.",

However, big data driven operational analyses are still limited in scope, with only unconstrained big data driven problems, e.g. the newsvendor problem, being comprehensively explored. If big data driven analyses are to become a core part of operations research and practice, one must be able to formulate and solve constrained big data driven models. We therefore propose a direct empirical risk minimization (DERM) method for formulating and solving a class of constrained big data driven operation research problems. In big data driven problems, relevant operational prescriptions are dependent on a set of observed features. In this paper, we assume linear feature relationships, which enable us to fundamentally base the DERM method on linear stochastic programming. The assumption of linear feature relationships is also seen in the literature on big data driven newsvendor models. We prove that if a big data driven solution exists, the DERM method will always, for the class of constrained problems we study, arrive at a feasible solution of the initial opera tional problem. Moreover, we exemplify the DERM method by formulating and solving two specific big data driven operational problems. In the numerical study of the two operational problems, we show, that under linear demand, the DERM method outperforms, with regard to cost, two benchmark methods and a big data driven method from literature.",

In theory, regional planning (the practice) is based on regional science (the field of study) from which regional policy and regional development flow. The article advances the argument that Africa did not benefit from regional science in the past due to data scarcity. However, with the advent of big data and the data deluge caused by big data, regional science and regional planning stand to benefit. We argue that with the proliferation of big data, Africa can now tap into its opportunities and correct its âuglyâ past regarding regional planning. With big data and artificial intelligence (AI)-tools, coupled with skilled and capable people, Africa can effectively mine data and catch up with global trends in urban and regional planning. The study concludes that there is a need to embrace big data and mine data for African regional science and regional planning to be successful. In addition, the African regional planning project was not a failure, but it suffered a stillbirth due to a lack of data and related infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "The scale and complexity of big data are growing continuously, posing severe challenges to traditional data processing methods, especially in the field of clustering analysis. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new method named Big Data Tensor Multi-Cluster Distributed Incremental Update (BDTMCDIncreUpdate), which combines distributed computing, storage technology, and incremental update techniques to provide an efficient and effective means for clustering analysis. Firstly, the original dataset is divided into multiple sub-blocks, and distributed computing resources are utilized to process the sub-blocks in parallel, enhancing efficiency. Then, initial clustering is performed on each sub-block using tensor-based multi-clustering techniques to obtain preliminary results. When new data arrives, incremental update technology is employed to update the core tensor and factor matrix, ensuring that the clustering model can adapt to changes in data. Finally, by combining the updated core tensor and factor matrix with historical computational results, refined clustering results are obtained, achieving real-time adaptation to dynamic data. Through experimental simulation on the Aminer dataset, the BDTMCDIncreUpdate method has demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) metrics, achieving an accuracy rate of 90% and an NMI score of 0.85, which outperforms existing methods such as TClusInitUpdate and TKLClusUpdate in most scenarios. Therefore, the BDTMCDIncreUpdate method offers an innovative solution to the field of big data analysis, integrating distributed computing, incremental updates, and tensor-based multi-clustering techniques. It not only improves the efficiency and scalability in processing large-scale high-dimensional datasets but also has been validated for its effectiveness and accuracy through experiments. This method shows great potential in real-world applications where dynamic data growth is common, and it is of significant importance for advancing the development of data analysis technology.",

However, data use for decision-making practices has been significantly low in developing countries, especially in Ethiopia. Hence, it is critical to ascertain which elements influence the health sector's decision to adopt big health data analytics in health sectors. The aim of this study was to identify the level of readiness for big health data analytics and its associated factors in healthcare sectors.\nMethods\nA cross-sectional study design was conducted among 845 target employees using the structural equation modeling approach by using technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) frameworks. The target population of the study was health sector managers, directors, team leaders, healthcare planning officers, ICT/IT managers, and health professionals. For data analysis, exploratory factor analysis using SPSS 20.0 and structural equation modeling using AMOS software were used.\nResult\n58.85 % of the study participants had big health data analytics readiness. Complexity (CX), Top management support (TMS), training (TR) and government law policies and legislation (GLAL) and government IT policies (GITP) had positive direct effect, compatibility (CT), and optimism (OP) had negative direct effect on BD readiness (BDR)\nConclusion\nThe technological, organizational, and environmental factors significantly contributed to big health data readiness in the healthcare sector. The Complexity, compatibility, optimism, Top management support, training (TR) and government law and IT policies (GITP) had effect on big health data analytics readiness. Formulating efficient reform in healthcare sectors, especially for evidence-based decision-making and jointly working with stakeholders will be more relevant for effective implementation of big health data analytics in healthcare sectors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe big data generated by tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are widely used to reveal complex rock-machine interactions by machine learning (ML) algorithms. Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in improving ML accuracy. For this, a TBM big data preprocessing method in ML was proposed in the present study. It emphasized the accurate division of TBM tunneling cycle and the optimization method of feature extraction. Based on the data collected from a TBM water conveyance tunnel in China, its effectiveness was demonstrated by application in predicting TBM performance. Firstly, the Score-Kneedle (S-K) method was proposed to divide a TBM tunneling cycle into five phases. Conducted on 500 TBM tunneling cycles, the S-K method accurately divided all five phases in 458 cycles (accuracy of 91.6%), which is superior to the conventional duration division method (accuracy of 74.2%). Additionally, the S-K method accurately divided the stable phase in 493 cycles (accuracy of 98.6%), which is superior to two state-of-the-art division methods, namely the histogram discriminant method (accuracy of 94.6%) and the cumulative sum change point detection method (accuracy of 92.8%). Secondly, features were extracted from the divided phases. Specifically, TBM tunneling resistances were extracted from the free rotating phase and free advancing phase. The resistances were subtracted from the total forces to represent the true rock-fragmentation forces. The secant slope and the mean value were extracted as features of the increasing phase and stable phase, respectively. Finally, an ML model integrating a deep neural network and genetic algorithm (GA-DNN) was established to learn the preprocessed data. The GA-DNN used 6 secant slope features extracted from the increasing phase to predict the mean field penetration index (FPI) and torque penetration index (TPI) in the stable phase, guiding TBM drivers to make better decisions in advance. The results indicate that the proposed TBM big data preprocessing method can improve prediction accuracy significantly (improving R2s of TPI and FPI on the test dataset from 0.7716 to 0.9178 and from 0.7479 to 0.8842, respectively).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the vigorous development of e-commerce, more and more goods are sold online. The electronic platform not only brings convenience to people's lives but also gives more people the opportunity of employment and entrepreneurship, which contributes to the promotion of economic value and the creation of wealth. With the gradual maturity of network technology represented by Big Data, it has also led to the further development of e-commerce. In the past, e-commerce mostly used business intelligence systems for data analysis. However, as the data becomes more and more complex, the innovation ability and data analysis ability of traditional business intelligence systems are relatively conservative, so it is of great significance to update and strengthen business intelligence to analyze its role in e-commerce data. Therefore, this paper proposed the application of business intelligence based on Big Data in e-commerce data analysis. By combining Big Data and a business intelligence system and taking the e-commerce data of a certain brand of beverage as the research object, the Days-Times-Money (DTM) model was established, and the data mining technology was used to classify the brand consumers. The data results showed that among the three consumption attributes, the highest consumption density of consumption days, consumption times, and consumption amount was 68.63 %, 67.99 %, and 69.72 % respectively. These were not more than 70 %, which indicated that the consumption of this brand of beverages had a high space for growth. According to the consumption density, the users of this brand of beverage were divided into four consumer groups. According to the classification results, it provided feasible marketing reference opinions for the brand beverage and could provide direction for brand value-added by mining the hidden data of the brand beverage. This paper hoped to use the brand beverage as a case to provide reference and reality for the development of e-commerce enterprises and provide a reference for the application and promotion of business intelligence based on Big Data in e-commerce data analysis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe optimization of sustainable smart cities is an essential endeavor in modern urban development, aiming to enhance the quality of life for citizens while minimizing environmental impacts. Big data plays a critical role in achieving these goals by enabling the collection, analysis, and utilization of vast amounts of information to make informed decisions. However, implementing big data in smart cities faces significant barriers, including data-sharing challenges, technical limitations, and organizational non-cooperation. Addressing these barriers is crucial for the successful deployment of smart city initiatives. We propose a novel approach to tackle these challenges using the Improved Zero-Sum Grey Game (IZSGG) theory and the Grey Best-Worst Method (G-BWM). This method comprehensively analyzes the risks and uncertainties associated with big data implementation in smart cities. By modeling the interactions between different stakeholders and their competing interests, IZSGG theory provides a framework to identify optimal strategies for data management. The G-BWM further refines these strategies by evaluating and prioritizing the various factors influencing big data utilization. Our findings reveal that the worst-case scenario for a smart city involves the simultaneous occurrence of several risks, all of which have positive values, indicating their potential to significantly disrupt smart city operations. The specific risks identified include: the sharing of data and information, the collection and recording of data, technical limitations and challenges associated with technology, the non-cooperation of organizations, and issues related to the interpretation of complex information. The technical barrier is the most significant with a weight of\n, indicating its critical role compared to other barriers. Within this category, the sub-barrier of technical and technological constraints is particularly critical, with a weight of 0.39267375.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDigital transformation has emerged as a key driver of high-quality enterprise development and an essential tool in forging an innovation-driven paradigm.Existing studies fail to delve into the specific mechanisms of their impact on firms' innovation performance, and views on their impact are divergent. Some studies suggest that digital transformation can enhance innovation performance, while others point out that it may have negative impacts, and cannot clearly answer how big data capabilities and organisational agility play a role in the digital transformation process. Therefore, based on dynamic capability theory and systems engineering theory, this study adopts the logical framework of \"strategy-behaviour-performance\" to systematically explore the process of digital transformation that enhances firms' innovation performance through the enhancement of big data capability and organisational agility. By empirically analysing the survey data of 476 manufacturing enterprises in China, the study reveals the chain-mediated effects of big data capability and organisational agility, and confirms the key roles of both in the transformation process. The findings suggest that digital transformation significantly improves firms' innovation performance, and that the dual mediating effects of big data capability and organisational agility are important links in its influencing mechanism. These findings not only provide empirical support for the theoretical model of digital transformation, but also provide practical guidance for enterprises to formulate strategies and optimise resource allocation in the digital era. We suggest that enterprises should strengthen the cultivation of big data capabilities and organisational agility while promoting digital transformation to better adapt to and lead market changes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the retail industry, effective management of memberships is crucial, particularly within the pharmaceutical sector, as it fosters customer loyalty and drives sales growth. However, pharmacies often face challenges related to membership attrition and inactive members, which restrict the full potential of their membership programs. This research aims to address these challenges by optimizing pharmacy membership management systems through the utilization of big data technology. By leveraging the power of big data and employing machine learning algorithms, this study examines member data from multiple prominent pharmacy chains. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in significantly increasing the level of activity among inactive memberships. Furthermore, this research unveils significant behavioral patterns among pharmacy members, shedding light on their preferences, purchasing habits, and interaction patterns. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict reactivation success rates, membership activity, and sales revenue based on website/app usage and member engagement. Two input factors, namely the frequency of website/app usage and member engagement score, are evaluated alongside three output factors: reactivation success rate, increase in membership activity levels, and increase in overall sales and revenue. Tailoring strategies based on member profiles and preferences enables pharmacies to re-engage customers and cultivate renewed loyalty. Importantly, these efforts yield positive impacts beyond membership activity, influencing overall sales and revenue generation for pharmacies. The ANN analysis reveals significant correlations and acceptable prediction errors. The insights gained from this study offer valuable information for enhancing membership management strategies and adjusting marketing efforts to cater to the specific needs and expectations of diverse customer segments. The practical, data-driven approach presented in this study equips pharmacies with the means to activate and re-engage dormant members. By harnessing the potential of big data technology and leveraging machine learning algorithms, pharmacies can optimize their membership management systems, enhance customer engagement, and improve their overall retail operations. This research underscores the significance of leveraging data-driven insights in the retail industry and showcases the transformative capabilities of big data technology in enhancing customer relationship management practices.",

        "abstract": "Integrating machine learning and data mining is crucial for processing big data and extracting valuable insights to enhance decision-making. However, imbalanced target variables within big data present technical challenges that hinder the performance of supervised learning classifiers on key evaluation metrics, limiting their overall effectiveness. This study presents a comprehensive review of both common and recently developed Supervised Learning Classifiers (SLCs) and evaluates their performance in data-driven decision-making. The evaluation uses various metrics, with a particular focus on the Harmonic Mean Score (F-1 score) on an imbalanced real-world bank target marketing dataset. The findings indicate that grid-search random forest and random-search random forest excel in Precision and area under the curve, while Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperforms other traditional classifiers in terms of F-1 score. Employing oversampling methods to address the imbalanced data shows significant performance improvement in XGBoost, delivering superior results across all metrics, particularly when using the SMOTE variant known as the BorderlineSMOTE2 technique. The study concludes several key factors for effectively addressing the challenges of supervised learning with imbalanced datasets. These factors include the importance of selecting appropriate datasets for training and testing, choosing the right classifiers, employing effective techniques for processing and handling imbalanced datasets, and identifying suitable metrics for performance evaluation. Additionally, factors also entail the utilisation of effective exploratory data analysis in conjunction with visualisation techniques to yield insights conducive to data-driven decision-making.",

The complexity and size of these problems render traditional data processing methods insufficient.\nObjectives\nIn this study, we propose a new multi-objective optimization algorithm called the multi-objective African vulture optimization algorithm with binary hierarchical structure and tree topology (MO_Tree_BHSAVOA) to solve Big-Opt problem.\nMethods\nIn MO_Tree_BHSAVOA, a binary hierarchical structure (BHS) is incorporated to effectively balance exploration and exploitation capabilities within the algorithm; shift density estimation is introduced as a mechanism for providing selection pressure for population evolution; and a tree topology is employed to reinforce the algorithmâs ability to escape local optima and preserve optimal non-dominated solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using CEC 2020 multi-modal multi-objective benchmark functions and CEC 2021 real-world constrained multi-objective optimization problems and is applied to Big-Opt problems.\nResults\nThe performance is analyzed by comparing the results obtained with other multi-objective optimization algorithms and using Friedmanâs statistical test.

This study leverages open GPS trajectory big data and employs grid units to meticulously characterize the spatial patterns and associated formation mechanisms of regional-scale tourist flows in Qinghai and Gansu Provinces. The findings reveal the following: (1) Regional tourist flows exhibit a distinct âpoint-axis-ringâ agglomeration distribution pattern. (2) The âGansu-Qinghai Tourist Grand Loopâ has emerged as a predominant regional tourism corridor. Within this loop, there are smaller, high-density sub-loops centered on specific tourist attractions. (3) Ecology, service and scenic area are the three major influencing mechanisms for spatial differentiation of tourist flow in Gansu-Qinghai region. The findings can provide significant insights for the prioritization of regional tourism route marketing and planning, the configuration of tourism service facilities, etc.",

China has been implementing increasingly mature technologies for tax governance using big data systems in recent years. By collecting data through web scraping on the earliest implementation times of big data tax administration in various provinces of China, we explore the relationship between big data tax administration and corporate bank credit in emerging markets. Our results show that big data tax administration enhances firmsâ ability to obtain bank loans. Mechanism tests indicate that big data tax administration improves the quality of corporate information disclosure, facilitating access to bank credit loans. We find that big data tax administration improves the corporate financing environment, enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation in the credit market.",

With the advent of the big data era, researchers are increasingly using big data analysis to discover the laws of development. This paper combines the VAR system with big data analysis technology to study regional economic growth variables, simulate economic changes in region A, and use the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and historical simulation method to analyze the process of industrial change. The model accuracy of the two algorithms is evaluated by the historical data observation loss value of the VAR post-test. The results show that at a confidence level of 0.95, the risk prediction of the historical simulation method is more accurate. The study also found that adding additional variables to the VAR system will lead to model information loss and an increase in parameters.",

The success of land cover classification models largely hinges on the data quality, coupled with the application of Big Data techniques and distributed computing. This is essential for efficiently processing the extensive volume of available satellite data. However, maintaining the lifecycle of several annual Machine Learning models presents a complex challenge. The rise of Machine Learning Operations offers an opportunity to automate the maintenance of these models, a feature particularly beneficial in systems that require generating new models each year alongside the continuous integration of validated data. This article details the development of an end-to-end MLOps workflow, meticulously integrating land cover classification models that employ Big Data strategies for processing large-scale, high-resolution spatial data. The workflow is designed within a Kubernetes environment, achieving on-demand auto-scaling, distributed computing, and load balancing. This integration demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of managing and deploying models that treat satellite imagery in an automated, scalable framework, thus marking a significant advancement in remote sensing and MLOps.",

The data were analyzed utilizing the PLS-SEM approach, whereas data from 341 SMEs was examined. The study findings reveal significant positive relationships between GHRM and GI, GDLO and GI, GHRM practices and GDLO, and GI and SFP. The study supports the mediating role of green innovation in these relationships. Big data analytics is found to moderate the connections between GHRM-GI and GDLO-GI. This study is the first to establish the theoretical connection with the AMO model by emphasizing how GHRM and innovation enhance sustainable firm performance. Also, practical implications guide SMEs in integrating GHRM practices, raising a culture of innovation, and acknowledging the pivotal role of employees. The study recognizes limitations, urging future research to consider external factors and address gaps in the literature on GHRM practices in SME sustainable firm performance in the Gulf region.",

To capture the effects of this integration we used the perspective of affordances enabled by big data, an approach derived from sociomateriality. The research adopts a qualitative approach based on seventeen semi-structured interviews with forensic accountants. This qualitative approach allows us to identify dispositional and relational affordances. Findings show that big data enables some significant affordances. As dispositional affordances, big data and big data analytics tools ensure a greater depth of the analysis. The power of visual analytics in fraud detection is highlighted in both dispositional and relational affordances.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDiscovering knowledge from social media becomes a trend in many domains such as tourism, where users' feedback and rating are the basis of recommendation systems. In this context, cluster analysis has been a major tool to disclose user groups by which the process of collaborative filtering can better determine a personalised suggestion. Matching this to the curse of big data is a challenge with previous studies either implementing conventional techniques on a distributed system or making use of data sampling. Specific to ensemble clustering, only a few aim to obtain both scalability and privacy preserving that are significant to handling social data. This paper presents a new bi-level framework of ensemble clustering in which an instance-segment based analysis is adopted to ensure data privacy and reduce the complexity of clustering the whole dataset. Unlike existing studies, instead of drawing a single clustering from each segment, multiple clusterings are selected to better represent instances therein. Based on published tourism datasets and different experimental settings, the new approach usually outperforms its baselines whilst being competitive to related methods found in the literature. Additional case studies on simulated big datasets and noisy variations are reported and discussed in addition to the analysis of algorithmic parameters.",

Meanwhile, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has significantly changed people's travel behaviour in urban areas. This research uses the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between traffic flows, urban infrastructure, and socio-demographic indicators before, during, and after pandemic periods. We include factors such as road characteristics, socio-demographics, surrounding built environments (land use and nearby points of interest), and the emerging urban big data source of Google Street View images to understand their influences on time series traffic flows. Taking the city of Glasgow as the case study, we have found that areas with more young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows, while natural green spaces are associated with fewer traffic flows. Major roads between cities and towns also show heavier traffic flows. Besides, the application of Google Street View images in this research has revealed the heterogeneous effects of green space on urban traffic flows, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by distance. We also detect that the spatial dependence between adjacent neighbourhoods among the traffic flows and associated urban parameters is variable during the four COVID-19 periods. With the influence of COVID-19, there has been a significant decrease in long-distance travel. The noticeable change in travel behaviour presents a valuable opportunity to encourage active travel in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the development of big data technology, the field of monitoring and improving teaching quality in universities has ushered in new opportunities and challenges. Big data technology enables the capture and analysis of massive amounts of data generated during the teaching process, providing the possibility for a deeper understanding of teaching activities. However, how to extract useful information from these vast amounts of data and transform it into strategies for teaching improvement is a challenge. The research aims to propose a teaching quality monitoring and improvement method based on big data technology, which combines K-means clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm to improve the accuracy of teaching monitoring and the effectiveness of teaching improvement. In order to cope with these challenges, the study proposes a research method of big data technology based on joint K-mean clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm. The study first analyzes the teaching quality monitoring and evaluation indexes using the K-mean algorithm. Then the association rule mining algorithm is utilized to mine the data in the teaching quality monitoring indicators with association rules on the basis of the obtained cluster analysis. Finally, on the basis of association rule mining, the study constructs the assessment model of teaching quality monitoring indicators by utilizing the fused method. The outcomes revealed that the average of data analysis accuracy and the average of recall rate of the modeling method were 93.79 % and 91.95 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation time of the modeling method in the process of teaching quality monitoring data processing was 17.3 s, and the evaluation precision was 93.15 % respectively. Additionally, the process's overall confidence and enhancement are 95.01 % and 86.73 %, respectively, and the modeling method's performance is compared to other approaches. This shown that the approach may significantly boost the precision and effectiveness of monitoring the quality of instruction, as well as offer strong backing for the enhancement of instruction in higher education institutions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn modern society, people's pace of life is fast, and the pressure is enormous, leading to increasingly prominent issues such as obesity and sub-health. Traditional fitness methods cannot meet people's needs to a certain extent. Therefore, this work aims to use technology to change people's lifestyles and compensate for traditional fitness methods' shortcomings. Firstly, this work overviews neurorobotics, providing neural perception and control functions for aerobics intelligent fitness system. Secondly, the connection between big data and machine learning (ML), big data technology products, and the ML process are discussed. The Spark big data platform builds node data for calculation, and the decision tree algorithm is used for data preprocessing. These are important for future intelligent fitness analysis. This work proposes an aerobics intelligent fitness system based on neurorobotics technology and big data analysis and develops a recommendation system for the best fitness exercise. This system utilizes neural perception and control functions, combined with big data and ML technology, to solve the obesity and sub-health problems faced by people in fast-paced and high-pressure lifestyles. By harnessing the computational capabilities of the Spark big data platform and applying the decision tree algorithm for data preprocessing, the system can furnish users with personalized fitness plans and optimization recommendations. This work conducts a model performance study on 35 % aerobic fitness data on intelligent fitness Android v1.0.8 to evaluate the system's data processing ability and training effectiveness. Moreover, the aerobics intelligent fitness system models based on neurorobotics, big data, and ML are evaluated. The results indicate that normalizing the data using the Min-Max method leads to a decrease in the F1 value and a reduction in data set errors. Consequently, the dataset studied by the system model is beneficial to improving the work efficiency of the aerobics intelligent fitness system. After the comprehensive human quality of the system model is evaluated, the actual average score of the comprehensive human quality of the 13 users tested before the aerobics intelligent fitness system test is 91.44, and the average prediction score is 90.88. The results of the two tests are similar. Thus, using the intelligent fitness system can enable the user to obtain system feedback according to the actual training effect, thereby playing a guiding role in the intelligent fitness of aerobics for the user. This work designs and implements the aerobics intelligent fitness system close to the human body's training effect, further enhancing the specialization and individualization of sports and fitness.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nUsing Big Data, we processed 129,251 facial images, including expressions, from 2,085 financial reports with AI.\nâ¢\nGender stereotypes significantly influence the portrayal of women in financial report images.\nâ¢\nPositive (negative) sentiments are strongly linked to the presence of women (men) in financial report images.\nâ¢\nWe find a notable bias in image selection within financial reports, challenging neutrality notions advocated by the IASB.\nâ¢\nWe integrate facial expressions into aspect-level sentiment analysis of financial report images.\nAbstract\nThis study delves into the intricate interplay between gender stereotypes and financial reporting through an aspect-level sentiment analysis approach. Leveraging Big Data comprising 129,251 human face images extracted from 2085 financial reports in Chile, and employing Deep Learning techniques, we uncover the underlying factors influencing the representation of women in financial reports. Our findings reveal that gender stereotypes, combined with external economic factors, significantly shape the portrayal of women in financial reports, overshadowing intentional efforts by companies to influence stakeholder perceptions of financial performance. Notably, economic expansion periods correlate with a decline in women's representation, while economic instability amplifies their portrayal. Furthermore, the financial inclusion of women positively correlates with their presence in financial report images. Our results underscore a bias in image selection within financial reports, diverging from the neutrality principles advocated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This pioneering study, combining Big Data and Deep Learning, contributes to gender stereotype literature, financial report soft information research, and business impression management research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the era of big data, intelligent computation and precise targeting of advertisements rely on artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance advertising effectiveness and user experience. As advertising media shift from traditional outlets to the internet and mobile devices, manually filtering and targeting advertisements has become increasingly ineffective due to the vast amount of information and user groups. Consequently, AI-based advertisement computation and targeting technologies have emerged. This paper explores how modern technologies and AI applications can be used to achieve intelligent computation, filtering, and targeting of advertisements, thereby improving ad effectiveness and profitability. The study optimizes ad targeting effectiveness and increases return on investment (ROI) by comparing ad campaigns between Group A, which did not use ad targeting algorithms, and Group B, which employed AI-based targeting algorithms. The experimental results show that the average ROI for tourism, shopping, and rental ads in Group A were 153.03 %, 232.32 %, and 192.57 %, respectively, while Group B's average ROI were 173.96 %, 288.74 %, and 216.12 %. These results indicate that AI-based ad targeting algorithms can significantly improve the ROI of ad campaigns compared to non-algorithmic approaches, suggesting that ad targeting algorithms can help advertisers achieve higher profits.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nIn the big data era, the healthcare sector grapples with increased data volumes and the push for more intelligent medical devices. This challenge is marked by data silos, higher data processing needs, and the quest for personalized medicine, emphasizing the importance of integrating and analyzing diverse big data from medical devices. This study employs bibliometric analysis to thoroughly analyze the research trends in big data and medical device research, aiming to identify key developments, patterns, and potential future directions in the field.\nMethods\nThis study employed the Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, and Derwent Innovations Index for conducting keyword searches on âbig dataâ and âmedical devicesâ, focusing on English-language articles, reviews, and patents, while excluding duplicates. Quantitative analyses and visualizations were facilitated using tools such as R 4.3.1, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Tableau. The research assessed the impact of journals and academic contributions through metrics like the impact factor and G-Index.\nResults\nOur analysis covered 592 articles and 795 patents. Notably, the annual growth rate of articles reached 62.19%, with the primary contributions originating from China, the United States, India, and England. Among the identified publications, âIEEE Accessâ emerged as the most prominent journal. The research identified key trends in the application of big data within medical devices, including the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, genomic data analysis, and bioinformatics. Case studies show how big data and medical device integration, exemplified by Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), and smart wearables, enhance diagnostic efficiency and care quality. The study further identified intensive care units, radiology departments, and oncology as key application departments leveraging this integration.\nConclusion\nBig data and medical device integration have led to smart healthcare and personalized treatment, improving medical decision accuracy and inspiring new research directions. Future research efforts should explore the potential for incorporating even more expansive datasets and multilingual resources to further maximize the potential of this integration and advance medical technology in disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management.",

It is important to distinguish between actor effects (i.e. influence of one's own personality) and partner effects (i.e. influence of the partner's personality). In this study, we utilized three cohorts (born 1991â1993, 1981â1983, and 1971â1973) from a longitudinal data set and estimated an Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model (APIM) to examine the association between personality and relationship satisfaction over a period of 9 years in romantic relationships involving both heterosexual partners (N = 972). Our findings revealed significant actor effects, but no partner effects. Specifically, long-lasting relationship satisfaction was found to be associated with lower levels of Neuroticism and higher levels of Conscientiousness. Apart from a negative correlation between Extraversion and relationship satisfaction in women, we did not find any differences between men and women. Over a longer time span the congruence between both persons plays a smaller role than previous studies have assumed. Our results emphasize the contribution of one's own Conscientiousness and Neuroticism to the relationship satisfaction. This could be an important insight for the research into couples therapy or coaching in the context of personal development.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe computation of the skyline provides a mechanism for utilizing multiple location-based criteria to identify optimal data points. However, the efficiency of these computations diminishes and becomes more challenging as the input data expands. This study presents a novel algorithm aimed at mitigating this challenge by harnessing the capabilities of Apache Spark, a distributed processing platform, for conducting area skyline computations. The proposed algorithm enhances processing speed and scalability. In particular, our algorithm encompasses three key phases: the computation of distances between data points, the generation of distance tuples, and the execution of the skyline operators. Notably, the second phase employs a local partial skyline extraction technique to minimize the volume of data transmitted from each executor (a parallel processing procedure) to the driver (a central processing procedure). Afterwards, the driver processes the received data to determine the final skyline and creates filters to exclude irrelevant points. Extensive experimentation on eight datasets reveals that our algorithm significantly reduces both data size and computation time required for area skyline computation.",

Through an analysis of the endogenous and exogenous explicit management logic relationships among these elements, this study innovatively constructs three primary dimensions and nine secondary dimensions of digital identity attributes for users. Additionally, it establishes a collaborative management mechanism between government organizations and non-governmental blockchain alliances corresponding to identity attributes based on the delegated proxy mechanism. Furthermore, it reconstructs the big data chain management framework for user digital identity under the zero-trust model and establishes a management process for blockchain digital identity information security protection under the zero-trust model. These efforts provide innovative solutions with both research and application value for the âvirtual-real integrationâ global security governance of the metaverse, digital economy, and digital government.",

Because people spend most of their time indoors, exposure to PM2.5 in indoor environments is critical to population health. Large-population, long-term, continuous, and accurate indoor PM2.5 data are important but scarce because of the difficulties in monitoring the indoor air quality on a large scale. Model simulation provides a new research direction. In this study, an advanced machine learning model was constructed using environmental health big data to predict the daily indoor PM2.5 concentration data in 22 typical air pollution cities in China from 2013 to 2017. The test R2 value of this model reached as high as 0.89, and the RMSE of the model was 9.13. The predicted annual indoor PM2.5 concentrations of the cities ranged from 54.6â¯Î¼g/m3 to 82.7â¯Î¼g/m3, and showed a decreasing trend year by year. The pollution level exceeds the recommended AQG level of PM2.5 and has potential impact on human health. The results could take a breakthrough in obtaining accurate big data of indoor PM2.5 and contribute to research on the indoor air quality and human health in China.\nSynopsis\nThis study established a machine learning model and predicted indoor PM2.5 big data, which could support the research of indoor PM2.5 and health.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (134KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study aims to examine the advantages of utilizing big data analytics (BDA) on circular economy (CE) dual systems, which are closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) and the reverse omnichannel (ROC), aiming to enhance sustainable firm performance (SFP) of the small and medium based enterprises (SMEs). The product return knowledge (PRK) can reinforce the proposed network of relationships and facilitate the approach of active returns in CE. Using the structural equation model (SEM) in AMOS v24, the researchers examined the hypotheses using data from a simple random sample of 232 SMEs in Pakistan. Though ROC solutions provide rare performance-related benefits, however, BDA makes the CE system more efficient. CLSC gets strengthened when the PRK is developed. The improved PRK facilitates the CLSC network and enhances its performance. This study adopts a novel approach to studying CE by considering the dual system of CE in the forms of CLSC and ROC. The research investigates whether the BDA facilitates improved product return processes by improving CLSC operations and achieving service capabilities using ROC. Finally, the proposed framework is the first to investigate the benefits evolving from the PRK, which enhance the capability to sense, seize, and reconfigure the process and facilitate the approach of active return in CE. The findings suggest that firms must decide carefully between CLSC and ROC. Choosing CLSC requires higher operational capabilities, whereas deciding on ROC requires higher service capabilities. Lastly, PRK is necessary for achieving the firm's performance objectives.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUsers are increasingly turning to big data processing systems to extract valuable information from massive datasets as the field of big data grows. Data analytics platforms are used by e-commerce enterprises to improve product suggestions and model business processes. In order to meet the needs of large-scale data center operation and maintenance management, Internet companies often use Flink to process log data. This paper takes the big data processing and analysis platforms built by Internet financial companies and large banks as examples, and implants a stock prediction model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). In this context, this paper completes the following work: 1) The research status of big data processing and analysis platforms at home and abroad is introduced. 2) Drawing on the modular design idea, the commercial bank big data platform is designed and the functions of each sub-module are introduced. Then the basic principle and structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are expounded. 3) The optimal parameters of Convolutional Neural Networks are selected through experiments, and then the trained model is used for experiments. It can be seen that the stock prediction model proposed in this article has a higher prediction accuracy compared to existing models, which also verifies the validity of the proposed model. Input the data and compare the obtained results with the actual results, and finally show that the model in this paper has a good performance on stock prediction.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nOnline discourse analysis revealed public beliefs about Metaverse workplaces (MW).\nâ¢\nPositive sentiments prevailed for MW's flexibility and accessibility.\nâ¢\nPrevailing positivity was indicated by contentment, curiosity and enthusiasm emotions.\nâ¢\nHealth, privacy, readiness & practicality concerns over MW triggered some negative sentiments.\nâ¢\nTheoretical, practical and research implications were offered.\nAbstract\nThe Metaverse is gaining attention as a potential future workplace, and advancements in VR/AR technologies are set to revolutionise how we work and collaborate. Extensive research using big data is still needed to fully comprehend the public's perception of this emerging field. Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DIT), and Social Presence Theory (SPT), this study seeks to fill this knowledge gap. Using a methodology that involved machine learning and qualitative analysis of big data, the research gathered comments from social media users on widely viewed YouTube videos discussing the Metaverse workplace. The initial dataset, which contained 6982 comments, underwent thorough cleaning processes, resulting in the analysis of 2804 comments through thematic, emotion, and sentiment analyses. The process of the thematic analysis revealed that out of the total comments, 472 were unclassified, while the remaining 2332 helped structure the public's beliefs about the Metaverse workplace into four overarching themes: 1- benefits of flexibility and accessibility (37 %), highlighting VR's potential to transform workspaces, especially for creative fields and efficient space use; 2- Health concerns (26 %), including eye strain and physical discomfort from prolonged headset use; 3- data privacy and corporate control fears (20 %), reflecting worries over pervasive data collection and potential misuse of power; 4- scepticism over readiness and practicality (17 %), noting visual clarity challenges and ergonomic issues. The overall vibes about working in the Metaverse are mixed. While more than half the sentiments were positive, expressing contentment, curiosity and enthusiasm, there were also concerns about health effects, data privacy, and integration issues. The public recognises Metaverse's potential for remote work, desiring improvements in areas like visual clarity, ergonomics and productivity support before widespread adoption. This study is a pioneering effort in the field, providing a first-of-its-kind structure of the public's beliefs about the Metaverse workplace, drawing upon naturally occurring data. The findings not only contribute to the academic understanding of the Metaverse workplace but also have significant implications for society and practitioners for optimising the positive aspects to enhance overall acceptance in this relatively understudied field.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (115KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Several researchers have explored the importance of big data processing in view of Industry 4.0 as it facilitated enhanced production at any smart manufacturing line by ensuring efficient process management, typically involving big data processing. Researchers presented several MapReduce-based data processing models at smart manufacturing lines to facilitate big data processing. Among several others, the Elementary Cellular Automata (ECAs)-based MapReduce model was introduced as an energy-efficient low-cost model for big data processing in view of the Industry 4.0 scenario. In the present research, an investigation is further proposed to explore the true potential (if any) for the ECAs-based MapReduce model with reference to available several MapReduce models, to migrate an existing big data processing model from Industry 4.0 into the future i.e., Industry 5.0. Investigation results as achieved from the comparison among several MapReduce models and further examinations about the inherent quality of shuffle in those MapReduce blocks, explore the inherent advantages of ECAs-based MapReduce model towards its choice for big data processing in Industry 5.0 scenario.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nScale, diversity, access, location, and community significantly impact commercial district customer flow.\nâ¢\nLarge-scale, centrally located commercial districts with ample parking and unique features attract more customers.\nâ¢\nHigh-traffic commercial districtsâ 15-minute living circle communities have more employees, fewer residents.\nAbstract\nCommercial districts, as the epicenters of urban commerce and economic activity, largely reflect an areaâs prosperity through their customer flow. However, previous research, which often relied on statistical and survey data, has typically not captured the full scope of customer flow dynamics throughout urban commercial districts and has not adequately measured the specific impacts of business district locations and their surrounding communities on customer flow. To bridge these gaps, this study utilizes multidimensional big geo-data resources, including mobile phone signaling data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and transportation network data, to uncover the underlying factors that influence customer flow within urban commercial districts. The findings suggest that several factorsâthe size of the commercial district, the diversity of business formats, the convenience of parking, the working and residential population in surrounding communities, and the proximity to urban centersâsignificantly influence the customer flow. Consumers show a preference for larger-scale, centrally-located commercial districts that offer convenient parking options, while a homogenized and uncharacteristic business format may reduce a commercial districtâs appeal. Furthermore, the study reveals that industrial parks and mixed-use complexes within the 15-minute living circle surrounding the commercial district have a stronger attraction to customer flow than residential neighborhoods do. The insights from this research not only guide the strategic placement of new commercial centers but also provide a robust framework for enhancing the layout of urban commercial spaces and for the revitalization and advancement of established commercial districts.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently, the application scope of big data (BD for short here) technology is relatively narrow, mostly used in the medical field, and the degree of application is relatively superficial, mostly for data statistical record analysis. Therefore, By combining the literature review, this article has decided to construct a system based on BD technology for analyzing the advanced neural activity status of athletes. The system is mainly divided into two parts, one is the biological information collection part. As an important source of system data, it is necessary to use professional equipment to collect ECG and EEG data and ensure the accuracy of the data through signal filtering, Gaussian noise elimination, salt and pepper noise, and exponential noise de-noising technology. The other is the algorithm problem of BD systems. Considering that the traditional algorithm can not deal with a large amount of data effectively, this paper chooses the BD spectral clustering algorithm based on core points as the main algorithm to cluster the data. By evaluating the efficiency of system learning, data collection and classification, system scheme construction, and error rate, this article ultimately determined the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the system. After completing the construction of the system, considering the gap between the system's performance and traditional data, this article analyzed the improvement data of various aspects of sports training. This paper compares the performance differences between the system based on BD technology and the traditional data analysis method under different indicators. In terms of data collection and classification, the accuracy of the system based on BD technology in the collection and classification of ECG and EEG data reached 100 % and 90 %, respectively, which was significantly higher than 60 % and 30 % of the traditional methods. By comparing the data from five training courses, it is found that the training efficiency of the conventional method has increased by 60 % in the first course, while the efficiency of the training method based on the BD system has increased by 85 % in the fifth course. For the activation efficiency of nerve function, the activation efficiency of brain nerve function reached 60 % and 90 % respectively in the two nerve function activation training based on the BD system, which was much higher than 30 % and 45 % of the traditional methods. Through a series of tests and comparative analysis of data, the effectiveness of the BD system is finally determined, which can achieve the goal of improving athletes' training efficiency.",

Numerous research studies have been conducted to extract insights from AM data and utilize it for optimizing various aspects such as the manufacturing process, supply chain, and real-time monitoring. Data integration into proposed digital twin frameworks and the application of machine learning techniques is expected to play pivotal roles in advancing AM in the future. In this paper, we provide an overview of machine learning and digital twin-assisted AM. On one hand, we discuss the research domain and highlight the machine-learning methods utilized in this field, including material analysis, design optimization, process parameter optimization, defect detection and monitoring, and sustainability. On the other hand, we examine the status of digital twin-assisted AM from the current research status to the technical approach and offer insights into future developments and perspectives in this area. This review paper aims to examine present research and development in the convergence of big data, machine learning, and digital twin-assisted AM. Although there are numerous review papers on machine learning for additive manufacturing and others on digital twins for AM, no existing paper has considered how these concepts are intrinsically connected and interrelated. Our paper is the first to integrate the three concepts big data, machine learning, and digital twins and propose a cohesive framework for how they can work together to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability of AM processes. By exploring latest advancements and applications within these domains, our objective is to emphasize the potential advantages and future possibilities associated with integration of these technologies in AM.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (144KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the escalating impact of climate change has brought increasing attention to carbon-neutral strategies as a critical component of global environmental protection efforts. These strategies demand a comprehensive understanding of carbon emissions, which are influenced by a myriad of factors, including external conditions like seasonality and weather, as well as internal dynamics such as production and energy consumption. However, existing approaches often fail to account for these complex, dynamic interactions, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated model combining Autoformer, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Deep Forest. This model is designed to dynamically respond to environmental changes using advanced time-series forecasting, adaptive decision-making, and robust feature extraction. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets reveal that our model significantly enhances carbon capture efficiency and accuracy, outperforming conventional methods. By providing a scalable and intelligent solution for carbon capture and utilization, this research not only supports the advancement of carbon-neutral strategies but also contributes to the broader goals of sustainable development and climate change mitigation.",

Binary logistic regressions and Hayes mediation models are used to test the hypotheses. Results suggest that sustainability orientation practices and industrial big data use positively influence product innovation, and that industrial big data use mediates the relation between sustainability orientation and product innovation. The findings have implications for both theory and practice.",

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain.\nWhile solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria.\nDespite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.",

While the literature has overlooked the emotional values and wellbeing connection associated with rivers, knowing how the rivers are perceived by visitors and how the use of rivers has changed during the pandemic can assist decision-making for land use policies and planning. On the other hand, social media, assisting in articulating visitation patterns and moods proximate to the river, provides unprecedented insight to better macro- manage these areas. In this study, we employed Machine Learning to conduct a content analysis for rivers of Poland to expose User-Generated Content (UGC) through the visitorsâ lens. We aim at understanding an essential cultural hegemony, the patterns of visits, and the moods of visitors. We further compared the results with the Covid-19 daily infections. The findings suggest an increased pressure on rivers during the pandemic, specifically at the time of the lowest sentiments. Our results may help in articulating patterns and moods proximate to the river that provide unprecedented practical insight and illuminate the path for further research proposals.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (183KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPrecision medicine (PM) is an approach to healthcare that customizes treatment and prevention strategies based on individual characteristics such as genetics, environment, and lifestyle. By utilizing detailed data from diverse populations, precision medicine aims to provide accurate and effective medical care tailored to each personâs unique profile. This approach relies on the diversity of local populations which is increasingly captured through large-scale data sets, often referred to as Big Data. Due to the underrepresentation of non-European individuals in human genetic studies, many countries with diverse and underrepresented populations must build their own reference database due to a lack of holistic global perspective. This research investigated a population sub-group to better understand the factors shaping their attitudes of PM adoption in an Asian developed context. This research was based on the millennial generation in Singapore (born between 1981 and 1996). The study employed a quantitative online survey, based on the TAM theoretical framework. A total of 377 valid responses were received and the results were analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Results showed that perceived data security, subjective technical knowledge, trust in government, subjective norm and perceived usefulness influenced the attitude of millennials towards precision medicine and provided relevant insights for the successful implementation of PM approach in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research fills a significant knowledge gap by exploring the development of Big Data Analytics Skills (BAS), Diagnostic Skills (DS), and Forensic Accounting Skills (FAS) among Generation Z accounting students in Thailand. Employing a quantitative research approach, the study conducted an online survey of fourth-year accounting students from this generation, utilizing the convenience sampling technique. The investigation aimed to assess the impact of BAS and DS on FAS within the accounting student cohort. The sample consisted of 465 participants. Path analysis conducted using the SmartPLS program affirmed significant relationships: BAS significantly influences both DS (H1, Î²=0.817, p<0.001) and FAS (H2, Î²=0.391, p<0.001), while DS notably impacts FAS (H3, Î²=0.484, p<0.001), concurrently serving as a mediator between BAS and FAS (H4, Î²=0.395, p<0.001). These findings suggest the imperative need for curriculum development and tailored training programs aimed at enriching these skills among emerging accountants. Such skill enhancement is vital to equip them to grapple with the challenges inherent in the era of big data and to bolster their competence in the detection and prevention of financial fraud and deceptive practices. The study not only holds significance for the development of skills essential for future accountants but also makes substantial contributions towards enhancing transparency and accountability within the accounting and finance sector. Furthermore, it opens avenues for potential improvements in educational and training curricula in the field of accounting, ensuring alignment with the demands of the big data era and better preparing emerging accountants to effectively address the specter of potential fraud.",

To deal with nonlinear process behaviours, the process behaviour space, represented by a set of inputâoutput variable trajectories, is partitioned into linear sub-behaviour spaces (clusters), based on linear inclusion of nonlinear behaviours. A behaviour space (represented using Hankel matrices) partitioning approach is developed based on subspace angles. During online control, the BDPC controller locates the most relevant linear sub-behaviour based on the current online trajectory, which is then used to determine predictive control actions using receding horizon optimisation. The incremental stability and dissipativity conditions are developed to attenuate the effect of the error of approximating linear sub-behaviours on the output and guarantee closed-loop stability. These conditions are implemented as additional constraints during online data-driven predictive control. An example of controlling the HallâHÃ©roult process is used to illustrate the proposed approach.",

However, the non-linear relationships between visitor behaviour and built environments, particularly how these relationships have evolved during the pandemic, have not yet been extensively studied. Using over 10 million mobile big data records collected over three years in Fukuoka, Japan, incorporating the XGBoost machine learning model and SHAP-PDP interpretation method, we identified non-linear relationships between visitor behaviours and built environments. Our findings uncovered significant non-linear impacts on visitor behaviour of several urban characteristics, such as floor area ratio, building coverage ratio, road density, and POI richness. Notably, the floor area ratio exhibits a negative correlation with visit frequency below 1 but a positive correlation above 2. Building coverage ratio positively impacts visit frequency up to 1000 m2 per 10,000 m2, after which it turns negative; this correlation shifted towards a consistent negative trend during the pandemic. Road density, which usually correlates negatively with visit duration, became positively correlated above 700 m2 per 10,000 m2 during the pandemic. Similarly, the influence of floor area ratio on visit duration reversed from negative to positive under pandemic conditions. Revealing the dynamic and non-monotonic nature of how urban visitors respond to the built environment under the influence of the pandemic, our results provide valuable insights for urban planning strategies in response to crisis resiliently.",

Spatial optimization provides important theoretical foundations and solutions for determining optimal spatial arrangements or configurations of entities, resources, or goods. However, the complexity of spatial optimization problems poses critical challenges in spatial optimization problems modeling, and efficiently solving. Recently, the surge of multi-source geospatial big data, the emerging technologies such as geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), and the advancements of computing technologies along with the ever-expanding capabilities of computer and data storage resources, have created significant opportunities to the effective and efficient addressing of spatial optimization issues, even though numerous challenges still exist. Therefore, this paper aims to revisit the existing literature of spatial optimization quantitatively and qualitatively, as well as reflect on the opportunities and challenges, especially posed by geospatial big data and GeoAI. Through these efforts, we seek to stimulate greater engagement in spatial optimization research and practices, accelerate the integration of novel technologies and methods, as well as collectively advance the development of the field.",

Most preceding sampling algorithms generate samples at the record level, making it impractical to apply them to very large datasets using a single machine. Even distributed solutions encounter efficiency issues when dealing with terabyte-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a scalable sampling approach named CDFRS, which can generate samples with a distribution-preserving guarantee from extensive datasets. CDFRS exhibits significantly improved speed compared to existing sampling algorithms when dealing with terabyte-scale datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical justifications, demonstrating that samples generated by the CDFRS approach maintain the distribution characteristics of the original dataset. Additionally, we propose a sample size determination algorithm, denoted as\n. Experiment results indicate that the running time of CDFRS shows at least an order of magnitude improvement over other distributed sampling methods. Notably, sampling a 10TB dataset using CDFRS only takes hundreds of seconds, while the compared method requires more than ten thousand seconds. In the context of big data analysis, including tasks such as classification and clustering, models trained with samples generated by CDFRS closely match those trained with the entire training set. Furthermore, the proposed\nalgorithm efficiently determines an appropriate sample size compared with traditional methods.",

While the accuracy and reliability of prediction models are often prioritized, the quality of the collected data is frequently overlooked. Poor data quality can result in the common problem of âgarbage in, garbage outâ. Traditional measures of data quality, such as accuracy, consistency, completeness, and timeliness, are no longer adequate in the era of Big Data. Therefore, this paper proposes a taxonomy of data quality dimensions specifically for Big Data, addressing emerging challenges by formulating 20 dimensions and categorizing them into four distinct categories.",

        "abstract": "Big data resources are characterized by large scale, wide sources, and strong dynamics. Existing access control mechanisms based on manual policy formulation by security experts suffer from drawbacks such as low policy management efficiency and difficulty in accurately describing the access control policy. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a big data access control mechanism based on a two-layer permission decision structure. This mechanism extends the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. Business attributes are introduced in the ABAC model as business constraints between entities. The proposed mechanism implements a two-layer permission decision structure composed of the inherent attributes of access control entities and the business attributes, which constitute the general permission decision algorithm based on logical calculation and the business permission decision algorithm based on a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network, respectively. The general permission decision algorithm is used to implement accurate policy decisions, while the business permission decision algorithm implements fuzzy decisions based on the business constraints. The BiLSTM neural network is used to calculate the similarity of the business attributes to realize intelligent, adaptive, and efficient access control permission decisions. Through the two-layer permission decision structure, the complex and diverse big data access control management requirements can be satisfied by considering the security and availability of resources. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is effective and reliable. In summary, it can efficiently support the secure sharing of big data resources.",

Based on the implementation of Golden Tax Project III, we find that big data tax administration decreases corporate ESG performance. Mechanism tests indicate that Golden Tax Project III can reduce tax avoidance, cash flow and green innovation, thereby inhibiting ESG through the âtaxation effect.â Conversely, the project can reduce agency costs and improve information transparency, thus promoting ESG performance through the âgovernance effect.â Overall, however, the project inhibits corporate ESG performance. According to further analysis, the negative effect on ESG performance mainly impacts the environmental responsibility (E) element.

The accuracy on test set was 91.5%.\nâ¢\nModel training identified the Vertical overlap ratio, Arc length (Amplitude class attribute), and Amplitude variation rate are sensitive attributes for sandbody connectivity.\nAbstract\nThe connectivity of sandbodies is a key constraint to the exploration effectiveness of Bohai A Oilfield. Conventional connectivity studies often use methods such as seismic attribute fusion, while the development of contiguous composite sandbodies in this area makes it challenging to characterize connectivity changes with conventional seismic attributes. Aiming at the above problem in the Bohai A Oilfield, this study proposes a big data analysis method based on the Deep Forest algorithm to predict the sandbody connectivity. Firstly, by compiling the abundant exploration and development sandbodies data in the study area, typical sandbodies with reliable connectivity were selected. Then, sensitive seismic attribute were extracted to obtain training samples. Finally, based on the Deep Forest algorithm, mapping model between attribute combinations and sandbody connectivity was established through machine learning. This method achieves the first quantitative determination of the connectivity for continuous composite sandbodies in the Bohai Oilfield. Compared with conventional connectivity discrimination methods such as high-resolution processing and seismic attribute analysis, this method can combine the sandbody characteristics of the study area in the process of machine learning, and jointly judge connectivity by combining multiple seismic attributes. The study results show that this method has high accuracy and timeliness in predicting connectivity for continuous composite sandbodies. Applied to the Bohai A Oilfield, it successfully identified multiple sandbody connectivity relationships and provided strong support for the subsequent exploration potential assessment and well placement optimization. This method also provides a new idea and method for studying sandbody connectivity under similar complex geological conditions.",

Here, we demonstrate that physics-based models can equally benefit from training procedures relying on big data. Specifically, we employ the thermo-mechanically coupled viscoplasticity model [Anand, L., Ames, N.M., Srivastava, V., Chester, S., 2009. A thermo-mechanically coupled theory for large deformations of amorphous polymers. Part 1: Formulation. International Journal of Plasticity] to describe the large deformation response of polypropylene. It combines both mechanism-based evolution equations and high mathematical flexibility. More than 100 constant velocity and strain rate jump experiments are performed on flat tensile specimens extracted from 3 mm thick isotactic polypropylene sheets. The exact cross-sectional area is measured with surround DIC, while an IR camera monitored the surface temperature field. The experiments typically reached true strains greater than 0.8 and cover temperatures and strain rates ranging from 25 to 85 Â°C and 10â4 to 100 s-1, respectively. Training over 100,000 unique random combinations of experiments is performed to identify all model parameters. The effect of the training (and testing) subsets size and composition is carefully analyzed to ensure a high generalization ability. It is found that training based on 26 randomly-selected experiments leads to the most robust parameter estimates. The obtained model performs remarkably well on all our experiments (among which 70 % are unseen during training) with a root mean square error of less than 1.5 MPa. As a byproduct, we also found that there exists a subset of two specific experiments for training that lead to an equally accurate model for polypropylene.",

The results reveal that, the system significantly stimulates green innovation in hard-to-abate enterprises with an entrepreneurial orientation. A mechanism exploration suggests that environmental big data information disclosure drives officials to implement environmental policies aimed at hard-to-abate enterprises and raises public concern regarding environmental quality; however, the mechanism of public attention is found to be ineffective in stimulating corporate green innovation in the sample period.

Therefore, strengthening water environment monitoring has become a key measure to prevent and solve this problem. Aiming at the limitation of traditional water environment monitoring methods, a water ecological environment monitoring scheme is proposed. This study uses advanced sensor technology, including water quality sensor, water level sensor, weather sensor, etc., to monitor the indicators of water in real time. Through data acquisition and storage technology, the data obtained by the sensor is integrated and analyzed. At the same time, big data analysis method is used to predict and simulate the change trend of water ecological environment. This scheme designs and develops a sensor network monitoring system, which can collect water temperature data in real time at the monitoring point, transmit the sampled information to the aggregation node through the sensor network, and finally transmit to the information intelligent monitoring equipment through GPRS, so as to realize timely display and early warning. At the same time, combined with the water quality monitoring instrument, it can realize the remote query and processing of monitoring data. The experimental results show that the water ecological environment monitoring and management system based on sensor and big data technology can efficiently and accurately monitor the indicators of water. Through the comprehensive monitoring of the water ecological environment, abnormal situations can be found in time, and corresponding measures can be taken to protect and repair. The results of big data analysis provided by the system can provide scientific basis and guidance for decision makers.",

        "abstract": "The development of technologies such as big data and blockchain has brought convenience to life, but at the same time, privacy and security issues are becoming more and more prominent. The K-anonymity algorithm is an effective and low computational complexity privacy-preserving algorithm that can safeguard usersâ privacy by anonymizing big data. However, the algorithm currently suffers from the problem of focusing only on improving user privacy while ignoring data availability. In addition, ignoring the impact of quasi-identified attributes on sensitive attributes causes the usability of the processed data on statistical analysis to be reduced. Based on this, we propose a new K-anonymity algorithm to solve the privacy security problem in the context of big data, while guaranteeing improved data usability. Specifically, we construct a new information loss function based on the information quantity theory. Considering that different quasi-identification attributes have different impacts on sensitive attributes, we set weights for each quasi-identification attribute when designing the information loss function. In addition, to reduce information loss, we improve K-anonymity in two ways. First, we make the loss of information smaller than in the original table while guaranteeing privacy based on common artificial intelligence algorithms, i.e., greedy algorithm and 2-means clustering algorithm. In addition, we improve the 2-means clustering algorithm by designing a mean-center method to select the initial center of mass. Meanwhile, we design the K-anonymity algorithm of this scheme based on the constructed information loss function, the improved 2-means clustering algorithm, and the greedy algorithm, which reduces the information loss. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in improving the effect of 2-means clustering and reducing information loss.",

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in these assessments has shown great promise, yet the \"black box\" nature of AI models often undermines trust due to the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes, even when these models demonstrate high accuracy. To address this challenge, we evaluated the performance of a transformer model against other AI approaches, utilizing extensive multivariate and spatiotemporal environmental datasets encompassing both natural and anthropogenic indicators. We further explored the application of saliency maps as a novel explainability tool in multi-source AI-driven environmental assessments, enabling the identification of individual indicators' contributions to the model's predictions. We find that the transformer model outperforms others, achieving an accuracy of about 98% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891. Regionally, the environmental assessment values are predominantly classified as level II or III in the central and southwestern study areas, level IV in the northern region, and level V in the western region. Through explainability analysis, we identify that water hardness, total dissolved solids, and arsenic concentrations are the most influential indicators in the model. Our AI-driven environmental assessment model is accurate and explainable, offering actionable insights for targeted environmental management. Furthermore, this study advances the application of AI in environmental science by presenting a robust, explainable model that bridges the gap between machine learning and environmental governance, enhancing both understanding and trust in AI-assisted environmental assessments.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (367KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This work proposes a novel algorithm to forecast multivariate big data time series. This new general-purpose approach consists first of a previous pattern recognition performed jointly using all time series that form the multivariate time series and then predicts the target time series by searching for similarities between pattern sequences. The proposed algorithm is designed to tackle multivariate time series forecasting problems within the context of big data. In particular, the algorithm has been developed with a distributed nature to enhance its efficiency in analyzing and processing large volumes of data. Moreover, the algorithm is straightforward to use, with only two parameters needing adjustment. Another advantage of the MV-bigPSF algorithm is its ability to perform multi-step forecasting, which is particularly useful in many practical applications. To evaluate the algorithmâs performance, real-world data from Uruguayâs power consumption has been utilized. Specifically, MV-bigPSF has been compared with both univariate and multivariate methods. Regarding the univariate ones, MV-bigPSF improved 12.8% in MAPE compared to the second-best method. Regarding the multivariate comparison, MV-bigPSF improved 44.8% in MAPE with respect to the second most accurate method. Regarding efficiency, the execution time of MV-bigPSF was 1.83 times faster than the second-fastest multivariate method, both in a single-core environment. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers working in multivariate time series forecasting, particularly in big data applications.",

The investment and financing of network enterprises and the merger and acquisition of network companies need to evaluate the value of network companies. In this regard, this paper evaluated the value of Internet platform enterprises under the digital economy based on the Big Data (BD) cooperation asset valuation model. This paper analyzed the factors affecting the value evaluation of Internet enterprises and discussed the advantages of BD cooperative asset valuation model in the value evaluation of Internet enterprises in the digital economy. The BD cooperation asset valuation model was constructed, and the value evaluation experiment of Internet platform enterprises under the digital economy was carried out. The experimental results of this paper showed that in the evaluation of the profitability value of Internet enterprises, the difference between the net sales interest rate was 0.14%â0.51 %. The difference between the net interest rate of equity was 0.09%â0.67 %, and the difference between the net interest rate of total assets was 0.19%â0.92 %; in terms of the evaluation of the operating capacity of Internet enterprises, the difference between the current asset turnover rate was 0.05â0.16. The difference of non-current asset turnover rate was 0.02â0.15, and the difference of total asset turnover rate was 0.01â0.16. The evaluation value based on the BD cooperation asset valuation model was not different from the actual enterprise value, which showed that the BD cooperation asset valuation model had good advantages in the evaluation of the value of Internet enterprises.",

In this paper, we present the definition of a marked reduction set and propose a more efficient attribute reduction algorithm (RA-MRS). The RA-MRS includes a batch processing phase and a vibration optimization phase, which reduce the number of jobs from |C| to log2|C|. Additionally, we provide an effective judgment strategy based on MapReduce, which supports the exception processing mechanism of Java to interrupt and advance the current job. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in parallel based on Spark computing framework. The experimental results show that the proposed RA-MRS algorithm is over 99% faster than the classical PAAR_PR algorithm and 70% faster than the algorithm in the literature (Yin et al., 2021).",

The adoption and integration of digital technologies are boosting the production of data that can be collected, analyzed, and exploited for decision-making through big data analytics. Data can play a significant role in healthcare since it is a complex system where every decision is affected by risk and uncertainty. This study investigates how big data analytics (BDA) enables the use of risk management (RM) practices, resulting in improving the quality of healthcare services (QoHS). It also analyses the indirect effect of BDA on the QoHS through the use of RM practices. To this aim, 204 responses from Italian healthcare professionals were collected and investigated via the lens of Organizational Information Processing Theory using PLS-SEM methodology. The results revealed that BDA contributed positively and significantly to the use of RM practices, while only the use of risk identification and monitoring practices impact healthcare service quality significantly and mediate the relationship between BDA and QoHS. The results provide managerial insights about the use of data to support the decision-making process in healthcare showing that decision-makers should focus their effort on integrating data-driven tools and capabilities with RM practices to reduce the uncertainty surrounding this environment and ensure a higher quality of healthcare services.",

Traditional evaluation methods (such as Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution, TOPSIS) mainly calculate the comprehensive score of each indicator through weighting. These methods have limitations in handling multidimensional data and system nonlinearity, and they cannot fully reveal the complex relationships and interactions within the sustainability systems of small towns. In contrast, the evaluation model combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Catastrophe Progression Method (CPM) used in this study can better handle multidimensional data and system nonlinear relationships, reducing subjectivity in evaluation and improving the accuracy and reliability of the assessment results. The specific research process is as follows: First, based on the United Nations SDG11 framework, using multi-source big data, a theoretical framework and evaluation index system for the sustainable development of small towns suitable for the Chinese context were established. The impact of county-level factors on the sustainable development of small towns was also considered, and an entropy weight-grey correlation model was used to measure these impacts, resulting in a town-level dataset incorporating county-level influences. Secondly, the sustainability levels of 782 top small towns in China were evaluated using the comprehensive evaluation model based on PCA-CPM Model. Finally, an improved diagnostic model was used to identify obstacles influencing the sustainable development of small towns. The main findings include: 52.69% of the small towns have a sustainable development score exceeding 0.7255, indicating that the overall performance of small towns is at a medium to high development level. The development of small towns exhibits significant differences across regions and types, which are closely linked to county-level effects. Economic and social factors are the main obstacles to the sustainable development of small towns, and the impact of these obstacles intensifies from the eastern to the central, western, and northeastern regions. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and scholars, promoting a deeper understanding of the sustainable development of small towns.",

To address the gap, this study conducts the overlapping communities analysis in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), a megaregion in South China, using big geospatial data from 2018. A novel Overlapping Community Detection based on Density Peaks (OCDDP) is employed to generate multiple communities with diverse functions for different nodes in the commuting network of 60 sub-city divisions. We identify eight overlapping communities in PRD characterized by two categories of communities predominantly centered around Shenzhen and Guangzhou, revealing a bicentric spatial structure. Notably, central sub-cities are characterized by a low-overlap attribute, while peripheral sub-cities manifest a high-overlap tendency. Furthermore, the study investigates the driving forces behind these communities through ridge regression to analyze the impacts of various spatial flows, including policies, investment amount and times, branch funding and number, travel cost, and travel distance, co-patenting, and search index. This part found that four Shenzhen-centric communities are primarily driven by travel cost, co-patenting, branch funding, and number, while the four Guangzhou-centric communities are influenced by co-patenting, investment amount, and times. This study emphasizes differentiated functional linkages and the need for precise policy positioning and resource allocation, paving the way for a coordinated and holistic approach to megaregional development.",

Among the technological investment, a notable development is the applications of big data analytics (BDA), which plays a pivotal role in supporting firms' decision-making processes. Big data technologies are important factors that could help both exploratory and exploitative innovation, which could affect the efforts to combat climate change and ease the shift to green energy. However, studies that comprehensively examine BDA's impact on innovation capability and technological cycle remain scarce. This study therefore investigates the impact of BDA on innovation capability, technological cycle, and firm performance. It develops a conceptual model, validated using CB-SEM, through responses from 356 firms. It is found that both innovation capability and firm performance are significantly influenced by big data technology. This study highlights that BDA helps to address the pressing challenges of climate change mitigation and the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. However, our results are based on managerial perceptions in a single country. To enhance generalizability, future studies could employ a more objective approach and explore different contexts. Multidimensional constructs, moderating factors, and rival models could also be considered in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nInvestigate spatiotemporal distribution of emergency needs and traffic conditions impact on emergency services.\nâ¢\nIntegrate randomly distributed emergency needs and traffic states into the set coverage model.\nâ¢\nProvides new ideas and methods for improving planning and site selection model and enhancing first-aid stations efficiency.\nAbstract\nAmid the escalating conflicts between urban demography, resource availability, and environmental constraints, there is an accelerating demand for emergency medical services prompted by a spectrum of factors including diseases, natural calamities, and unforeseen events. This growth is further accentuated by an imbalance in the allocation of emergency facilities, amplifying public anxiety and underscoring the urgent necessity for scientifically informed optimization of pre-hospital emergency facilities. To this end, the present study articulates specific optimization goals for facility deployment and introduces a nuanced set coverage optimization model that integrates spatiotemporal determinants of emergency service requirements. The model is fortified with a constellation of constraints, including spatial constraint, temporal constraint, and coverage constraint. For spatial constraints, we use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the spatial distribution of emergency demands. Temporal constraints involve determining the actual travel time matrix from predicted demand points to candidate sites. Coverage constraints specify the effective demand coverage rate. This study uses Nanjing as a case example, utilizing multisource big data, including ambulance GPS logs from June 2016 to May 2017, Amap traffic congestion indicators, and survey data on existing emergency facilities in Nanjing City. By preprocessing and analyzing the existing data, this study thoroughly investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of emergency demands and the impact of traffic congestion on emergency service effectiveness. Consequently, the model incorporates constraints that ensure, under the specified planning and actual traffic conditions, 95 % of the simulated emergency demands can be met within an 8-minute on-route time. Locations for pre-hospital emergency stations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, achieving the best solution at the 120th iteration. Verification confirms 134 optimal sites; after excluding 52 existing sites, 82 potential sites are identified. The new layout plan has reduced Nanjingâs average emergency response time from 18.6 min to 12 min. Additionally, under peak and average traffic conditions, emergency demand coverage rates improved from 76.92 % and 83.18 % at 15 min to 95.61 % and 98.10 % at 12 min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new layout significantly enhances practical application effectiveness. The approach presented in this paper addresses the previously overlooked randomness of emergency incidents and traffic conditions, offering innovative strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency station planning and site selection models.",

Geographic information systems (GIS) are well established, but the use of GIS technology within finance and trade analysis is still in its infancy. In this article, we highlighted the potential of GIS technology and big data analytics and demonstrated the importance of thinking in spatial terms for analysing patterns within the trade and finance industries. We studied spatiotemporal trade and shopping patterns in the city of Tabriz using data generated by customer purchase transactions obtained from 5200 stores, shopping, business and service centres. We employed time series transaction data collected from the points of sale in stores, shopping, service and business centres located in different areas of the city. We applied four well known geospatial big data driven approaches including machine learning nearest neighbour, kernel density estimation, spaceâtime pattern mining and spatiotemporal coupling tele-coupling for detecting and mapping of spatial trade hotspot patterns. The results of this study indicated the potential of GIScience methods for the explicit spatial mapping of trade and shopping patterns. The results revealed that the city centre, particularly the Bazaar of Tabriz, acts as the cityâs heart of trade, and we identify additional major business hotspots. Furthermore, the results allow for studying the impacts of unbalanced urban development in Tabriz, where the wealthy suburbs with high quality of life, such as Valiasr and Elguli, host the major shopping hotspots. The spatial patterns obtained enable local stakeholders, decision makers and authorities to develop strategic plans for urban sustainable development in Tabriz. The geospatial big data approach used can stimulate novel and progressive research. Results of this study demonstrate methodological advancements in GIScience by âspatializingâ individual purchase data and therefor proposing an explicit geospatial big data analysis approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the increasingly important issue of sustainable tourism development through the lens of Big Data analytics, economic considerations, and policy frameworks. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, we formulated seven hypotheses to explore how these variables impact attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, intentions, and actual engagement in sustainable tourism. Using a questionnaire-based survey we collected data from N=398 respondents and employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for data analysis, we found substantial evidence supporting our hypotheses. Findings revealed that Big Data analytics significantly influence attitudes towards sustainable tourism. Economic factors shape societal norms and expectations regarding sustainable tourism, whereas policy frameworks impact individuals' perceived control over sustainable tourism activities. The study also confirmed that positive attitudes towards sustainable tourism led to higher intentions to engage in such practices, which in turn are predictive of actual engagement. Furthermore, societal norms and perceived behavioural control were found to be significant predictors of both the intention to engage in and the actual engagement with sustainable tourism practices. Overall, the results indicate that Big Data analytics play a significant role in shaping attitudes and behaviors towards sustainable tourism. Moreover, economic and policy considerations were also found to be key determinants. This research not only fills a scholarly gap but also provides actionable insights for policymakers and business stakeholders in the tourism sector.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe recreational escape rooms have recently emerged as a rapidly growing and widely embraced form of consumer entertainment. However, the industry's expansion has brought forth certain challenges, notably the lack of authoritative oversight, which has led to issues such as piracy and theme infringement. To address these concerns, this study explores the management complexities of immersive entertainment venues from the perspective of responsive regulation. The study begins by abstracting a dataset of online cultural products related to entertainment venues into a complex network using specific measurement standards. A method employing the K-means clustering algorithm is then proposed to partition the associative structure of this complex network. The K-means clustering algorithm is particularly suitable for this task due to its efficiency in handling large-scale data, strong scalability, and ability to quickly and effectively group network nodes based on a defined objective function. Additionally, the algorithm allows for flexible adjustment of the number of clusters according to specific needs. Furthermore, the study enhances and tests the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm to validate its effectiveness and practicality. The findings reveal that when the distance criterion value is set at a = 2, the improved PBFT algorithm exhibits exceptional performance. This discovery significantly enhances the security and control measures in immersive entertainment venues, enriching the theoretical framework related to administrative regulation and providing crucial theoretical resources for future legislative efforts. Finally, the study presents policy recommendations to strengthen the regulation of immersive entertainment venues. This study offers effective technical support for optimizing consumer market management measures and contributes to the development of new entertainment venues.",

Assessing the affective domain of distance education becomes challenging because the instructor cannot observe the studentâs behavior. This article proposes an assessment of the affective domain for distance education systems implemented with big data technologies. An assessment model called AMADEUS has been developed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to explore assessment factors and formulate the model. Then, the constructed model was verified by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). AMADEUS consists of 12 factors in 4 components: responsibility, interest in course material, class participation, and honesty. The experimental results indicated that AMADEUS was consistent with the empirical data and passed all criteria for consideration. After that, an assessment and reporting tool called MOZART has been developed. MOZART employed the AMADEUS model to assess studentsâ affective domain from log files using Hadoop and ELK stack technologies. The MOZART usability assessment results are at a good level in all aspects.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nGenome-wide association mapping studies (GWAS) based on Big Data are a potential approach to improve marker-assisted selection in plant breeding. The number of available phenotypic and genomic data sets in which medium-sized populations of several hundred individuals have been studied is rapidly increasing. Combining these data and using them in GWAS could increase both the power of QTL discovery and the accuracy of estimation of underlying genetic effects, but is hindered by data heterogeneity and lack of interoperability. In this study, we used genomic and phenotypic data sets, focusing on Central European winter wheat populations evaluated for heading date. We explored strategies for integrating these data and subsequently the resulting potential for GWAS. Establishing interoperability between data sets was greatly aided by some overlapping genotypes and a linear relationship between the different phenotyping protocols, resulting in high quality integrated phenotypic data. In this context, genomic prediction proved to be a suitable tool to study relevance of interactions between genotypes and experimental series, which was low in our case. Contrary to expectations, fewer associations between markers and traits were found in the larger combined data than in the individual experimental series. However, the predictive power based on the marker-trait associations of the integrated data set was higher across data sets. Therefore, the results show that the integration of medium-sized to Big Data is an approach to increase the power to detect QTL in GWAS. The results encourage further efforts to standardize and share data in the plant breeding community.",

With appropriate technical and organizational resources in place, enterprises can extract considerable value from the vast amount of available data, thereby increasing their competitive advantage. Therefore, to utilize big data resources effectively, enterprises should focus on improving the intellectual abilities of big data analysts. Big data analytics intellectual capability (BDAIC) refers to the specialized skills and knowledge that employees of the enterprise possess, including technical, technical management, business, and relational knowledge, that would enable them to use analytics tools to accomplish organizational tasks and shape the core competitiveness of an enterprise. This study constructs a theoretical model that focuses on the mediating role of person-tool fit and examines the mechanisms by which BDAIC affects an enterprise's operational performance. The results show that BDAIC, which contains four basic categories of knowledge, positively influences an enterprise's operational efficiency. Additionally, person-tool matching mediates BDAIC's effect on an enterprise's operational performance. These findings explore the latest avenues of exploration in the research paradigm of big data analytics. Furthermore, this study has important implications for practitioners trying to use big data to improve business performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the domain of efficient management of resources and ensuring nutritional consistency, accuracy in predicting crop yields becomes crucial. The advancement of artificial intelligence techniques, synchronized with satellite imagery, has emerged as a potent approach for forecasting crop yields in modern times. We used two types of data: spatial data and temporal data. Spatial data are gathered from satellite imagery and processed using ArcGIS to extract data about crops based on several indices like NDVI and NWDI. Temporal data are gathered from agricultural sensors such as temperature sensors, rainfall sensor, precipitation sensor and soil moisture sensor. In our case we used Sentinel 2 satellite to extract vegetation indices. We have used IoT systems, especially Raspberry Pi B+ to collect and process data coming from sensors. All data collected are then stored into a NoSQL server to be analysed and processed. Several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been used for the processing of crop recommendation system, such as logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, support vector machine, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM through the collected dataset. We used GRU deep learning model for the best performance, the RMSE and R2 for this model was 0.00036 and 0.99 respectively.\nThe main contribution of our paper is the development of a new system that can predict several crop yields, such as wheat, maize, etc., using IoT, satellite imagery for spatial data and the use of sensors for temporal data. We are the first paper that has combined spatial data and temporal data to predict crop yield based on deep learning algorithms, unlike other works that uses only remote sensing data or temporal data. We created an E-monitoring crop yield prediction system that helps farmers track all information about crops and show the result of prediction in a mobile application. This system helps farmers with more efficient decision making to enhance crop production. The main production regions of wheat in Morocco are in the rainfed areas of the plains and plateaus of Chaouia, Abda, Haouz, Tadla, Gharb and SaÃ¯s. We studied three main regions well known for wheat production which are Rabat-SalÃ©, Fez-Meknes, Casablanca-Settat.",

Panel data are collected through SafeGraph, and combined with GIS and American Community Survey data. We analyze 12,227 visitations from 1121 block groups to 30 neighborhood parks from September 2019 to August 2020 in Austin, Texas. Time-fixed-effect nested regression models are employed to control for unobserved time-related effects. Findings indicate a substantial increase in overall park use during the pandemic, with visiting frequencies up by 22â¯% and dwell time by 56â¯%. In contrast, minority groups, including seniors, children, blacks, unemployed, living alone, and recent movers, exhibited a decline in park visits. It also highlights visitorsâ risk-averse behaviors during the pandemic, such as avoiding visiting parks during holiday weeks and avoiding using swimming pools. Before the pandemic, proximity held the utmost significance for park use; during the pandemic, park quality and facilities emerged as the primary factors influencing park utilization. This study suggests that park planning needs to improve neighborhood parksâ proximity, park facilities, and park safety to boost park use and foster inclusive park planning.",

This paper designs an intrusion detection system based on data clustering analysis algorithm. The hardware part of the intrusion detection system is composed of six parts: detection module, adaptive module, control management module, risk early warning module, control access module and data acquisition module. Each module is closely connected and updated with the rule base and database in real time; In the software flow design of the system, based on the data clustering analysis algorithm, the collected original data are classified and processed, and the Mings distance is determined, revealing the difference between normal data and abnormal data, and finally realizing the accurate detection of cloud computing network intrusion behavior. The experimental results show that the proposed intrusion detection system has a higher detection accuracy for malicious data, and the average missed detection rate can be controlled below 0.3 %.\nConclusion\nthe detection system designed in this paper has more advantages in stability performance.",

The findings of this paper are as follows. First, the big data policy significantly promotes China's digital economy development. Second, cities at a higher administrative level receive higher policy benefits than cities at a lower administrative level. Third, technological innovation and human capital are important ways for the big data policy to improve the development of the digital economy. The conclusions of this paper not only help to assess the effectiveness of big data policies and ensure the efficacy of policy implementation, but also provide policy support for local governments to fully explore the value of data elements and grasp the new opportunities for the digital economy development with the help of the pilot zones.",

        "abstract": "In todayâs highly competitive retail industry, offline stores face increasing pressure on profitability. They hope to improve their ability in shelf management with the help of big data technology. For this, on-shelf availability is an essential indicator of shelf data management and closely relates to customer purchase behavior. RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) pattern mining is a powerful tool to evaluate the value of customer behavior. However, the existing RFM pattern mining algorithms do not consider the quarterly nature of goods, resulting in unreasonable shelf availability and difficulty in profit-making. To solve this problem, we propose a quarterly RFM mining algorithm for On-shelf products named OS-RFM. Our algorithm mines the high recency, high frequency, and high monetary patterns and considers the period of the on-shelf goods in quarterly units. We conducted experiments using two real datasets for numerical and graphical analysis to prove the algorithmâs effectiveness. Compared with the state-of-the-art RFM mining algorithm, our algorithm can identify more patterns and performs well in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, with the recall rate nearing 100%. Also, the novel algorithm operates with significantly shorter running times and more stable memory usage than existing mining algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the sales trends of products in different quarters and seasonal variations.

We aimed to use hospital big data to optimize and personalize laboratory data interpretation, focusing on platelet count.\nMaterial and methods\nLaboratory tests were extracted from the hospital database and exploited by an algorithmic stepwise procedure. For any given laboratory test Y, an âoptimized and personalized reference populationâ was defined by keeping only patients whose laboratory values for all Y-correlated tests fell within their own usual reference intervals, and by partitioning groups by individual-specific variables like sex and age category. The method was applied to platelet count.\nResults\nLaboratory data were recorded for 28,082 individuals. At the end of the algorithmic process, seven correlated laboratory tests were chosen, resulting in a reference sample of 159 platelet counts. A new 95 % reference interval was constructed [152â334 Ã 109/L], notably reduced (27.2 %) compared to conventional reference values [150â400 Ã 109/L]. The reference interval was validated on a sample of 2,129 patients from another downtown laboratory, emphasizing the potential transference of the hospital-derived reference limits.\nConclusion\nThis method offers new perspectives in laboratory data interpretation, especially in patient screening and longitudinal follow-up.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (218KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

With the explosive growth of data volume, traditional big data processing platforms are facing more and more challenges, including insufficient computational efficiency and resource utilization. At the same time, cloud native technology has emerged as a key factor in filling this gap due to its flexibility, automated management, and cross platform compatibility. Although cloud native technology has broad prospects, its application in the field of big data is still in its early stages, and there are still many problems that need to be solved. Among them, the unity of cluster management, the collaboration between operation and development, and the efficiency of technology architecture transformation are the main challenges currently faced. To address these issues, we will conduct in-depth research around cloud native technology, big data computing engine technology, and containerized services, exploring and implementing a big data computing engine management and optimization solution based on cloud native technology. By proposing and implementing cloud native deployment methods, containerized construction methods, and a one-stop big data application management and development platform, the aim is to provide new ideas and methods for solving many problems in traditional big data computing engine management, and to contribute to the development and innovation of the big data field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThere is a long-standing criticism in academic circles about the inadequacy of engineering industrial experience for professors in Chinese research universities, but there is a lack of analysis of the manifestations and root causes of the problem. The research aims to contribute meaningful insights into the factors influencing the industrial experience of engineering professors in Chinese research universities, facilitating informed policymaking and fostering collaborative efforts between academia and industry. This paper examines Chinese engineering professors' industrial experience using big data mining, computing, modeling, and image rendering. The data was collected from the publicly available CVs from the websites of various Chinese universities which contains data on colleges and universities across China and analyzed engineering professors' professional trajectories and industrial experience using the method of resume analysis. A nonlinear logistic regression model is fitted to determine the impact of multiple independent variables on the probability of engineering industrial experience among professors, with logit transformation and maximum likelihood estimation. The results show that a low percentage of engineering university professors in Chinese research universities have had industry employment after obtaining their Ph.D. degrees. The regression model indicates that gender, level of inbreeding, overseas study experience, university level, and birth age significantly affect the engineering experience of professors. This study proposes several policy recommendations based on comparative analysis and its research. The study's findings are critical for policymakers to create policies that promote industrial partnerships as a fundamental aspect of the professional development of engineering faculty and for further research in the field.",

However, long-term and frequent treatment not only damages the physiological functions of patients but also leads to serious economic burdens and mental stress. This can easily cause a series of psychological disorders in patients, resulting in severe rejection and fear of MHD. To reduce patient resistance and improve the quality of life of MHD, this article built an intelligent nursing system based on big data and then used the constructed intelligent nursing system to research MHD. Through experiments, it has been found that compared to self-efficacy intervention, intelligent nursing systems can control the concurrent rate of MHD patients below 14 %, and self-efficacy intervention methods can control the concurrent rate of MHD patients above 13 %. Moreover, using intelligent nursing systems can improve the ability of MHD patients to self-care. At the same time, before the use of intelligent nursing systems, the nursing satisfaction of MHD patients also varied greatly, with the overall satisfaction rate after use being 70 % higher than before. Using intelligent nursing systems can improve the satisfaction of MHD patients with nursing outcomes.",

Public involvement and engagement could be a way of establishing public support for big data research.\nObjective\nThis review aims to synthesize the evidence on public involvement and engagement in big data research.\nMethods\nThis scoping review mapped the current evidence on public involvement and engagement activities in big data research. We searched 5 electronic databases, followed by additional manual searches of Google Scholar and gray literature. In total, 2 public contributors were involved at all stages of the review.\nResults\nA total of 53 papers were included in the scoping review. The review showed the ways in which the public could be involved and engaged in big data research. The papers discussed a broad range of involvement activities, who could be involved or engaged, and the importance of the context in which public involvement and engagement occur. The findings show how public involvement, engagement, and consultation could be delivered in big data research. Furthermore, the review provides examples of potential outcomes that were produced by involving and engaging the public in big data research.\nConclusions\nThis review provides an overview of the current evidence on public involvement and engagement in big data research. While the evidence is mostly derived from discussion papers, it is still valuable in illustrating how public involvement and engagement in big data research can be implemented and what outcomes they may yield. Further research and evaluation of public involvement and engagement in big data research are needed to better understand how to effectively involve and engage the public in big data research.\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nRR2-https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050167",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSustainability-oriented decision-making requires adequate information and dedicated information technology support. However, integrating economic, social and environmental information requires a new understanding of how data is collected and shared among stakeholders. Ensuring the quality of sustainable information will depend on capabilities to collect and analyze large-scale data. While the potential benefits of digital technologies and sustainability have been widely publicized in the cutting-edge literature, little is known about the analytical capabilities of big data and sustainable information. This study aims to examine the prominence of big data analytical capabilities for sustainable information quality in an emerging market, in this case, Brazil. A scalar-type questionnaire was used to collect primary data from Brazilian multinational companies. The results indicate that big data analytical capabilities are substantive for sustainable information quality. This study is original, fills a gap in the literature and makes significant contributions: (a) sheds light on the prominence of big data analytical capabilities for sustainable information quality (b) signals the relevance of intangible capabilities; (c) serves as a guide for managers in deciding on priority capabilities to improve the quality of sustainable information directed to stakeholders; (d) ex-tends existing studies on analytical capabilities of big data and sustainable information quality; (e) shows that big data analytical capabilities bring benefits to support sustainable information quality in emerging markets; and finally (f) this research contributes to the literature on sustainable information and digital trans-formation with emerging technologies.",

Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the global economy, comprising of 90 % of businesses worldwide. However, only 10 % SMEs have adopted big data analytics despite the competitive advantage they could achieve. Previous research has analysed the barriers to adoption and a strategic framework has been developed to help SMEs adopt big data analytics. The framework was converted into a scoring tool which has been applied to multiple case studies of SMEs in the UK. This paper documents the process of evaluating the framework based on the structured feedback from a focus group composed of experienced practitioners. The results of the evaluation are presented with a discussion on the results, and the paper concludes with recommendations to improve the scoring tool based on the proposed framework. The research demonstrates that this positioning tool is beneficial for SMEs to achieve competitive advantages by increasing the application of business intelligence and big data analytics.",

This transformation necessitates innovation and reform in traditional financial management practices to effectively address the challenges posed by big data. In this study, a simulation model is proposed that combines high-resolution imaging algorithms and computer technology to analyze the intricacies of big data financial management. By collecting and processing vast amounts of financial data, the simulation model employs high-resolution imaging algorithms for data analysis and pattern recognition. This enables the refinement and control of financial management through precise analysis and prediction. The results demonstrate that the simulation model, based on high-resolution imaging algorithms, yields more accurate financial data analysis and prediction, empowering companies to make well-informed decisions. The utilization of this method significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of financial management, reducing manual errors and decision deviations. Compared to traditional financial management methods, this approach promotes the refinement and control of financial management, thereby propelling the development of modern company management.",

Trust has been shown to be an important correlate of compliance with COVID-19 containment policies. However, the previous findings depend upon two assumptions: first, that compliance is time invariant, and second, that compliance can be measured using self reports or mobility measures alone. We relax these assumptions by calculating a new time-varying measure of compliance as the association between containment policies and people's mobility behavior. Additionally, we develop measures of trust in others and national institutions by applying emotion analysis to Twitter data. Results from various panel estimation techniques demonstrate that compliance changes over time and that increasing (decreasing) trust in others predicts increasing (decreasing) compliance. This evidence indicates that compliance changes over time, and further confirms the importance of cultivating trust in others.",

However, it does not appear to go above and beyond our expectations in terms of offering fresh views and resources to investigate this trend in terms of measurement. In this brief study, I show how Dimensions.ai, a new academic big data resource, can be used to assess knowledge-based innovation processes in emerging and transitional countries like Vietnam. This article investigates creativity and collaboration in Ho Chi Minh City using a ân-tuple helixâ framework based on Loet Leydesdorffâs sociological theory of communication. From a social network standpoint, I argued that a cityâs innovation system is inextricably linked to its position in intercity and global co-authorship networks. This shows how the helix model and applications can be utilized to discover a data-driven society.",

It also outlines a framework that can address the big data challenge in HEIs to handle QA monitoring using BI dashboards and a prototype dashboard is presented in this paper. The dashboard was developed using a utilisation tool to monitor QA in HEIs to provide visual representations of big data. The prototype dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor compliance with QA standards while addressing the big data challenge associated with the substantial volume of data managed by HEIsâ QA systems. This paper also outlines how the developed system integrates big data from social media into the monitoring dashboard",

With the advantages of big data analysis, this traditional monitoring method has been further strengthened, allowing it to better realize real-time monitoring of financial data. Through early detection of security incidents, potential risks are reduced and the normal operation of the accounting system is ensured. Experiments have proven that the enhanced monitoring system has made great improvements in the identification and statistics of network security incidents. There is an average accuracy rate of 95%, which shows that the system is reliable and has the ability to enhance safety measurements.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper discusses the research progress of correlation analysis algorithms in visualization of smart medical and health big data. It first analyzes the main problems of current healthcare big data analysis, such as inefficiency in handling large-scale data, insufficient data privacy protection and poor algorithmic interpretability. Then, the relevant research results and shortcomings in the existing literature are reviewed, as well as the relevant policies of smart healthcare and health big data. The article proposes the use of Apriori correlation analysis algorithm to improve analysis efficiency, enhance data privacy protection, and improve the interpretability of the algorithm. Through precision and reliability experiments, the method performs well in processing large-scale medical data, and the visualization results are significant.The Apriori algorithm processes medical data with an accuracy of 92%, a recall rate of 89%, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.95, which indicates that it is efficient and reliable. The above research results provide a valuable reference direction for the future development of smart medical health data analysis.",

However, as the size of transaction databases grows, the traditional basket analysis techniques and systems become less effective because of two issues in the applications of the big data age: data scalability and flexibility to adapt different application tasks. This paper proposes a scalable distributed frequent itemset mining (ScaDistFIM) algorithm for basket analysis on big transaction data to solve these two problems. ScaDistFIM is performed in two stages. The first stage uses the FP-Growth algorithm to compute the local frequent itemsets from each random subset of the distributed transaction dataset, and all random subsets are computed in parallel. The second stage uses an approximation method to aggregate all local frequent itemsets to the final approximate set of frequent itemsets where the support values of the frequent itemsets are estimated. We further elaborate on implementing the ScaDistFIM algorithm and a flexible basket analysis system using Spark SQL queries to demonstrate the systemâs flexibility in real applications. The experiment results on synthetic and real-world transaction datasets demonstrate that compared to the Spark FP-Growth algorithm, the ScaDistFIM algorithm can achieve time savings of at least 90% while ensuring nearly 100% accuracy. Hence, the ScaDistFIM algorithm exhibits superior scalability. On dataset GenD with 1 billion records, the ScaDistFIM algorithm requires only 360 s to achieve 100% precision and recall. In contrast, due to memory limitations, Spark FP-Growth cannot complete the computation task.",

It also determines the interaction between big data organizational culture and leader commitment in influencing digitalization strategy adoption. Following a pilot test to ensure the suitability of the measures, a three-wave survey was conducted to obtain data from 438 hotels in an emerging economy. Structural equation modeling results reveal that three stakeholder factors (i.e., customer orientation, supplier cooperation, and employee information technology skills) positively affect big data organizational culture, which in turn enhances the adoption of digitalization strategies. Moreover, leader commitment moderates the link between big data organizational culture and digitalization strategy adoption. These findings advance the extant literature on hospitality digital transformation and digitalization strategy. They also provide important implications for hospitality managers in understanding and promoting big data culture and digitalization strategy adoption.",

This study develops a data-driven and scalable method based on big data and data fusion from multiple sources to comprehensively analyze substitutions and the environmental impacts of SES from trip to city level analysis. Field trip transaction data in three major Swedish cities (Stockholm, Gothenburg, and MalmÃ¶) are leveraged for empirical analysis considering mode choice behavior. The results reveal that most SES trips (86.7% in Stockholm, 85.6% in Gothenburg, and 85.3% in MalmÃ¶) replace walking or public transport, while the proportion substituting private car and taxis is less than 12%. On average, each SES trip increases in\nemissions (34.58 g in Stockholm, 21.18 g in Gothenburg, and 24.07 g in MalmÃ¶). Only a limited percentage of SES trips (19.20% in Stockholm, 24.22% in Gothenburg, and 23.94% in MalmÃ¶) and a small percentage of urban areas with SES (8.3% in Stockholm, 7.48% in Gothenburg, and 2.02% in MalmÃ¶) demonstrate positive environmental effects from SES. The substitution and environment impacts of SES vary significantly across different trips spatially and temporally, emphasizing the importance of conducting trip-level analyses. The analysis provides quantitative insights into the sustainability of SES in Nordic contexts, offering potential support for sustainable management in a variety of urban contexts.",

With the rapid development of big data, higher requirements have been put forward for data processing and analysis, especially in the design and implementation of network technology systems. In response to the above issues, this article intends to simulate and implement the intelligent networking technology system in the big data environment. Based on big data, the article can identify and analyze the laws and trends contained in it by collecting and processing a large amount of Internet data and using data mining methods. This article can adopt a series of machine learning methods and apply them to network traffic prediction and network security improvement. This method can monitor the real-time operation status of the network and predict possible network congestion and attack behaviors, in order to achieve rapid and automated management of the network. The system throughput fluctuates with slight changes in response time, but typically remains between 495 and 530 requests per second. The experiment shows that the method used in this article can effectively improve data processing speed, error detection rate, and system stability.",

The abundance of data has rendered it increasingly arduous for users to pinpoint specific information they require. However, various forms of recommendation algorithms proffer solutions to this challenge. These algorithms predict items or products that may pique usersâ interest based on their historical behavior, preferences, and interests. As one of the current hot research fields, recommendation algorithms are extensively employed across E-commerce platforms, movie streaming services, and various other contexts to cater to the diverse needs of users. In this context, a multi-recommendation algorithms comparison platform is proposed, which includes a two-fold model: online evaluation and offline evaluation. Taking the data set of the Chinese Amazon online shopping mall as the experimental data, item-based collaborative filtering (Item-CF) algorithm, content-based (TF-IDF) algorithm, item2vec model, alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and neural network algorithm are evaluated in the offline model. In the real-time recommendation part, model-based algorithm is used to achieve the usersâ rating mechanism. And the metrics used for evaluation include: precision, recall, accuracy and performance. The experimental results show that the average performance of hybrid algorithms such as ALS algorithm and neural network algorithm is higher than that of other traditional algorithms, and the real-time recommendation system achieves the purpose of improving recommendation speed. By integrating various recommender algorithms into the multi-recommendation algorithms comparison platform, this platform automatically computes and presents various performance indicators based on the user-provided dataset. It aids E-commerce platforms in making informed decisions regarding algorithm selection.",

In order to efficiently process and analyze this data and extract valuable information from it, the analysis and visualization of Big Data (BD) of the IoT based on Edge Computing (EC) has become a hot topic in current research. How to efficiently process and analyze these data has become a current research hot topic. Based on EC technology, this paper used a solution for BD analysis and visualization of the IoT. This paper used Sobel operator and edge extraction algorithm to analyze the BD analysis and visualization research of the IoT based on EC. Firstly, useful information in the image is extracted through the Sobel operator to improve image quality, in order to better understand and utilize image data; Then, edge extraction algorithms are used to quickly and accurately extract the edge information of the image for subsequent data processing and analysis. This scheme used EC nodes to preliminary process and analyze the data, reduced the burden of the central server, and improved the response speed and real-time performance. At the same time, this article also designed a visualization platform to display the analysis results in the form of charts, making it easy for users to intuitively understand the data situation. The experimental results showed that the score of data and information visualization results based on EC was between 89 and 95. The research results showed that the IoT BD analysis and visualization research method based on EC could effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of IoT data processing and achieve more intuitive data display through experiments. BD analysis and visualization technology can rely on IoT devices to extract useful information and knowledge, and help users better achieve monitoring, control, and decision support for IoT devices.",

Early prevention of this dangerous condition significantly impacts public health and considerable socioeconomic outcomes. The emergence of electronic health records (EHR) and the availability of real-world clinical data have provided opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by using artificial intelligence tools. In this study, we focus on the early recognition of risk factors, which can provide valuable information for early prediction of myocardial infarction and promoting a healthy life. Based on a big clinical dataset, we develop a predictive analytics approach for myocardial infarction. A vital step in efficient prediction is assessing the significance of input features, their relationships and their contributions to the disease. Therefore, we adopted statistical techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and feature engineering. To reveal patterns and insights on our dataset, we implemented machine learning (ML) models varying from classical to more sophisticated: decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), gradient boosting algorithms (GBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost) and deep neural networks (DNN). The imbalance-data issue is tackled by employing random under-sampling technique. The light gradient boosting model (LightGBM) with feature engineering on the balanced dataset is the best prediction performance achieved in this study.",

Based on the sintering big data, this paper proposes the Optuna-DFNN model by combining the fuzzy neural network algorithm, the deep neural network algorithm and the Optuna framework to address the problems of difficulty in tuning the parameter, lack of self-learning ability, and poor generalisation of the model of the traditional method when faced with the input of multiple parameters. The paper predicts the four prediction indexes of yield rate, return fines ratio, drum index and RDI+3.15 respectively. Among them, the relative error of the prediction of the yield rate is within 1.3â¯%, the relative error of the prediction of the return fines ratio is within 2.8â¯%, the relative error of the prediction of the drum index is within 0.32â¯%, and the relative error of the prediction of the RDI+3.15 is within 1.4â¯%. The results indicate that the Optuna-DFNN model has better performance in predicting sintering performance metrics. Based on the Optuna-DFNN sintered ore performance prediction model, the quality of sintered ore can be accurately predicted, the sintering process parameters can be adjusted in a timely manner, the sintering process can be optimized, and the utilization coefficient of sintering can be improved. Provide a reference for the optimisation of production processes, with a positive impact on cost reduction, environmental protection and increased sustainability of production.",

However, traditional rehabilitation methods often rely on rehabilitation centers or hospitals, which are not only costly, but also greatly reduce the efficiency and accessibility of rehabilitation due to time and space limitations. The rapid development of wearable technology and big data analysis technology provides the possibility for real-time, accurate and personalized rehabilitation monitoring. Therefore, this paper focuses on the architecture and design of wearable sports rehabilitation monitoring system based on big data technology, and explains in detail sensor data acquisition and processing analysis, cloud computing and data storage, as well as user interface and interaction design. Finally, the results of two groups of simulation experiments are as follows: the accuracy rate of sports rehabilitation data increases by 11.9%, and the rehabilitation effect increases by about 20.8% on average. Through long-term data collection, the system helps researchers and doctors better understand the complex dynamics of the rehabilitation process, providing a scientific basis for future rehabilitation methods.",

By integrating big data technology, financial planning and budget management can become more dynamic and adaptable. This can enable enterprises to analyze historical data and market trends, and more accurately formulate financial budgets to make the most timely decisions. Through experimental data, it can be concluded that the use in financial planning and budget management can significantly improve the financial efficiency and decision-making quality of enterprises. It can be seen that the budget management effect of the financial planning and budget management system with the addition in the manual review process increased from 53.41% to a maximum of 128.30%, and most of the data was above 114.76%. The accuracy rate of the system's testing plan, improvement success rate, and completely infeasible judgment accuracy were all above 98.35%. It is not difficult to find that enterprises can optimize budget allocation through data-driven methods, better understand market and customer needs, and achieve revenue growth and cost savings, ultimately improving their competitiveness.",

The investigation of carbon budget variation and carbon balance zoning at the intra-city scale, however, has not received much scholarly attention. By integrating firm-level big data with other datasets, this paper aims to simulate high-resolution carbon emissions and sinks and to reveal the spatiotemporal variation of carbon budgets within Nanjing, one of metropolises in eastern China, between 2010 and 2019. We then formulated a carbon balance zoning scheme for 111 township-level regions of Nanjing based on the evaluation indicator system and clustering methods. Empirical results imply that the spatial pattern of carbon emissions has experienced a reshaping tendency from core-periphery to polycentric structure, while the scale and geography of territorial ecosystem carbon sinks remained stabilize during the past decade. There existed a spatial agglomeration effect in functional zones oriented by intra-city carbon balance of Nanjing. These are tied to determinants such as urban expansion, population redistribution, industrial restructuring, as well as regulations on energy use, natural resource supervision and ecosystem protection. The newly built urban sub-centers and new-towns in Nanjing were spatially overlapping with regions where significant changes in carbon budgets occurred. Our findings suggest that the current system of territorial governance should be reformed to support the adoption of major function and carbon balance zoning oriented by carbon peaking and neutrality at finer geographical scales in China.",

To enhance their sustainability, operational efficiency, and competitiveness, maritime organizations are therefore very keen to build big data analytics capability (BDAC). However, various barriers, mean that only a handful are able to do so. We adopt a mixed-method approach to analyze these barriers. Thematic analysis is used to identify five categories of barriers and 16 individual barriers based on empirical data collected from 26 maritime organizations. These are then prioritized using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), followed by total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) to understand their interrelationships. Finally, cross-impact matrix multiplications applied to classification (MICMAC) is employed to differentiate the role of each barrier based on its driving and dependence power. This paper makes several theoretical contributions. First, China's hierarchical cultural value orientation encourages competition and obedience to rules, resulting in unwillingness to share knowledge, lack of coordination, and lack of error correction mechanisms. These cultural barriers hinder BDAC development. Second, organizational learning category barriers are found to be the most important in impeding BDAC development. This study also raises practitioners' awareness of the need to tackle cultural and organizational learning barriers.",

This was to be achieved through the implementation of a proposed methodology in the processes related to the âLast Mileâ, leveraging Big Data and Lean Logistics to boost the productivity of light logistics SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). To identify the conditions impacting the distribution processes, a study was conducted on a population of 750 S MEs, utilizing a sample of 255 companies through stratified probabilistic sampling. The research spanned the years 2022 and 2023. The methodology advocated in this study combines Lean Logistics and Big Data to enhance the supply chain's efficiency and profitability for SMEs engaged in light logistics, amidst the post-pandemic landscape and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. This methodology was structured into three stages: firstly, the organization of the customer shipment database; secondly, the cleaning of this database to pinpoint records scheduled for distribution; and thirdly, the assignment of delivery rates and probabilities using historical delivery outcomes. The findings suggested that the integration of Lean Logistics and Big Data offers a viable solution for improving the supply chain efficiency and profitability for light logistics SMEs during the post-pandemic period and amidst the Ukraine-Russia conflict. This research's originality is underscored by its novel approach of merging Lean Logistics and Big Data to fortify the supply chain efficiency and profitability for SMEs in light logistics, a synergy not previously identified in existing literature.",

Many studies assess navigation in vista space virtual reality environments and compare hippocampal-lesioned individualsâ performance to that of small control samples, potentially stifling detection of preserved and impaired performance. Using the mobile app Sea Hero Quest, we examined navigation in diverse complex environments in two individuals with hippocampal lesions relative to demographically matched controls (N = 17,734). We found surprisingly accurate navigation in several environments, particularly those containing a constrained set of sub-goals, paths, and/or turns. Areas of impaired performance may reflect a role for the hippocampus in anterograde memory and more flexible and/or precise spatial representations, even when the need for allocentric processing is minimal. The results emphasize the value of combining single cases with big data and illustrate navigation performance profiles in individuals with hippocampal compromise.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (122KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Although state-of-the-art correction tools can provide high accuracy to improve such analysis, they are limited to apply a single correction algorithm while also requiring long runtimes when processing large NGS datasets. Furthermore, current parallel correctors generally only provide efficient support for shared-memory systems lacking the ability to scale out across a cluster of multicore nodes, or they require the availability of specific hardware devices or features. In this paper we present a Big Data Error Correction (BigDEC) tool that overcomes all those limitations by: (1) implementing three different error correction algorithms based on the widely extended\n-mer spectrum method; (2) providing scalable performance for large datasets by efficiently exploiting the capabilities of Big Data technologies on multicore clusters based on commodity hardware; (3) supporting two different Big Data processing frameworks (Spark and Flink) to provide greater flexibility to end users; (4) including an efficient, stream-based merge operation to ease downstream processing of the corrected datasets; and (5) significantly outperforming existing parallel tools, being up to 79% faster on a 16-node multicore cluster when using the same underlying correction algorithm.

This study aims to explain the flight searches from London and Manchester to the Costa Blanca using variables from big data sources: online hotel satisfaction levels, flight price, hotel price, and temperature. Data for three years (2019, 2020 and 2021) are analyzed and the results are compared. The results show that online hotel satisfaction levels heterogeneously explain flight searches during these years. Hotel price positively explains searches from London. Flight price only influenced searches in 2019. Temperature in outbound destinations is the variable that best explains flight searches. This study contributes to the literature on strategic management of tourist destinations by explaining the potential tourist demand in the early decision-making stages of a trip. We highlight that the explanatory variables do not behave consistently during the years analyzed.",

An incentive-based demand response framework is constructed, emphasizing the aggregation of demand-side resources for active participation in the power market. Utilizing a data-driven approach, the improved Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict customer behavior in response to incentives. The primary objective is to maximize the life cycle benefit while minimizing the payback period for users investing in energy storage. By harnessing big data analytics, suitable users for energy storage investment are identified and optimal capacity allocation is determined. Given the current energy storage parameters and dynamics of electricity pricing, boundary values for profitable user energy storage capacities are derived. This methodology filters users with capacities exceeding these thresholds, marking them as potential candidates for energy storage deployment. Furthermore, a measurement model for iron phosphate batteries is introduced. Analysis of adjustable resource capacity, duration, and benefits for potential users provides insights into optimal energy storage investment strategies. Integrating configured energy storage batteries with time-of-use tariffs substantially reduces energy storage costs, leading to enhanced economic efficiency.",

A lot of confidential data is being transmitted electronically between people and businesses. Cyber-attacks, which are the inevitable result of our growing reliance on digital technology, are a reality that we must face today. This paper aims to investigate the impact of Big Data Analytics (BDA) on information security and vice versa. Additionally, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Deep Learning (DL) method for Anomaly Detection (AD) is presented in this work. To improve AD, the proposed method uses a DL-based detection method, which is used to parse through many collected security events to develop individual event profiles. The paper also investigated how BDA can be used to address Information Security (IS) issues and how existing Big Data technologies can be adapted to improve BDA's security. This study developed a DL-based Security Information System (DL-SIS) using a combination of event identification for data preprocessing and different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The feasibility and impact of implementing a Big Data Analytics (BDA) system for AD are investigated and addressed in this study. From this study, we learn that BDA systems are highly effective in securing Critical Information Setup from several discrete cyberattacks and that they are currently the best method available. By analyzing the False Positive Rate (FPR), the system facilitates quick action by security analysts in response to cyber threats. DL-SIS had the highest AD accuracy of 99.40% but performed poorly in the high-dimensional dataset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMalaysia's solid waste generation is showing a worrying increasing trend, while public awareness towards achieving zero waste remains low. As a big data resource, social media gives valuable insight into the public's perspective on zero waste and, as such, may be fully utilized as an active informal learning platform to lessen the reliance on formal environmental education. Using big data analytics on Instagram, this study aimed to assess the public knowledge, attitude and practice concerning zero waste lifestyle in Malaysia in order to develop an informal learning strategy on social media. Purposive data sampling was conducted on Phantombuster using zero waste-related Instagram hashtags, which yielded 1723 high engagement posts and 1500 comments from 35 identified hashtags. The recorded posts were analyzed using descriptive statistics and sentiment analysis on Python's TextBlob. A total of 94.3% of posts were published by public and private sector accounts, highlighting their vital role in facilitating active knowledge sharing across the online zero waste communities. The sentiment analysis results indicated 41.3% of comments were fairly positive, while 36.1% were more objective and knowledge oriented, acknowledging the collective individual actions that have initiated influential social change in Malaysia. This study advances the existing literature on zero waste and informal learning by recommending the use of big data analytics on social media in the local context. Only with full commitment from all parties to raising public awareness about waste management will the zero waste nation be realized.",

This paper proposes an end-to-end scalable architecture for the continuous early identification of new Tor sites and the daily analysis of their content. The solution is built using an Open Source Big Data stack for data serving with Kubernetes, Kafka, Kubeflow, and MinIO, continuously discovering onion addresses in different sources (threat intelligence, code repositories, web-Tor gateways, and Tor repositories), downloading the HTML from Tor and deduplicating the content using MinHash LSH, and categorizing with the BERTopic modeling (SBERT embedding, UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN document clustering and c-TF-IDF topic keywords). In 93 days, the system identified 80,049 onion services and characterized 90% of them, addressing the challenge of Tor volatility. A disproportionate amount of repeated content is found, with only 6.1% unique sites. From the HTML files of the dark sites, 31 different low-topics are extracted, manually labeled, and grouped into 11 high-level topics. The five most popular included sexual and violent content, repositories and search engines, carding, cryptocurrencies, and marketplaces. During the experiments, we identified 14 sites with 13,946 clones that shared a suspiciously similar mirroring rate per day, suggesting an extensive common phishing network. Among the related works, this study is the most representative characterization of onion services based on topics to date.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective\nTo establish a nasopharyngeal carcinoma-specific big data platform based on electronic health records (EHRs) to provide data support for real-world study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\nMethods\nA multidisciplinary expert team was established for this project. Based on industry standards and practical feasibility, the team designed the nasopharyngeal carcinoma data element standards including 14 modules and 640 fields. Data from patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who visited Southern Hospital after 1999 were extracted from 15 EHRs systems and were cleaned, structured, and standardized using information technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing. In addition, a series of measures such as quality control and data encryption were taken to ensure data quality and patient privacy. At the platform application level, 10 functional modules were designed according to the needs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma research.\nResults\nAs of 1 October 2022, the Big Data platform has included 11,617patients, of whom 8228 (70.83 %) were male and 3389 (29.17 %) were female, with a median age of 48 years (interquartile range, 40 years). The data in the platform were validated to have a high level of completeness and accuracy, especially for key variables such as social demographics, laboratory tests and vital signs. Currently, six projects involving risk factors, early diagnosis, treatment efficacy and prevention of treatment-related toxic reactions have been conducted on the platform.\nConclusions\nWe have established a high-quality NPC-specific big data platform by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources in the EHR. The platform provides an effective tool and strong data support for real-world studies of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which helps to improve research efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the quality of research results. We expect to promote multicenter nasopharyngeal carcinoma data sharing in the future to facilitate the generation of high-quality real-world evidence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This article may provide some reference value for other comprehensive hospitals to establish a big data platform for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

With the emergence of big data and digital transformation, a growing number of researchers have highlighted the need for organizations to develop BDACs. Despite valuable efforts to examine determinants and contributions to performance measures, the research field on BDACs remains relatively unexplored. The review reveals a patchwork of studies lacking a theoretical and conceptual foundation and questions arise regarding the reliability and validity of predominantly survey-based empirical studies. Drawing on findings from related capability concepts, this paper suggests the use of clearer definitions and items and a greater variety of methods to facilitate further exploration of BDACs. Finally, future research areas and implications are outlined.",

Members have accumulated rich experiences dealing with typhoons' negative impact and developed the technologies and measures on typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning in various ways to reduce the damage caused by typhoon. However, it is still facing many difficulties and challenges to accurately forecast the occurrence of typhoons and warning the potential impacts in an early stage due to the continuously changing weather conditions. With the development of information technology (IT) and computing science, and increasing accumulated hydro-meteorological data in recent decades, scientists, researchers and operationers keep trying to improve forecasting models based on the application of big data and artificial intelligent (AI) technology to promote the capacity of typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning. This paper reviewed the current status of application of big data and AI technology in the aspect of typhoon-related disaster risk forecasting and early warning, and discussed the challenges and limitations that must be addressed to effectively harness the power of big data and AI technology application in typhoon-related disaster risk reduction in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRegular visits to park green space offer remarkable benefits for the physical and mental health of urban residents. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the utilization across the entire city is a prerequisite for improving the overall utilization rate of park green spaces. Traditional social survey methods are limited by their sample size and time-consuming nature, while methods based on geographic location big data are gaining momentum. This study focuses on Xuchang, a medium-sized city in China, and systematically analyzes the current state and influencing factors of park green space utilization by mining GPS trajectory big data from April 3 to 12, 2022. Results indicate that residents' choices of park green spaces are highly diverse. Approximately 20% of visitors on holidays and weekends, and about 25% of visitors on weekdays, prefer the park green space closest to their homes. Notably, the distance threshold for park green space visits on weekdays, weekends, and holidays is 3633, 3824, and 4127 m, respectively. These distances are significantly higher than the several hundred meters specified in planning documents or commonly used in accessibility analyses. For individuals who frequently visit park green spaces, distance is the most critical influencing factor. Conversely, for those who occasionally visit, distance is not the primary consideration. For individuals who rarely or never visit park green spaces, personal attitudes play an essential role. In comparison to weekdays, the number of visitors on holidays and weekends is larger, the travel distance is longer, and they are more inclined to choose larger parks. Visits are concentrated in the afternoon and evening, and weather changes remarkably affect park green space utilization. Importantly, no compensatory effect is observed between the frequency and duration of park green space visits. These findings hold important implications for urban planning, management, and the promotion of park green space utilization.",

Each of the themes is discussed in context with BD-enabled marketing.\nâ¢\nBDA tools helps in developing efficient market campaigns for a newly launched FMCG product and help in promotional activities by identifying and targeting consumers.\nâ¢\nBDA enable an FMCG firm to monitor their reactions in real-time and marketers can go for personalized targeting.\nâ¢\nThe BDA finds its application in monitoring and tracking customer sentiment and behavior in real time thereby getting perception about a product from consumer point of view.\nâ¢\nThe strategies of FMCG product marketing to be opted by the firms are based on the innovations of business models and the data science being used.\nAbstract\nDue to the industrial revolution and, thereby with, the emergence of Industry 4.0, there has been an impact on the marketing of business firms, enabling them to digitally transform and adopt Marketing 4.0 practices supported by smart technologies. One of these is Big Data Analytics (BDA), which enables a firm to improve its marketing practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate how integrating big data technology improves the marketing strategies of Indian FMCG companies operating in a dynamic and highly competitive market distinguished by its size and diversity, constantly changing consumer behaviour, and Marketing 4.0 trends. This study adopts a systematic approach to coding an interview with seasoned Indian FMCG professionals to explain the capabilities of Big Data in molding marketing practices. A framework is constructed based on the same. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed to visualize its applicability in business. Further, the Resource-based View (RBV) theory is discussed for describing the insights into the role and adoption of Big Data by Indian FMCG firms for enhancing performance and achieving competitiveness, along with demonstrating its benefits for decision-making, customer loyalty and internal capability assessment.",

        "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nSummarized how big data can be applied in Precambrian research.\nâ¢\nConjoint analyses using big geochemical data reveal NCC formation and evolution.\nâ¢\nRevealing magma cycle indicates NCC involved supercontinent cycle since Archean.\nâ¢\nML-based crust thickness reconstruction highlights arc subduction in NCC formation.\nâ¢\nSpatio-temporal analyses suggest prolonged accretion in Precambrian NCC development.\nAbstract\nThe enigmatic nature of the Precambrian era poses ongoing challenges for researchers seeking to uncover its secrets. With the exponential growth of scientific data, there exists a vast repository of information through which these mysteries can be explored. However, this data is often derived from fragmented investigations of geological phenomena within specific disciplinary domains and limited spatiotemporal boundaries, resulting in untapped potential for extracting undiscovered knowledge. To address this limitation, the field of big data science provides a foundation for multidisciplinary research on the geological evolution of the Precambrian. By harnessing the power of large-scale data integration and analysis, valuable insights into this pivotal era in Earth's history can be revealed. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of big data types in geoscience and elucidates common analysis methods. Through a case study focused on the North China Craton (NCC), we demonstrate the application of conjoint analysis to a dataset comprising rock and mineral geochemistry data. Employing local singularity analysis and wavelet analysis on zircon age frequency and Hf isotopic time series, we reveal a persistent long-term periodicity of 800â500 million years since 3.5 billion years ago. This finding indicates a co-evolution between the NCC and the global supercontinent cycle dating back to the Archean period. To investigate the formation of the NCC, we employ machine learning-based crustal thickness evolution reconstruction, which highlights arc formation during subduction as the primary factor, with regional mantle activities playing a secondary role in the convergence. Combining spatio-temporal evolution analysis of magmatic intensity and ÎµHf(t) values, we infer that the development of the NCC primarily resulted from a prolonged process of accretion targeting the Eastern Block (the primary continent nuclei) through the incorporation of diverse arc massifs. This examination of the NCC serves as an example of how data collection, processing, and utilization can enhance our understanding of formational and evolutionary processes, signaling a paradigm shift in Precambrian research driven by the integration of big data.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (266KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

MerTK plays an important role in redox homeostasis.\nâ¢\nBig data analytics for MerTK biology are based on bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data, and BioGPS.\nâ¢\nMerTK has completely different functions depending on disease types and sex differences.\nâ¢\nThe specific pharmacologic approaches to regulate MerTK expression are promising clinical strategies that are worthy for future investigation.\nAbstract\nRationale\nMER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) is a key receptor for the clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) and plays important roles in redox-related human diseases. We will explore MerTK biology in human cells, tissues, and diseases based on big data analytics.\nMethods\nThe human RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data about 42,700 samples were from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and analyzed by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) with about 170,000 crossover analysis. MerTK expression was quantified as Log2 (FPKM + 0.1).\nResults\nWe found that, in human cells, MerTK is highly expressed in macrophages, monocytes, progenitor cells, alpha-beta T cells, plasma B cells, myeloid cells, and endothelial cells (ECs). In human tissues, MerTK has higher expression in plaque, blood vessels, heart, liver, sensory system, artificial tissue, bone, adrenal gland, central nervous system (CNS), and connective tissue. Compared to normal conditions, MerTK expression in related tissues is altered in many human diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and brain disorders. Interestingly, MerTK expression also shows sex differences in many tissues, indicating that MerTK may have different impact on male and female. Finally, based on our proteomics from primary human aortic ECs, we validated the functions of MerTK in several human diseases, such as cancer, aging, kidney failure and heart failure.\nConclusions\nOur big data analytics suggest that MerTK may be a promising therapeutic target, but how it should be modulated depends on the disease types and sex differences. For example, MerTK inhibition emerges as a new strategy for cancer therapy due to it counteracts effect on anti-tumor immunity, while MerTK restoration represents a promising treatment for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction as MerTK is cleaved in these disease conditions.\nGraphical abstract\nCharacteristics of MerTK receptor in human cells, tissues, and diseases. MerTK is highly expressed in immune cells, vascular cells, and stem cells, affecting the pathological process of the three most common diseases in humans, such as brain disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. MerTK expression also shows sex differences in a variety of human diseases.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies on unemployment in the G7 countries using a dynamic panel estimation approach. The analysis covers the period from 2005 to 2020 and incorporates various control variables related to unemployment rates, along with AI, big data, data science, and machine learning Google Trend Index (GTI). The ArellanoâBover/BlundellâBond (1998) system estimator is employed to ensure robust results, particularly in cases involving multiple lags of the dependent variable. The most noteworthy results highlight a negative association between AI, big data technologies, and unemployment. These technologies enhance productivity, leading to increased capital accumulation and the creation of new jobs. This validates the \"displacement effect\" for AI and big data technologies, implying that while certain jobs may be automated, the net effect is job creation. Consequently, implementing AI and big data technologies in economic processes can effectively reduce unemployment rates and boost wages by creating new job opportunities.",

The current study sought to develop a series of indices via analyses of three variables: Non-E. coli coliform (NEC) concentration, E. coli concentration, and the calculated NEC:E. coli concentration ratio. A large microbial water quality dataset comprising 1,104,094 samples collected from 292,638 Ontarian wells between 2010 and 2021 was used. Getis-Ord Gi* (Gi*), Local Moran's I (LMI), and space-time scanning were employed for index development based on identified cluster recurrence. Gi* and LMI identify hot and cold spots, i.e., spatially proximal subregions with similarly high or low contamination magnitudes. Indices were statistically compared with mapped well density and age-adjusted enteric infection rates (i.e., campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) enteritis) at a subregional (N = 298) resolution for evaluation and final index selection. Findings suggest that index development via Gi* represented the most efficacious approach. Developed Gi* indices exhibited no correlation with well density, implying that indices are not biased by rural population density. Gi* indices exhibited positive correlations with mapped infection rates, and were particularly associated with higher bacterial (Campylobacter, VTEC) infection rates among younger sub-populations (p < 0.05). Conversely, no association was found between developed indices and giardiasis rates, an infection not typically associated with private groundwater contamination. Findings suggest that a notable proportion of bacterial infections are associated with groundwater and that the developed Gi* index represents an appropriate spatiotemporal reflection of long-term groundwater quality. Bacterial infection correlations with the NEC:E. coli ratio index (p < 0.001) were markedly different compared to correlations with the E. coli index, implying that the ratio may supplement E. coli monitoring as a groundwater assessment metric capable of elucidating contamination mechanisms. This study may serve as a methodological blueprint for the development of big data-based groundwater contamination indices across the globe.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (251KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

By analyzing the limitations of current financial risk assessment methods, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework based on random forests. The performance of a financial enterprise risk assessment system based on random forest was evaluated through four experiments in the experimental stage. Through systematic comparative experiments, it was found that the random forest method showed better performance compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, with an accuracy of 92%, SVM at 85%, recall index at 90%, better than SVM at 82%, and F1 score of 91%, higher than SVM at 83%. In the multi scenario risk assessment experiment, the accuracy of random forest in conventional market scenarios is 85%, the recall rate is 80%, and the F1 score is 82%. In real-time data evaluation experiments, the accuracy of the model gradually increased from the initial 85% to 95% at 10 different time points. The above experimental data results collectively confirm that systems based on random forests have strong adaptability and efficient risk assessment capabilities in diverse financial environments.",

Measurement and evaluation of the level of quality are crucial to determining whether data can be used for the tasks at hand. Conscientious of this importance, industry and academia have proposed several data quality measurements and assessment frameworks over the last two decades. Unfortunately, there is no common and shared vocabulary for data quality terms. Thus, it is difficult and time-consuming to integrate data quality analysis within a (Big) Data workflow for performing Artificial Intelligence tasks. One of the main reasons is that, except for a reduced number of proposals, the presented vocabularies are neither machine-readable nor processable, needing human processing to be incorporated.\nObjective:\nThis paper proposes a unified data quality measurement and assessment information model. This model can be used in different environments and contexts to describe data quality measurement and evaluation concerns.\nMethod:\nThe model has been developed as an ontology to make it interoperable and machine-readable. For better interoperability and applicability, this ontology, BIGOWL4DQ, has been developed as an extension of a previously developed ontology for describing knowledge management in Big Data analytics.\nConclusions:\nThis extended ontology provides a data quality measurement and assessment framework required when designing Artificial Intelligence workflows and integrated reasoning capacities. Thus, BIGOWL4DQ can be used to describe Big Data analysis and assess the data quality before the analysis.\nResult:\nOur proposal has been validated with two use cases. First, the semantic proposal has been assessed using an academic use case. And second, a real-world case study within an Artificial Intelligence workflow has been conducted to endorse our work.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nGuzheng tune progression involves intricately harmonizing melodic motif transitions. Effectively navigating this vast creative possibility space to expose musically consistent elaborations presents challenges. We develop a specialized large long short-term memory (LSTM) model for generating musically consistent Guzheng tune transitions. First, we propose novel firefly algorithm (FA) enhancements, e.g., adaptive diversity preservation and adaptive swim parameters, to boost exploration effectiveness for navigating the vast creative combinatorics when generating Guzheng tune transitions. Then, we develop a specialized stacked LSTM architecture incorporating residual connections and conditioned embedding vectors that can leverage long-range temporal dependencies in Guzheng music patterns, including unsupervised learning of concise Guzheng-specific melody embedding vectors via a variational autoencoder, encapsulating unique harmonic signatures from performance descriptors to provide style guidance. Finally, we use LSTM networks to develop adversarial generative large models that enable realistic synthesis and evaluation of Guzheng tunes switching. We gather an extensive 10+ hour corpus of solo Guzheng recordings spanning 230 musical pieces, 130 distinguished performing artists, and 600+ audio tracks. Simultaneously, we conduct thorough Guzheng data analysis. Comparative assessments against strong baselines over systematic musical metrics and professional listeners validate significant generation fidelity improvements. Our model achieves a 63 % reduction in reconstruction error compared to the standard FA optimization after 1000 iterations. It also outperforms baselines in capturing characteristic motifs, maintaining modality coherence with under 2 % dissonant pitch errors, and retaining desired rhythmic cadences. User studies further confirm the superior naturalness, novelty, and stylistic faithfulness of the generated tune transitions, with ratings close to real data.",

This paper explores the impact of complex traffic situations on maritime safety, focusing on inland waterway traffic. It presents a big data analytics method, utilizing data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and historical maritime accident records. The methodology involves AIS data preprocessing and spatial autocorrelation models, including Moran's index, to extract and evaluate the dynamic characteristics of maritime traffic. The analysis of traffic characteristic includes a thorough investigation into the spatial-temporal distribution of ship average speed and trajectory density. The paper then introduces an effective traffic characteristic analysis model that evaluates the relationship between maritime traffic patterns and accidents. The study, specifically targeting the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River, reveals variations in ship trajectory density and average speed over time. It identifies several hotspots with a significant local correlation between these factors. Moreover, a substantial correlation is found between the locations of maritime accidents and areas with increased ship trajectory density and average speed. These results may provide insights for traffic safety management and highlight strategies for preventing maritime accidents.",

The method is based on the theory of spectral neighborhood of the soil line (SNSL) and the technology of constructing a multitemporal soil line (MSL). The method is based on the processing of big remote sensing data (BRSD) from 1984 to 2023. Filtering of BRSD and detection of bare soil surface (BSS) is carried out on the basis of neural networks. The method was implemented for BSS with an area about of 79,000 ha with a spatial resolution of 30 m in the Mtsensk district (Oryol Oblast, Russia). Verification was provided by four independent field surveys (which were carried out using three various methods) in different years (2022â2023). The regression is described by a polynomial of degree 2. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the regression was 0.8. The proposed method can be widely used for mapping of SOM in the areas of transition from leached chernozems (Luvic Chernozems) to sod-podzolic (Albic Retisol) and gray forest (Luvic Phaeozems) soils or in similar nature conditions.",

This paper aims to develop a drug cold chain transportation risk assessment and early warning system based on big data, utilizing advanced technologies such as big data analysis and machine learning to achieve real-time monitoring, intelligent analysis, and early warning of various risk factors in the drug cold chain transportation process. This paper proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes data collection layer, data transmission layer, data processing and storage layer, analysis engine, warning and response module, user interface, and system integration interface. This paper collects key environmental data in real-time through sensors, such as temperature and humidity, and uses a secure data transmission layer to transmit the data to the central processing system. The construction of the risk assessment model is based on a series of quantifiable risk indicators, including temperature deviation, humidity deviation, location deviation, etc., and through data standardization and weight allocation, combined with a machine learning model to perform risk scoring and grading. The early warning mechanism implementation part includes early warning rules and threshold settings as well as real-time monitoring and dynamic warning to ensure that the system can respond to potential risks in a timely manner. The results of the system performance evaluation show that the risk evolution prediction deviation rate remains at a very low level, with a maximum of 1.4%, the false alarm rate is very low, with a maximum of 0.15% and a minimum of 0.03%, and the risk situational awareness sensitivity coefficient remains at a high level, with a minimum of 0.8. These results indicate that the developed system performs well in terms of risk prediction accuracy, warning timeliness and risk perception sensitivity.",
