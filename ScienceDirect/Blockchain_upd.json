    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo facilitate cross-domain data interaction in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), establishing trust between multiple administrative domains is essential. Although blockchain technology has been proposed as a solution, current techniques still suffer from issues related to efficiency, security, and privacy. Our research aims to address these challenges by proposing a lightweight, trusted data interaction scheme based on blockchain, which reduces redundant interactions among entities. We enhance the traditional Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm to support lightweight distributed consensus in large-scale IIoT scenarios. Introducing a composite digital signature algorithm and incorporating veto power minimizes resource consumption and eliminates ineffective consensus operations. The experimental results show that, compared with PBFT, our scheme reduces latency by 27.2%, thereby improving communication efficiency and resource utilization. Furthermore, we develop a lightweight authentication technique specifically for cross-domain IIoT, leveraging blockchain technology to achieve distributed collaborative authentication. The performance comparisons indicate that our method significantly outperforms traditional schemes, with an average authentication latency of approximately 151 milliseconds. Additionally, we introduce a trusted federated learning (FL) algorithm that ensures comprehensive trust assessments for devices across different domains while protecting data privacy. Extensive simulations and experiments validate the reliability of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has gained traction in Food Supply Chain Management (FSCM), enhancing traceability and transparency. Existing deployments of public or private blockchains face issues in achieving an optimal balance between transparency and decentralization. This work proposed a hybrid blockchain model complemented by an Access Control (AC) mechanism to bolster security, reliability, and usability within FSCM systems. Furthermore, the integration of a recommender system is proposed to utilize data analytics and machine learning for personalizing product offerings and optimizing inventory management, aiming to boost efficiency and consumer satisfaction. The synergy between the hybrid blockchain framework and the recommender system is anticipated to cultivate a more engaged, efficient, and gratified supply chain ecosystem. The model significantly enhances monitoring in 30% of the use cases and supports transparency in a quarter of them. It also reduces vulnerability cases by 20%. Inventory management is markedly improved, reducing overstock by 25%, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid blockchain approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe immutability is a crucial property for blockchain applications, however, it also leads to problems such as the inability to revise illegal data on the blockchain and delete private data. Although redactable blockchains enable on-chain modification, they suffer from inefficiency and excessive centralization, the majority of redactable blockchain schemes ignore the difficult problems of traceability and consistency check. In this paper, we present a Dynamically Redactable Blockchain based on decentralized Chameleon hash (DRBC). Specifically, we propose an Identity-Based Decentralized Chameleon Hash (IDCH) and a Version-Based Transaction structure (VT) to realize the traceability of transaction modifications in a decentralized environment. Then, we propose an efficient block consistency check protocol based on the Bloom filter tree, which can realize the consistency check of transactions with extremely low time and space cost. Security analysis and experiment results demonstrate the reliability of DRBC and its significant advantages in a decentralized environment.",

Nonetheless, consumers often seek supplementary information from diverse sources. The inconsistent or conflicting information across these sources can complicate the process of making sustainable consumption decisions. Prior studies lack an understanding of how blockchain transparency and information-seeking shape individual decision-making regarding sustainable consumption. In this study, building on signaling theory, we have developed a model to understand how blockchain transparency and the consumers' information-seeking tendencies may reduce sustainable product uncertainty. To analyze our research model, first, we conducted five focus group interviews with 21 participants to understand their information needs while making sustainable consumption decisions in the context of the fashion apparel industry. The results of the focus groups helped us craft a scenario and user interface (UI) for a novel blockchain-based app for sustainable consumption. We then collected data from 282 European consumers and examined direct path coefficients and indirect moderated mediation effects. The findings highlight that blockchain transparency affects the trustworthiness of product sustainability and improves consumer satisfaction, which in turn reduces sustainable product uncertainty. The relationship between blockchain transparency and satisfaction is reduced by information-seeking. This finding implies that the consumers' experience of blockchain transparency in terms of enhanced satisfaction is not always consistent and instead depends on their inclination to seek information.",

This paper establishes two-stage Stackelberg game models treating the usage level of blockchain technology as an endogenous variable for semiconductor chip supply chains consisting of a single manufacturer and a single retailer, considering consumer preferences, decision-makersâ risk attitudes, technological enhancement cost, and additional testing cost. This study expands the application of blockchain technology, game models that treat the usage level of blockchain technology as an exogenous variable, and those that only address the design of single-type cost-sharing contracts. This paper further explores the blockchain technology adoption mechanism from the aspects of the optimal usage level of blockchain technology or enhancement level of information disclosure, pricing strategy, and utility profit. The results indicate when the semiconductor chip manufacturer bears the technological enhancement cost alone, the adoption of blockchain technology improves the information disclosure level, increase the market demand, and reduce the downstream testing demand, enhancing overall profitability. The fixed-ratio cost-sharing contract for additional testing does not prove effective. However, when the semiconductor chip retailer falls below a certain threshold, the fixed-ratio cost-sharing contract for technological enhancement further enhances the usage level of blockchain technology and overall profitability, fostering a win-win scenario.",

To model inter-organizational SOC systems, Choreography modeling languages emerged to represent the distributed coordination among the involved organizations. From the realization perspective, blockchain technology is emerging as a promising run-time supporting peer-to-peer communication without the need for a central coordinator, thanks to its intrinsic security, trust and decentralization characteristics. However, while blockchain can bring many advantages, technological barriers still limit its adoption in organizations, due to the costly and time-consuming learning process. For this reason, we propose RESTChain, a framework enabling in an automatic way the interactions that take place among the participants in a service choreography exploiting blockchain technology. Starting from a choreography specification, the framework provides a set of Mediators and automatically generates a Smart Contract that coordinates the service interactions. The mediators are software components that are directly connected with the smart contracts and expose REST APIs in compliance with the role played by the organizations in the choreography. In this way, the services deployed by one organization can communicate with the services made available by another organization through the blockchain, in a secure and transparent manner. The proposed approach has been implemented on the Layer 2 Polygon blockchain and has been validated on a Market Retail case study analyzing its efficiency in terms of costs and times.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (190KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This raises the question of when do firms adopt blockchains and do blockchains benefit supply chains. To answer this, we examine a dyadic supply chain consisting of a buyer and a supplier and analyze their traceability effort and pricing decisions. Our results show that the demand-side, supply-side and reputational factors influencing blockchain adoption are primarily complementary and in the absence of one of them, firms can still adopt blockchain. Furthermore, even in the absence of individual benefits for a supply chain partner, there exist conditions under which blockchain adoption benefits the supply chain that can incentivize players to join blockchain. Overall, we contribute by offering a framework that supply chain players can use to assess the likelihood of blockchain implementation success or failure and address the challenges pertaining to incentives and cost imbalances in blockchain implementation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning (ML) has been increasingly adopted to solve engineering problems with performance gauged by accuracy, efficiency, and security. Notably, blockchain technology (BT) has been added to ML when security is a particular concern. Nevertheless, there is a research gap that prevailing solutions focus primarily on data security using blockchain but ignore computational security, making the traditional ML process vulnerable to off-chain risks. Therefore, the research objective is to develop a novel ML on blockchain (MLOB) framework to ensure both the data and computational process security. The central tenet is to place them both on the blockchain, execute them as blockchain smart contracts, and protect the execution records on-chain. The framework is established by developing a prototype and further calibrated using a case study of industrial inspection. It is shown that the MLOB framework, compared with existing ML and BT isolated solutions, is superior in terms of security (successfully defending against corruption on six designed attack scenario), maintaining accuracy (0.01% difference with baseline), albeit with a slightly compromised efficiency (0.231 second latency increased). The key finding is MLOB can significantly enhances the computational security of engineering computing without increasing computing power demands. This finding can alleviate concerns regarding the computational resource requirements of MLâBT integration. With proper adaption, the MLOB framework can inform various novel solutions to achieve computational security in broader engineering challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe redactable blockchain provides the editability of blocks, which guarantees the data immutability of blocks while removing illegal content on the blockchain. However, the existing redactable blockchain relies on trusted assumptions regarding a single editing authority. Ateniese et al. (EuroS&P 2017) and Li et al. (TIFS 2023) proposed solutions by using threshold chameleon hash functions, but these lack accountability for malicious editing. This paper delves into this problem and proposes an accountability weight threshold blockchain editing scheme. Specifically, we first formalize the model of a redactable blockchain with accountability. Then, we introduce the novel concept of the Accountable Weight Threshold Chameleon Hash Function (AWTCH). This function collaboratively generates a chameleon hash trapdoor through a weight committee protocol, where only sets of committees meeting the weight threshold can edit data. Additionally, it incorporates a tracer to identify and hold accountable any disputing editors, thus enabling supervision of editing rights. We propose a generic construction for AWTCH. Then, we introduce an efficient construction of AWTCH and develop a redactable blockchain scheme by leveraging AWTCH. Finally, we demonstrate our schemeâs practicality. The editing efficiency of our scheme is twice that of Tian et al. (TIFS 2023) with the same number of editing blocks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn complementing our existing knowledge of blockchain technology adoption in the construction industry, this research investigated how the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) applies to adopting blockchain technology among Saudi Arabian Construction companies. This study utilized cross-sectional data collection, causal research design, a quantitative research approach, and a simple random sampling technique to collect data from 248 Saudi Arabian construction companies. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was utilized to analyze the data. The results showed that attitude toward adopting Blockchain (ATT) and perceived ease of use (PEU) are good predictors of behavioural intention to adopt Blockchain. The findings showed that when construction companies perceive the ease of use of Blockchain, they intend to adopt the technology. Attitude toward adopting Blockchain, directly and indirectly, influences behavioural intention to adopt the Technology. However, top management support only directly leads to intention once the companies perceive the usefulness of blockchain technology. This paper complements the existing literature on adopting Blockchain in the Saudi Arabian construction industry. The study provides insight into the influence of top management support, attitude toward adoption, and perceived ease of use in the blockchain adoption process.",

In our study, we present a novel approach to identifying sustainability-focused blockchain companies and relate their level of engagement to location factors and entrepreneurial ecosystem embeddedness. For this, we use a large-scale web scraping approach to analyze the textual content and hyperlink networks of all US companies from their websites. Our results show that blockchain remains a niche technology, with its use communicated by about 0.6% of US companies. However, the proportion of blockchain companies that are committed to sustainability is significantly higher than in the overall firm population. Additionally, we find that such sustainability-engaged blockchain companies have, at least quantitatively, a more intensive embedding in entrepreneurial ecosystems, while infrastructural and socio-economic location factors hardly play a role.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nClients' influence remains a significant issue in the property valuation industry, particularly in emerging countries like Nigeria, where existing solutions have proven ineffective. This study, therefore, considers blockchain technology as a medium for delivering information transparency and explores the application of a blockchain-based tool for reducing clients' influence in property valuation. Specifically, this study is pioneering in proposing, developing, and testing a blockchain-based solution for reducing client influence in property valuation, suggesting a promising avenue for increasing transparency in the process. This study involves several stages. Firstly, propchain, a blockchain-based mobile application, was developed and deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric Network, a permissioned blockchain network. The efficacy of the proposed solution was qualitatively tested by a single-round focus group held with valuers, bankers, and a loan customer who used the application to simulate a property valuation exercise for a mortgage. The findings suggest that blockchain technology could be a viable tool for reducing client influence in property valuations. However, specific challenges in the Nigerian context, such as data access, information verification, and stakeholder trust, present significant obstacles. These issues highlight the need for robust institutional support systems to enhance the efficacy of blockchain solutions in this domain. This study supports Levy and Schuck's (2005) assertion that increased information transparency can reduce client influence. Nevertheless, our research indicates that the successful implementation of blockchain in property valuation will require overcoming systemic barriers unique to the Nigerian environment. The implication of key findings is also discussed.",

Despite its importance, the mining industry is mired with challenges of supply chain traceability, transparency, corruption, inefficiencies, data loss, etc., all of which create the need for innovative solutions involving emerging technologies that can streamline these processes and enhance their reliability. Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to address most of these challenges in an effective manner. This study looks at the feasibility of utilising Blockchain technology for the management of Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan, which faces similar issues, including lack of trust between stakeholders, corruption, sustainability problems, environmental degradation, and a legal battle. This qualitative study used six semi-structured interviews of stakeholders in Pakistan who had knowledge of the potential of Blockchain technology for the management of the Reko Diq project. The key themes that were identified in the study include Relations between Stakeholders, Environmental and Economic Sustainability, and Infrastructure Limitations. The Technology Acceptance Model was applied to the study, and the findings of the study support one tenet of the model - perceived usefulness; however, perceived ease of use was not supported. The Blockchain Screening Tool was also used to assess the feasibility of Blockchain implementation for the Reko Diq project. The findings indicate that the Reko Diq project is an ideal candidate for Blockchain implementation to enhance trust, transparency and credibility of the project.",

    "abstract": "In blockchain-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems, the length of a block affects the performance of the blockchain. The transmission performance of blocks in the form of finite character segments is also affected by the block length. Therefore, it is crucial to balance the transmission performance and blockchain performance of blockchain communication systems, especially in wireless environments involving UAVs. This paper investigates a secure transmission scheme for blocks in blockchain-based UAV communication systems to prevent the information contained in blocks from being completely eavesdropped during transmission. In our scheme, using a friendly jamming UAV to emit jamming signals diminishes the quality of the eavesdropping channel, thus enhancing the communication security performance of the source UAV. Under the constraints of maneuverability and transmission power of the UAV, the joint design of UAV trajectories, transmission power, and block length are proposed to maximize the average minimum secrecy rate (AMSR). Since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, we first decompose the optimization problem into subproblems of trajectory optimization, transmission power optimization, and block length optimization. Then, based on first-order approximation techniques, these subproblems are reformulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, we utilize an alternating iteration algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve these subproblems iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve secure transmission for blocks while maintaining the performance of the blockchain.",

Thus, the quality of seeds is important for ensuring sustainable food security, making seed certification critically important. However, classical seed certification systems are predominantly paper-based with limited digitisation. These systems, even digitised, are often centralised, and they face challenges related to transparency, traceability, and integrity.\nObjective\nThis study aims to investigate the practicality of blockchain technology in revitalising transparency, traceability, and integrity in the seed certification process.\nMethods\nThis study used a Design Science Research (DSR) approach to design and test a blockchain-based smart contract to improve the seed certification process. Within the DSR framework, the study used literature review and evolutionary prototyping to establish the requirements and design the prototype.\nResults and conclusions\nThe findings demonstrate the practical application of blockchain technology in improving aspects of transparency and integrity in the seed certification process. The findings further underscore that smart contracts can be leveraged efficiently to automate and enhance the seed certification process. The findings provide evidence-based frameworks for decision-makers and practitioners to justify the prioritisation of blockchain technology in designing future sustainable agricultural systems. Future studies should investigate how blockchain-based systems for seed certification can be scaled and integrated with existing agricultural systems.\nSignificance\nThis study provides both theoretical and practical contributions on application of blockchain technology in the domain of seed supply chain. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive account of the design aspects of blockchain system in the seed certification process.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (156KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

In this regard, the role of blockchain technology has garnered a lot of attention among practitioners as well as academia. Blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature ensures trustworthy data sharing, real-time tracking, and enhanced cybersecurity. However, adoption in emerging markets has not been as fast as in developed countries. There has been little clarity as to what the drivers and barriers to its adoption are, and what role governments and academia should play in the process. The present study addresses these issues using a qualitative study that utilizes data obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with blockchain companies and supply chain companies in Latin America. Results show that the main barriers are 1) low knowledge about blockchain, 2) insufficient information, connectivity, and financial infrastructure, 3) lack of clear regulation, 4) a scarce presence of a local market for entrepreneurs to produce blockchain applications. It is also interesting to find that in contrast to lack of skilled manpower in many emerging economies globally, Latin America has skilled human capital for blockchain adoption. Thus, emerging markets need to foster collaborative work between companies, government, and academia to overcome these barriers and be able to enjoy blockchain benefits while increasing competitiveness in supply chains.",

To address this, conventional approaches have relied on database indexing techniques applied to each individual replica copy of a blockchain. However, this only partially addresses the problem, because if the index is not distributed it is not available for devices in the blockchain network. If an index is to be incorporated and distributed within blockchain, the unique attribute of immutability necessitates a more innovative approach. To that end, we propose an Enhanced Append-only Skip List (EASL). This specialised indexing technique utilises binary search with skip lists in blockchain, resulting in a sublinear cost for data retrieval. The EASL indexing technique is maintained by each newly appended blockchain block and offers enhanced readability and robustness using an explicitly recorded index structure. Our proposed technique is 42% more efficient in computing and 60% more efficient in storage consumption than its predecessor, the Deterministic Append-only Skip List (DASL) indexing technique. This is achieved through agile data retrieval, resulting in energy cost savings from less computational effort to maintain the index, and less network bandwidth to retrieve blockchain data. The code for the proposed technique is publicly available on GitHub {https://github.com/jarednewell/EASL/}, to expedite future research and encourage the practical application of this effectual data index.",

While sensor-based devices have simplified many aspects of daily life, these advancements also face significant security challenges, particularly in safeguarding patient information. In response, this research introduces a novel blockchain-based hybrid chaotic encryption and authentication for maintaining EHR transmissions aimed at robust and secure authentication within HealthCare 4.0. The complete framework incorporates the Infura Web API, using Python 3.19. To strengthen authentication security, modified Hippopotamus-evoked scroll maps are used to generate dynamic hashes in the genesis block formation, securing all EHR data in the proposed architecture. This entire framework was evaluated on the Ethereum Blockchain, leveraging Web 3.0, with Python 3.19 serving as the core programming environment for interface development. Security analysis was performed utilizing Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, while the framework's resilience was rigorously tested against NIST standards. Comparative testing highlights the model's superior defense capabilities against various attacks, surpassing other frameworks in complexity and robustness. The findings ultimately provide a comprehensive view of the optimized encryption scheme on blockchain technology and the future pathways for secure authentication frameworks in HealthCare 4.0.",

Current strategies, which rely on centralized systems for peer-to-peer interactions, face issues of scalability, security, traceability, single points of failure, and privacy. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, offers immutability, transparency, automation, and scalability as potential solutions. However, practical implementation remains challenging. This study systematically reviews 156 studies published since 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to explore these limitations. Results highlight that selecting the appropriate blockchain platform and consensus mechanism is crucial. Observations show that 42% of studies proposing new consensus methods and 46% developing new platforms or using simulations struggle with practical implementation. In contrast, leveraging existing standard blockchain platforms and consensus mechanisms enhances practicality and scalability. Additionally, seamless interoperability with Internet of Things (IoT) remains a significant challenge due to the high costs associated with the few platforms that offer this feature. Standardization of blockchain methodology, interoperability, performance measurement, and governance remains a major issue despite several parallel efforts by multiple stakeholders, including blockchain platform providers. Consolidation of these efforts into a common framework, together with the utilization of existing blockchain components, is key to resolving current limitations and fostering wider adoption. Among the various blockchain components suited for different applications, this study provides key criteria for selection, guiding the development of practical and scalable blockchain-based energy applications.",

This study provides an overview of blockchain applications in logistics management, employing a comprehensive theoretical framework. Blockchain is considered a critical digital infrastructure for logistics operations due to its distinctive characteristics, including decentralization, transparency, immutability, real-time information sharing, reliability, and end-to-end visibility. These characteristics address many contemporary logistics challenges. The study introduces a research model that integrates the fit-viability model (FVM) and task technology fit theory (TTF), demonstrating blockchain's suitability for enhancing logistics operational functions and sustainability performance. To validate the model, data were collected from logistics managers of 576 companies and analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. This research offers valuable insights for managers, policymakers, and decision-makers on practical challenges and potential solutions in logistics through the application of blockchain. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the implementation of blockchain can improve the alignment, resilience, transparency, integration, and sustainability of logistics tasks.",

    "abstract": "The advent of blockchain technology has transformed traditional methods of information exchange, shifting reliance from centralized data centers to decentralized frameworks. While blockchainâs decentralization and security are strengths, traditional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) face limitations in scalability. PoW achieves decentralization and security but struggles with scalability as transaction volumes grow, while PoS enhances scalability, but risks centralization due to monopolization by high-stake participants. Sharding, a recent advancement in blockchain technology, addresses scalability by partitioning the network into shards that process transactions independently, thereby improving throughput and reducing latency. However, cross-shard communication, essential for transactions involving multiple shards, introduces challenges in coordination and fault tolerance. This research introduces a shard-based hybrid consensus model, PoSW, which combines PoW and PoS to mitigate the limitations of both mechanisms. By integrating PoWâs fairness with PoSâs scalability in a shard-based blockchain, the proposed model addresses key issues of scalability and monopolization. We evaluate the model against state-of-the-art consensus algorithms, including Monoxide and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). The results show that the proposed PoSW model reduces communication overhead compared to PBFT and improves resource utilization over Monoxide. In addition to performance gains, the security analysis demonstrates that the PoSW model provides robust defense against common blockchain attacks such as the 51% and Sybil attacks, etc. The proposed approach is particularly suited for applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply chain management, which require both high scalability and robust security. The contributions of this research include the development of the PoSW hybrid consensus mechanism, its comparative evaluation with leading algorithms, and a thorough security analysis. These contributions represent a significant step forward in addressing blockchainâs scalability, fairness, and security challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology is increasingly recognized as a transformative tool for enhancing clarity and responsibility in the organic food supply chain, where concerns about product authenticity and safety are paramount. By offering provable and translucent information about the origination, production processes, and administration of organic items, blockchain helps to reduce information asymmetry and builds consumer trust, which is critical for purchase decisions in the organic food market. Drawing on insights from the trust theory and the stimulus-organism-response framework, this study uses a moderated mediation model to explore how technology anxiety negatively moderates the direct and indirect influences of blockchain-based food traceability systems on trust in organic food products and organic food purchase intention. Using a targeted sample of 5326 consumers in Vietnam, the PROCESS macro approach (models 8 and 4) is utilized to examine the formulated hypotheses. The results demonstrate that blockchain-based food traceability systems notably enhance consumer trust in organic food products and their intention to buy these products. Trust in organic food products serves as a mediator in the connection between blockchain-based traceability and purchase intention, while technology anxiety weakens the positive impacts of blockchain technology on trust and purchase intention when anxiety levels are high. This research makes crucial contributions to the literature by offering a mechanism-based explanation of how blockchain technology enhances consumer trust in organic food products and integrates technological anxiety as a moderator, providing a deeper understanding of how technological innovations shape consumer behavior. In light of the findings, several critical recommendations have been proposed for practitioners and policymakers.",

This complexity not only reduces the profits for farmers but also affects the overall transparency and efficiency of the supply chain. This study aims to em-ploy blockchain technology to transform the traditional agri-food supply chain in Bangladesh, focusing on increasing transparency, enhancing efficiency, and improving profitability for farmers, thus potentially bolstering the entire agri-food ecosystem in the country. The research involves setting up a blockchain-based smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain network. This approach guarantees that all transactions within the agri-food supply chain are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Additionally, the study develops a web application to facilitate user interaction with the smart contract, enhancing accessibility and usability. Performance analysis and testing of the implemented smart con-tract demonstrate its capability to handle a significant volume of transactions without compromising on performance. The solution effectively reduces the dependency on intermediaries, thereby increasing the profit margins for the farm-ers involved. The integration of blockchain technology in the agri-food supply chain has shown promising results in enhancing transparency and efficiency. It lays a solid foundation for future improvements and suggests a scalable model that could be applied to other sectors within the country to further enhance agricultural practices and economic growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nGlobal market competitiveness and standards are pushing the manufacturing supply chain to adopt sustainable approaches to enhance quality, reduce waste, improve environmental practices, and optimize product costs. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising tool for improving supply chain transparency and manufacturing sustainability. However, various challenges to the mainstream use of blockchain must be identified and addressed. In this regard, the study aims to identify and comprehend the challenges of adopting blockchain technology in the manufacturing sector to improve sustainable standards. To bridge this gap, the study used a three-step procedure. First, through a comprehensive literature review, 19 potential challenges were identified. Then, with the experts' discussion, a total of 18 challenges were finalized. In the second phase, data was collected from 15 professionals with industrial backgrounds. Lastly, the collected data was analyzed using Combined Compromise Solution methodologies and the Fuzzy-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL). This hybrid methodology prioritizes the challenges in blockchain adoption and categorizes them into causal groups. This improves the decision-making process by evaluating how the mutual impact of challenges in blockchain adoption affects achieving sustainability in the manufacturing supply chain. The outcomes of the presented work are validated through a sensitivity analysis of the outranked dimensions of blockchain adoption challenges. Results show that 'High Initial Investment Cost' and 'Lack of Digital Skillsâ are the top challenges in its adoption. The findings of this work provide a roadmap to make the manufacturing supply chain sustainable and accomplish sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has introduced digitalization and intelligence to the industrial field. However, the terminal in IIoT has a low computing power and limited storage resources, thus it is necessary to calculate and unload the data generated by the terminal and to allocate resources. Aiming to resolve the issues of computation offloading and resource allocation in IIoT, a blockchain-assisted data communication and computing service strategy of IIoT was constructed in this study. First, a blockchain-assisted computing and communication resource allocation model in IIoT was established, which embeds resource allocation and computation offloading into a block-chain to ensure the credibility of data during the process. In order to find the minimum value of the weighted sum of system energy cost, as well as the delay in blockchain-assisted resource allocation and computation offloading, a Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm(p-JAVA) based on blockchain resource allocation was proposed, which was embedded into the blockchain system to ensure the security of the data when allocating resources. Simultaneously, Levy flight was used to modify the algorithm to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. The simulation results demonstrated that the Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm consumed 21% of the energy compared with the genetic algorithm, and 17.7% energy compared with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The load balancing ability of the Levy flight-enhanced JAYA optimization algorithm is relative to the particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms, which significantly increases the energy and delay consumption in the resource allocation of IIoT and improves the system performance.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables data owners in the Internet of Things (IoT) to collaborate in training models without sharing private data, creating new business opportunities for building a data market. However, in practical operation, there are still some problems with federated learning applications. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, distribution, and security. The blockchain-enabled federated learning further improve the security and performance of model training, while also expanding the application scope of federated learning. Blockchain has natural financial attributes that help establish a federated learning data market. However, the data of federated learning tasks may be distributed across a large number of resource-constrained IoT devices, which have different computing, communication, and storage resources, and the data quality of each device may also vary. Therefore, how to effectively select the clients with the data required for federated learning task is a research hotspot. In this paper, a two-stage client selection scheme for blockchain-enabled federated learning is proposed, which first selects clients that satisfy federated learning task through attribute-based encryption, protecting the attribute privacy of clients. Then blockchain nodes select some clients for local model aggregation by proximal policy optimization algorithm. Experiments show that the model performance of our two-stage client selection scheme is higher than that of other client selection algorithms when some clients are offline and the data quality is poor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has garnered substantial interest due to its capacity to transform numerous industries by amplifying transparency and bolstering security measures. Despite the increasing interest, there is a void in existing literature regarding the alignment of actors with the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) principles in the context of blockchain adoption. This gap restricts comprehension of the factors influencing adoption. This research addresses this void by investigating how actors align with the DOI principles in making decisions about blockchain adoption. The DOI model is combined with the innovation translation concept derived from Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore these complex dynamics in more detail. The results indicate that the decision-making process for blockchain adoption corresponds to the knowledge, persuasion, and decision stages, mirroring the phases found in the innovation translation approach. This research offers theoretical insights and practical knowledge that can be beneficial to individuals and organisations looking to promote the successful implementation of blockchain technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe issue surrounding the nature and function of smart contracts in the context of legal relationships has garnered significant attention from the European and national legislators, regulatory bodies and legal scholarship. Sections I and II of this essay give an account of the results of the ongoing doctrinal debate, which is not univocal. The objective is to provide an assessment of both the advantages and limitations associated with smart legal contracts. In Section III, the authors introduce a novel negotiation process termed \"contracts on chain\". This process enables parties to engage in negotiations, formalize agreements and execute contracts directly on the blockchain. Consequently, this negotiation approach serves as a potential bridge between the realms of Web 2 and Web 3. Further, it offers a user experience akin to online contracts but benefits from the inherent capabilities of third-generation blockchains. Albeit on-chain contracts can be deployed on both private and public blockchains, the authors express a preference for their use on the public blockchain within a \"logical platform\". This choice allows to enhance regulatory compliance and mitigate the effects of decentralization on liability regimes, while simultaneously optimizing the efficiency gains of public blockchains. Notably, this approach ensures a level of protection commensurate with that offered by private blockchains. The ultimate goal of this innovative process is to streamline the ongoing technological transition and cultivate greater trust within the market for emerging technologies.",

Adopting the lens from the stimulus-organism-response theory, this research draws a moderated mediation model to explore the direct and indirect impacts of blockchain-enabled food traceability system on organic food purchase behavior underlying a moderated mediation mechanism of blockchain knowledge and trust in the organic food chain. The PROCESS macro was approached using a purposive sample of 5,326 consumers in Vietnam to test the formulated hypotheses. The findings reveal that blockchain-enabled traceability significantly enhances trust in the organic food chain, which in turn positively influences organic food purchase behavior. Additionally, the study identifies blockchain knowledge as a crucial moderating factor, amplifying the direct and indirect effects of the traceability system on trust and purchase behavior. The study offers significant contributions to the literature by extending the application of the SOR model to technology-mediated environments and highlighting the role of consumer knowledge in moderating technology adoption outcomes. Some practical implications for practitioners are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo protect user privacy and data security, the integration of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain has become an emerging research hotspot. However, the limited throughput and high communication complexity of traditional blockchains limit their application in large-scale FL tasks, and the synchronous traditional FL will also reduce the training efficiency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain-enabled generalized Federated Dropout (FD) learning strategy, which could improve the efficiency of FL while ensuring the model generalization. Specifically, the DAG maintained by multiple edge servers will guarantee the security and traceability of the data, and the Reputation-based Tips Selection Algorithm (RTSA) is proposed to reduce the blockchain consensus delay. Second, the semi-asynchronous training among Intelligent Devices (IDs) is adopted to improve the training efficiency, and a reputation-based FD technology is proposed to prevent overfitting of the model. In addition, a Hybrid Optimal Resource Allocation (HORA) algorithm is introduced to minimize the network delay. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study addresses integrating blockchain technology into lightweight devices, specifically clustered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Integrating blockchain into the WSNs solves the problems of heterogeneity, data integrity, and data confidentiality. However, no blockchain integration considers network lifetime in WSNs. This research focuses on developing a permissioned blockchain system that incorporates a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Authority (PoA) within clustered WSNs with two main features. The first feature is to enhance the network lifetime by introducing a rotational selection of block proposers using an Energy-Aware PoA (EA-PoA) weighting mechanism. Known as the Multi-Level Blockchain Model (MLBM), the subsequent feature is to create a hierarchical network model within a blockchain network. The MLBM network comprises both local and master blockchains. Each cluster inside a WSN possesses its local blockchain network. In the MLBM, the local blockchain creates a block on the main blockchain by proposing the headers of every 10 blocks to improve data integrity. Each local blockchain has its leader, which can increase block production. The results show that the proposed solution can overcome traditional PoA performance and is suitable for clustered WSNs. In terms of lifetime, the EA-PoA selection method can extend the network lifetime by up to 10%. In addition, the MLBM can increase block production by up to twice each additional cluster compared to a single blockchain network used in traditional PoA.",

Moreover, it enables decentralized models of governance and thus challenges conventional governance approaches. This decentralized approach to governance may offer a more inclusive and participative structure but also demands substantial adaptability. This study, therefore, explored the governance dilemmas faced by enterprises adopting blockchain solutions and seeks to develop an evidence-based set of governance guidelines. Drawing on design science methodology, we studied a highly diverse set of (enterprise-driven) blockchain ecosystems using interviews, documentation, and participant observation. Based on a set of design propositions synthesized from the literature and data collected, we subsequently created and tested an extensive guideline for guiding the journey to decentralization. The resulting guideline, called GOBLET, is characterized by enterprise-centricity, stage-specific guidance, interdependencies between various blockchain layers, and pivotal behavioral drivers. Our study contributes to the literature on blockchain governance by presenting a guideline that helps practitioners create effective governance arrangements for blockchain ecosystems. The underlying design propositions can inform future theoretical work in this area.",

Using thematic analysis, 880 factors are identified and grouped into 29 themes, which offer a comprehensive overview of the literature. Using statistical analysis, the identified factors are dissected into technological (T), organisational (O), and environmental (E) dimensions (the TOE framework). Themes are further classified as barriers (B), enablers (En), and ambiguous (A) to describe a firm's readiness for blockchain adoption (the BEnA framework). We emphasise the multidimensionality of adoption factors across the TOE dimensions and the conditionality of adoption enablers across the BEnA dimensions. Analysis of research trends shows that recent blockchain adoption literature has focused on elaborating upon existing research themes (involution) rather than on developing new themes (evolution). Based on our analyses, we propose future research directions, including scrutinising the interdependence and multidimensionality of blockchain adoption factors, further examining factors with conditional or unclear effects on adoption, and broadening the contextual, temporal, and theoretical aspects of blockchain adoption research.",

Amidst the ongoing digitization of economies and societies, blockchain holds promise for addressing unresolved challenges. However, current research on this topic primarily consists of either abstract conceptual work or case studies. To bridge this gap, our study conducts a systematic literature review, aiming to comprehensively explore and structure the realm of blockchain and its impact on international trade. Key research questions explored include: What role do blockchain innovations play in facilitating trade within GVC? Additionally, what are the primary barriers hindering the adoption of blockchain innovations in trade within GVC? Our main contribution lies in categorizing these applications into five distinct categories: Trade Documents; Trade Finance; Trusted Real-Time Information Sharing; Provenance; and Sustainable GVC. Contrary to portraying blockchain innovations as a panacea or universal solution, our findings highlight the technologiesâ potential rather as a core technological infrastructure when integrated with complementary technologies such as the Internet of Things. Moreover, we identify 11 significant barriers to blockchain adoption in international trade, underscoring the need for concerted efforts to address them. From these insights, we derive implications for policymakers and practitioners, and propose avenues for future interdisciplinary research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTraditional Internet of Things (IoT) architectures that rely on centralized servers for data management and decision-making are vulnerable to security threats and privacy leakage. To address this issue, blockchain has been advocated for decentralized data management in a tamper-resistance, traceable, and transparent manner. However, a major issue that hinders the integration of blockchain and IoT lies in that, it is rather challenging for resource-constrained IoT devices to perform computation-intensive blockchain consensuses such as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Furthermore, the incentive mechanism of PoW pushes lightweight IoT nodes to aggregate their computing power to increase the possibility of successful block generation. Nevertheless, this eventually leads to the formation of computing power alliances, and significantly compromises the decentralization and security of BlockChain-aided IoT (BC-IoT) networks. To cope with these issues, we propose a lightweight consensus protocol for BC-IoT, called Proof-of-Trusted-Work (PoTW). The goal of the proposed consensus is to disincentivize the centralization of computing power and encourage the independent participation of lightweight IoT nodes in blockchain consensus. First, we put forth an on-chain reputation evaluation rule and a reputation chain for PoTW to enable the verifiability and traceability of nodes' reputations based on their contributions of computing power to the blockchain consensus, and we incorporate the multi-level block generation difficulty as a rewards for nodes to accumulate reputations. Second, we model the block generation process of PoTW and analyze the block throughput using the continuous time Markov chain. Additionally, we define and optimize the relative throughput gain to quantify and maximize the capability of PoTW that suppresses the computing power centralization (i.e., centralization suppression). Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the computing power of the computing power alliance and the levels of block generation difficulty on the centralization suppression capability of PoTW. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the consistency of the analytical results in terms of block throughput. In particular, the results show that PoTW effectively reduces the block generation proportion of the computing power alliance compared with PoW, while simultaneously improving that of individual lightweight nodes. This indicates that PoTW is capable of suppressing the centralization of computing power to a certain degree. Moreover, as the levels of block generation difficulty in PoTW increase, its centralization suppression capability strengthens.",

However, existing sharding blockchain protocols suffer from a high cross-shard ratio, high transaction latency, limited throughput enhancement, and high account migration. To address these problems, this paper proposes a sharding blockchain protocol for enhanced scalability and performance optimization through account transaction reconfiguration. Firstly, we construct a blockchain transaction account graph network structure to analyze transaction account correlations. Secondly, a modularity-based account transaction reconfiguration algorithm and a detailed account reconfiguration process is designed to minimize cross-shard transactions. Finally, we introduce a transaction processing mechanism for account transaction reconfiguration in parallel with block consensus uploading, which reduces the reconfiguration time overhead and system latency. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared to existing shard protocols: up to a 34.7% reduction in cross-shard transaction ratio, at least an 83.2% decrease in transaction latency, at least a 52.7% increase in throughput and a 7.8% decrease in account migration number. The proposed protocol significantly enhances the overall performance and scalability of blockchain, providing robust support for blockchain applications in various fields such as financial services, supply chain management, and industrial Internet of Things. It also enables better support for high-concurrency scenarios and large-scale network environments.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly propelled the advancement of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). With AI support, represented by machine learning technology, vehicles gain the capability to make intelligent decisions. As a distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a preferred solution in IoV. Compared to traditional centralized machine learning, FL reduces communication overhead and improves privacy protection. Despite these benefits, FL still faces some security and privacy concerns, such as poisoning attacks and inference attacks, prompting exploration into blockchain integration to enhance its security posture. This paper introduces a novel blockchain-enabled federated learning (BCFL) scheme with differential privacy (DP) tailored for IoV. In order to meet the performance demanding IoV environment, the proposed methodology integrates a consortium blockchain with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus, which offers superior efficiency over the conventional public blockchains. In addition, the proposed approach utilizes the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm in the local training process of FL for enhanced privacy protection. Experiment results indicate that the integration of blockchain elevates the security level of FL in that the proposed approach effectively safeguards FL against poisoning attacks. On the other hand, the additional overhead associated with blockchain integration is also limited to a moderate level to meet the efficiency criteria of IoV. Furthermore, by incorporating DP, the proposed approach is shown to have the (\n-\n) privacy guarantee while maintaining an acceptable level of model accuracy. This enhancement effectively mitigates the threat of inference attacks on private information.",

Blockchain networks generate a large amount of logs which capture and describe data flowing through the network in the form of transactions, blocks and events. Monitoring these blockchain data from the off-chain world is needed to detect anomalies with the aim of mitigating the risks that may arise as a result of using blockchain technology. However, the real-time monitoring of these logs by off-chain systems has become a challenge from the beginning of 2018 when the blockchain networks reached a high number of daily transactions. In this paper, we propose a portable, maintainable and easily configurable architecture integrating blockchain and complex event processing technologies that allows for both the real-time monitoring of logs generated in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain networks and the automatic detection of anomalies in these networks by matching event patterns. This architecture was tested by using vast amounts of blockchain data already publicly registered in Ethereum and Polygon networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is able to automatically detect anomalies which occur in different blockchain networks, making analytics of blockchain data possible by off-chain systems.",

While the developed blockchain information systems were promising, few have reached market entry. Indeed, blockchain consortia often lost development focus due to high system complexity and a lack of understanding of how to create a system that will serve the needs and bring value to all stakeholders. Thus, stakeholders struggled to leverage blockchain information systems' full value. Prior studies demonstrated that blockchain systems pose not only technical but also organizational challenges. Analysing six blockchain consortia, we identify their value mechanisms, organizational problems, and organizational solutions that successful blockchain consortia experience while organizing themselves for value. As a result, we propose a new organizational form, i.e., a layered organization, for blockchain consortia to achieve better value creation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn order to maintain the value of the national currency and control foreign debt, central banks are vital to the management of a nationâs foreign exchange reserves. These reserves, however, are vulnerable to a variety of hazards, including as money laundering, fraud, theft, and cyberattacks. These are issues that traditional financial systems frequently face because of their vulnerabilities and inefficiency. Using modern innovations in a blockchain-based solution can help tackle these serious issues. To protect data privacy, the Microsoft SEAL library is utilized for homomorphic encryption (FHE). For the development of smart contracts, Solidity is employed within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is leveraged to provide a scalable and powerful infrastructure to support our solution. To guarantee safe and effective transaction validation, our method incorporates a hybrid consensus process that combines Proof of Authority (PoA) with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). The administration of foreign exchange reserves by central banks is made more secure, transparent, and operationally efficient by this all-inclusive approach.",

Blockchain technology offers a promising solution for copyright protection of digital resources. However, existing copyright protection methods based on single-chain or consortium blockchains have disadvantages such as low system processing efficiency, poor scalability, and a lack of alignment with real-world business needs. To address the current challenges of blockchain technology in the field of copyright protection and establish a more effective solution for protecting digital resource copyrights, while also expanding the application of blockchain cross-chain technology and promoting its development, leveraging blockchain cross-chain theory, technology, and methods, a digital resource copyright protection scheme based on blockchain cross-chain technology was constructed. It outlines detailed processes for copyright registration, resource transactions, copyright modifications, and copyright enforcement. Furthermore, this copyright protection scheme was analyzed. The findings indicated that the blockchain cross-chain technology is suitable for digital resource copyright protection. The proposed copyright protection scheme can allow various stakeholders to better fulfill their roles, in addition to enhancing the overall maintainability and scalability of the blockchain system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSharing Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is critical for improving medical decision-making and emergency care. However, EHRs contain sensitive patient information, making data breaches and misuse a significant concern during sharing. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Blockchain-Based Secure Access and Sharing (BCAS) scheme, a patient-centered, secure, and efficient solution for large-scale EHR access and sharing that intelligently combines blockchain with proxy re-encryption. Four smart contracts are designed for the BCAS to achieve effective user identity registration, precise virtual identity verification, strict access control, and secure data management. The adoption of hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage structures, coupled with the four smart contracts, effectively optimizes the efficiency of the blockchain in BCAS. Proxy re-encryption further enhances data confidentiality and streamlines EHR sharing among authorized users. The security analysis indicates that BCAS can resist DDoS, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring the privacy and security of patient EHR data. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the CPU usage of smart contracts does not exceed 15%. The on-chain and off-chain storage structures require less than 30s for uploading and downloading an 800MB file. Additionally, the proxy re-encryption scheme can process a 10MB file in less than 43ms. These results indicate that BCAS offers efficient performance without compromising data security and privacy. Compared with existing blockchain-based EHR sharing systems, BCAS offers superior performance, a more comprehensive solution, and increased resistance to attacks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done for immutability, privacy and security, mutual consensus, transparency, accountability, tracking and tracing, and temperatureâhumidity control parameters.",

However, configuring BaaS appropriately for optimal performance and reliability resorts to try-and-error. A key challenge is that BaaS is often perceived as a âblack-box,â leading to uncertainties in performance and resource provisioning. Previous studies attempted to address this challenge; however, the impacts of both vertical and horizontal scaling remain elusive. To this end, we present machine learning-based models to predict network reliability and throughput based on scaling configurations. In our evaluation, the models exhibit prediction errors of\n1.9%, which is highly accurate and can be applied in the real-world.",

    "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of massive devices in different management domains, and the lack of trust among cross-domain entities leads to risks of data security and privacy leakage during information exchange. To address the above challenges, a viable solution that combines Certificateless Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC) with blockchain technology can be utilized. However, as many existing schemes rely on a single Key Generation Center (KGC), they are prone to problems such as single points of failure and high computational overhead. In this case, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based certificateless cross-domain authentication scheme, that integrates the threshold secret sharing mechanism without a trusted center, meanwhile, adopts blockchain technology to enable cross-domain entities to authenticate with each other and to negotiate session keys securely. This scheme also supports the dynamic joining and removing of multiple KGCs, ensuring secure and efficient cross-domain authentication and key negotiation. Comparative analysis with other protocols demonstrates that the proposed cross-domain authentication protocol can achieve high security with relatively low computational overhead. Moreover, this paper evaluates the scheme based on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain environment and simulates the performance of the certificateless scheme under different threshold parameters, and the simulation results show that the scheme has high performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain, like any other complex technology, needs a strong testing methodology to support its evolution in both research and development contexts. Setting up meaningful tests for permissionless blockchain technology is a notoriously complex task for several reasons: software is complex, a large number of nodes are involved, the network is non-ideal, etc. Developers usually adopt small virtual laboratories or costly real devnets based on real software. Researchers usually prefer simulations of a large number of nodes based on simplified models.\nIn this paper, we aim to obtain the advantages of both approaches, i.e., performing large, realistic, inexpensive, and flexible experiments, using real blockchain software within a virtual environment. To do that, we address the challenge of running large blockchain networks in a single physical machine, leveraging Linux and Docker. We analyze a number of problems that arise when large blockchain networks are emulated, and we provide technical solutions for all of them. Finally, we describe two experiences of emulating fairly large blockchain networks on a single machine: adopting both research-oriented and production-oriented software and involving more than 3000 containers.",

Moreover, the design of smart contracts can ensure the implementation of transactions and improve their reliability. In this study, the participants in an OIC and three types of infringement problems were analyzed. The Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm was applied to design the logic of smart contracts and the coupling between idea platforms and the blockchain.

Their adoption, however, is hindered by the constantly increasing size of blockchains and the sequential scan nature of their read operations, which introduce a clear inefficiency bottleneck. Also, the growing amount of data recorded on the blockchain makes resource-constrained light nodes dependent on untrusted full nodes for fetching information, with a consequent need for query authentication protocols ensuring result integrity. Motivated by these reasons, in this paper we propose the skip index, an indexing data structure that allows users to quickly retrieve information simultaneously from multiple blocks of a blockchain. Our solution is also designed to be used as an authenticated data structure to guarantee the integrity of query results for light nodes. We discuss the theoretical properties of skip indices, propose efficient algorithms for their construction and querying, and detail their computational complexity. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of our proposal through an experimental evaluation on the Ethereum blockchain. As a reference use case, we focus on the popular CryptoKitties application and simulate a scenario where users seek to retrieve the events generated by the service. Our experimental results suggest that the use of skip indices offers a constant multiplicative speedup, thanks to search times that are at most logarithmic within a chosen search window. This allows to reduce the number of visited blocks by up to two orders of magnitude if compared to the naive sequential approach currently in use.",

Nevertheless, blockchain technology in agricultural applications is still in the early stages of development. Therefore, this study aims to ascertain the efficiency and cognitive framework of blockchain technology for attaining long-term food security. This study used a review-based approach to ascertain the intellectual framework. A literature search was conducted using the \"Scopus\" database to locate research articles published between 2017 and 2023. A âsystematic literature reviewâ was performed using the PRISMA framework on the 52 eligible publications. The study results indicated that traceability, real-time information availability, and immutably distributed databases were the most influential factors. The results showed that blockchain technology has benefits beyond facilitating reliable data dissemination and establishing intimate bonds between manufacturers and clients. Furthermore, blockchain technology may pave the way for less food waste, improved supply chains and agricultural working environments, and more environmentally responsible eating practices. This study is the first of its kind to assess the intellectual structure of food security and augment the cognition of the in-depth examination of the benefits of blockchain technology that might ultimately provide a way to achieve zero-hunger goals.",

It highlights the potential integration of blockchain across sharing economy sectors (e.g., accommodation, transportation, and business services). Following the PRISMA protocol, 43 publications from 12 scholarly databases were analysed. It identifies different types of implementations, including decentralised apps and specific functionalities that utilise blockchain. Key issues are discussed, including contradictory aspects (transparency vs privacy, centralisation within decentralisation, and users' euphoria vs technical barriers) and advantages (increased security, automated sharing mechanisms, and user participation). The review offers practical implementation paths for blockchain-based sharing economy systems in hospitality and tourism, emphasising the importance of context, scope limitation, focusing on increasing advantages, and managing technological trade-offs. It also suggests critical future research topics and action agendas for hospitality and tourism stakeholders.",

The blockchain technology promises to disrupt the business models. However, the scholarly literature in blockchain research is only beginning to emerge, and the majority are focused on the technical aspect leaving aside the business model complexities for blockchain applications. This paper fills this gap and proposes a blockchain business model framework. The research utilizes a sequential exploratory research design (SERD), encompassing two key phases: an initial phase involving a literature review and interviews to delineate blockchain business model building blocks and types, followed by a subsequent survey to identify the most pertinent building blocks and types. The findings helped to formulate the framework, necessary building blocks, and block types specifically for the blockchain applications. Organizations can tailor their business model through various configuration options and mechanisms, considering the arrangement of block types within each block according to their significant score levels. By giving priority to those with scores above the block's average, organizations can evaluate the performance of their models and pinpoint areas for enhancement. The proposed framework can be considered as a reference point for developing business models for blockchain applications.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (172KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

To meet these needs, we followed the Grounded Theory research approach. We validate our architectural schema against a case study on managing a wine supply chain involving different companies and supervision authorities.\nResults: The proposed solution integrates blockchain-based applications with the existing information system as a module of the ecosystem, leveraging on the low costs, scalability, and high-level security because of the restricted access to the network.\nConclusion: We must go a long way in deepening and refining the possibilities offered by technology in supporting innovative multi-organizational business models. BBIEs can contribute substantially to paving the way in such a direction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRemote driving, an emergent technology enabling remote operations of vehicles, presents a significant challenge in transmitting large volumes of image data to a central server. This requirement outpaces the capacity of traditional communication methods. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework using semantic communications, through a region of interest semantic segmentation method, to reduce the communication costs by transmitting meaningful semantic information rather than bit-wise data. To solve the knowledge base inconsistencies inherent in semantic communications, we introduce a blockchain-based edge-assisted system for managing diverse and geographically varied semantic segmentation knowledge bases. This system not only ensures the security of data through the tamper-resistant nature of blockchain but also leverages edge computing for efficient management. Additionally, the implementation of blockchain sharding handles differentiated knowledge bases for various tasks, thus boosting overall blockchain efficiency. Experimental results show a great reduction in latency by sharding and an increase in model accuracy, confirming our framework's effectiveness.",

With the emergence of blockchain technology, research on blockchain-based data trading systems is receiving a lot of attention. Particularly, to reduce the on-chain storage cost, a novel paradigm of blockchain and cloud fusion has been widely considered as a promising data trading platform. Moreover, the fact that data can be used for commercial purposes will encourage users and organizations from various fields to participate in the data marketplace. In the data marketplace, it is a challenge how to trade the data securely outsourced to the external cloud in a way that restricts access to the data only to authorized users across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain bilateral access control protocol for blockchain-cloud based data trading systems. We consider a system model that consists of domain authorities, data senders, data receivers, a blockchain layer, and a cloud provider. The proposed protocol enables access control and source identification of the outsourced data by leveraging identity-based cryptographic techniques. In the proposed protocol, the outsourced data of the sender is encrypted under the target receiverâs identity, and the cloud provider performs policy-match verification on the authorization tags of the sender and receiver generated by the identity-based signature scheme. Therefore, data trading can be achieved only if the identities of the data sender and receiver simultaneously meet the policies specified by each other. To demonstrate efficiency, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol and compare it with existing studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLocation-Based Services (LBS) have greatly improved efficiency and functionality in various domains, but privacy and security concerns remain due to the centralized nature of many existing systems. To address these issues, this paper introduces the V-Track system, a decentralized architecture using blockchain technology for reliable vehicle location verification. By integrating GPS devices (SparkFun GPS NEO-M9), IoT-enabled sensors, and a Cosmos blockchain-based ledger (network of interconnected blockchains), V-Track aims to solve centralized LBS problems. Through rigorous simulation experiments, this paper evaluates the performance and security of the V-Track system and demonstrates its potential to provide reliable location verification while preserving user privacy. This paper makes significant contributions by presenting V-Track as a decentralized solution to centralized LBS privacy and security problems, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness through blockchain integration, improving tracking mechanisms with GPS devices and IoT sensors for improved accuracy, and providing a privacy-preserving alternative to centralized LBS through its decentralized design and use of blockchain technology. These advancements hold promise for applications across multiple sectors, including logistics, supply chain management, urban planning, and emerging fields such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality.",

Building on desk research and primary data from semi-structured surveys conducted with C-level executives and managers, this empirical analysis identifies major projects, their state of development, and prospects for digital transformation based on blockchain in the music industry. The findings reveal that there are a limited number of blockchain projects led by and/or with the relevant participation of CMOs. However, most are just research projects, proofs of concept, or pilots, showing that blockchain is currently in an experimental phase of development on the periphery of the music industry's digital transformation. This is not very different from analysts' understanding of the current situation and perspectives on the mass adoption of blockchain in other industries. In summary, blockchain is neither at the core of the music industry's digital transformation nor a priority for CMOs leading this process from the perspective of intellectual property rights management. The limited quality of music metadata, sparsity of sound data sources, and absence of a common data governance framework among different stakeholders within the industry are the main impediments to transforming blockchain into a global solution with transformative potential. Overall, the results provide a snapshot of the current status and possible future trajectories of blockchain adoption as a paradigm for intellectual property rights exchange within the music industry.",

However, the deployment and management of large-scale DAC faces challenges such as collections and analysis of energy consumption data, intricate device and system management, emission prediction and operation strategy, precise carbon footprint tracking, etc. This paper proposes the integration of blockchain technology with DAC systems to address these challenges, utilizing blockchain's inherent properties of immutability, security, and transparency. The implementation strategy includes the development of a DAC consortium blockchain system, leveraging a consensus mechanism,1 ECDSA encryption,2 IoT3 integration, and digital signatures. Preliminary modeling of the proposed system suggests potential improvements in operational efficiency and a reduction in data inaccuracies. The proposed system underscores the system's ability to streamline identity verification, improve data collection accuracy, and facilitate secure, confidential information sharing among DAC stakeholders. By enhancing the efficiency and reliability of DAC operations, this approach supports the scalable and effective deployment of NETs in the global effort to combat climate change. Future research will focus on empirical validation through pilot projects and simulations to further substantiate these claims.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most popular and effective systems in various industrial applications such as surveillance, security, and infrastructure inspection. It is gradually becoming an essential part of navigation as a consequence of high progress in military and civilian missions. Path planning of UAVs in military and civilian missions or in unknown and restricted environments is one of the biggest problems facing the operation of UAVs. This problem is not only searching for a path from an initial point to the final but also linked to find an optimal among all possible paths and provides collision avoidance. By examining the best path for UAVs, there is a need for the consideration of various other issues such as security and privacy, turning angle, overtake speed of obstacle, etc. The fundamental problem of UAVs is finding an optimal and secure route in a challenging environment. To overcome these challenges, many researchers have used optimization techniques such as ant colony, particle swarm, artificial bee colony, etc. with planning and coordination. In this paper, a blockchain-based solution is used to secure and authenticate UAVs. Hence, we propose a blockchain-based method that uses a genetic algorithm, which solves both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. The purpose of this technique is to locate the best possible flight path for the UAVs in a three-dimensional setting. In a genetic algorithm, each iteration is designed to surpass the previous one in terms of improvement. To achieve an ideal route, solving the travelling salesman problem is a crucial step in the proposed approach. Consequently, the blockchain technology offers a reliable wireless communication and a dependable network for UAVs path planning, guaranteeing efficient service. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of the proposed scheme. They show that a genetic algorithm is suitable for optimal path planning for UAVs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCloud services benefit countless users worldwide due to notable features, such as on-demand self-service, scalability, easy maintenance, etc. Secure storage and access to data in the cloud is critical. Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, which acts in a centralized way to provide access requests to the authenticated users. Controlled access sometimes fails to preserve the privacy of the sensitive information stored in the cloud due to several reasons, such as insider attacks, breaches of data security, or any other types of unauthorized access. This paper suggests a blockchain-assisted secure storage and access mechanism to secure sensitive data. Here blockchain is used as a trust management entity that verifies the identity of the user. Along with this it issues the Access Control Lists (ACLs) and identity token, and at the same time, it records all the interactions between the users and service providers. Data transmission is transparent since transactions are recorded. Importance is given to user privacy and decryption keys security. Linear(t,n) secret sharing scheme is used for key share generation and distribution. For experimentation, in MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet Goerli test network is used. Results reveal that our model consumes less cost to execute than other existing works. The total execution cost to upload and download a data file is 0.00281392 and 0.02455307 GoerliETH. Where the all verification operations such as identity token, ACL, access_log, and data integrity are executed in Zero gas value. The proposed model maintains a constant gas cost regardless of transaction volume, with costs of 33.04 ETH and 32.24 ETH for data upload and download. Moreover, we present a comparison of execution time performance in three different system configurations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study aims to assess the extent to which blockchain technology (BCT) may constitute an alternative to the conventional stock trading system and emphasize the changing roles of the key parties. It is expected that BCT would enhance the performance of the process across the three stages (i.e. trading, clearing and settlement within the stock exchange environment). A thorough literature review is conducted to understand the BCT performance modeling techniques and approaches (empirical and analytical) and to examine the theoretical potentials and capabilities of BCT in the financial markets. The case study and simulation methods are used to evaluate the impact of BCT implementation in optimizing the process of trading, clearing and settlement in Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) stock-trading activities. This paper presents a simulation analysis comparing a blockchain system with a traditional trading system in the context of stock market. The simulation procedures involve modeling processes over different durations and transaction volumes, using metrics such as process time and cycle time to evaluate performance. The performance index combines these metrics with weights to ensure accurate and consistent measurements. Simulation results reveal that the blockchain system significantly outperforms the current trading system, especially at higher transaction volumes, highlighting its scalability and efficiency. A threshold of 30,000 transactions is identified as the point where blockchainâs benefits become apparent. The analysis shows that blockchain significantly elevate the process efficiency. It reduces both cycle time and process time across varying transaction volumes, maintaining consistency and reliability. Additionally, a simple simulation using the Hyperledger Fabric platform demonstrates the practical implementation of a permissioned blockchain for clearing transactions, emphasizing the system's capability to manage high transaction volumes efficiently and securely. The use of blockchain network for handling seamless transactions using pre-defined smart contracts significantly improves the performance of the stock trading processes, specifically in the clearing phase. Interestingly, the BCT system drops the need for a âthird partyâ (i.e. stock custodian) across the three stages. At the end of the paper, we propose a thereat mitigating model for stock trading with a new blockchain system.",

Meanwhile, arbitrage bots are widely deployed and increasing in intelligent blockchain. These bots exploit the characteristics of cryptocurrencies exchanges to engage in frontrunning, generating substantial profits at the expense of ordinary users. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a more efficient asynchronous Byzantine ordered consensus protocol, which can be used to prevent arbitrage bots from changing the order of the transactions for profits in intelligent blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Specifically, we present two signal asynchronous common subset protocols, the more optimal one with only constant time complexity. We implement both our protocol and the optimal existing solution Chronos with Go language in the same environment. The experiment results indicate that our protocols achieve a threefold improvement over Chronos in consensus latency and nearly a tenfold increase in throughput.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe digital image capability of storing large amount of data has resulted in itâs increased popularity. Images are used to transmit large amount of information across different geographical locations using different cloud services. Securing these digitally stored images has remained a challenging task for researchers as they are prone to cyber- attacks. A potential solution to this problem can be blockchain, which provide secure and unchangeable storage. However, securing images on blockchain has another challenge as the image size increases the associated cost involved in blockchain. Fractional Discrete Cosine Transform(fctDCT) has the capability to minimizes the amount of data necessary for expressing an image in a secure way. This paper presents a novel framework for securely storing and retrieving medical images by extracting feature maps from medical images by fctDCT, followed by encoding and storing the feature map on decentralized cloud and linking them on blockchain. The integration has been implemented by using four different Î± angles which are stored on blockchain and are needed to be same at storage and retrieval stage as only the authentic user would have access to unique Î± angles and number of coefficients that have been used in storing their medical images. The performance of proposed framework has been evaluated by employing image quality metric such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and multi-SSIM by comparing it with correct and incorrect Î± values on four different values of Î±.",

Grounded in the Antecedents-Privacy Concerns-Outcomes (APCO) framework, we develop a theoretical model that we test in three experimental studies with a total of 1613 participants, utilizing verbal scenarios featuring blockchain applications for international money transfer and hotel booking. Our research reveals that complete disintermediation via pure peer-to-peer blockchain transactions is unlikely. Consumers prefer blockchain applications offering supplementary services like call centers, password assistance, and cancellation options. As consumers become familiar with blockchain technology, privacy concerns intensify due to its distributed and immutable storage. The fears of data breaches are more pronounced when blockchain applications are offered by unknown startups as opposed to well-known Big Tech companies. However, privacy-conscious consumers also value the prospect of distancing themselves from big-data ecosystems by embracing blockchain solutions from startups. Our research extends the APCO framework by clarifying how privacy concerns, brand-based heuristics, and technological attributes interact. For managerial implications, blockchain applications necessitate re-intermediation to meet consumer preferences. Potential intermediaries, including Big Tech firms, startups, and industry incumbents, face unique challenges in developing and marketing blockchain-enabled consumer services.",

As a response, the U.S. government ordered to apply open government in all government agencies. The open government's objective is to have open government systems that include open access to their records, procedures, and data for public review and engagement. Currently, government agencies control and filter shared data with the public, limiting the ability to efficiently and effectively promote public oversight. This paper proposes a conceptual model, named GovBlockchain, that has the potential to achieve open government data objectives. The GovBlockchain is illustrated using the procurement cycle, and the results are subsequently compared with current open government practice. The results indicate that GovBlockchain provides stakeholders with a higher level of transparency.",

However, the blockchain technology associated with accounting is in the experimental stage and has several problems to be solved including limited data processing capacity, information confidentiality, and regulatory difficulties. This innovation and progress in science and technology has provided more abundant, efficient, and professional technical support for the research of blockchain accounting documents. Among these advances, CiteSpace software has promoted the development of blockchain and accounting in the direction of visualization, comprehensiveness, security, and relevance. In this study, we used the knowledge map drawn by CiteSpace to search the core Blockchain Accounting database from 2013 to 2023 on the Web of Science (WoS). We obtained 1414 documents measured according to co-citation analysis, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) network clustering, co-occurrence keywords, and emergent time zone diagram method. We analyzed and summarized the important documents, research keywords, key research fields, and knowledge evolution related to \"blockchain accounting\" by network, literature integration, and popular research topics. We found that adopting blockchain technology in accounting information systems is expected to improve recordkeeping and reporting. Blockchain, as an innovative technology, provides a tamper-proof, traceable, and shareable platform for accounting information by using a distributed ledger system. By implementing blockchain, artificial intelligence can improve safety, transparency, and accuracy, and also may completely change the way we manage financial records. With its ability to improve overall efficiency and reduce errors, blockchain technology may change our familiar accounting methods. In addition, blockchain technology, intelligent contract, artificial intelligence, the Internet, information systems, and supply chain are the most important keywords, while blockchain technology, intelligent contract, and artificial intelligence are important components of blockchain accounting knowledge system. This research provided an important opportunity to advance the understanding of the crucial contribution of blockchain to the accounting field.",

This paper proposes an EV network hub (EVNH) comprising EVs, EV aggregators (EVAs), and charging nodes in the networked EV energy market pool. The various EVAs implement different heterogeneous blockchains. The EVNH facilitates blockchain-based secure and resilient energy trading under grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid systems. The paper emphasizes interoperability challenges involving different blockchains to communicate and transfer assets or data between them. We suggest secure and trustworthy energy trading across various EVAs using multiple EV tokens for EV energy trading through cross-chain communications. The EVAs consider a Nash equilibrium-seeking strategy to find the Nash equilibrium in the noncooperative game of EVAs. The effectiveness of the proposed EVNH is tested using MATLAB, Solidity, and Python software.",

It addresses the challenges of discrepancies between committed and delivered energy volumes, ensuring accurate billing, privacy, and accountability. PA-Bill employs a universal cost-splitting mechanism to enhance fairness and prevent indirect privacy leakage. The protocol leverages homomorphic encryption to protect user data and uses blockchain technology to maintain accountability through an immutable and transparent distributed ledger. Additionally, it includes a dispute resolution mechanism to rectify erroneous bill calculations and identify responsible parties, thus ensuring non-repudiation. Our experimental and theoretical evaluations demonstrates that PA-Bill effectively supports large communities of up to 2000 households, offering a computationally efficient, privacy-preserving, and accountable billing solution in a semi-decentralised manner.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the contemporary era, there is a heightened awareness of the significance of a spiritual life, and travel is a popular choice for many. The Internet is driving rapid diversification in people's travel choices. At the same time, the traditional tourism industry's Tourism Management (TM) model, which has been in place for decades, is no longer able to satisfy people's diversified choices for tourism. This is due to a number of factors, including the trust crisis caused by asymmetric information, the outdated nature of the TM model, and the insecure personal information that is shared between intermediaries. This paper discusses the application of sustainable blockchain technology in tourism management and sets up a tourism management system based on blockchain and the Internet of Things. It takes 20 scenic spots as examples to study the application of the TM model. This paper evaluates the TM model from four key aspects: tourist satisfaction, tourism infrastructure completeness, tourism consumption level and tourism service content richness. It compares the results with those of the traditional TM system. The experimental results are clear: tourist satisfaction at scenic spots 5, 10 and 15 in the sustainable blockchain TM mode is 68 %, 87 % and 71 % respectively, which is higher than that in the traditional TM mode. In the context of sustainable blockchain, the TM mode is the optimal approach for serving tourists and enhancing their travel experience. This study also assists Chinese tourism business operators in recognizing the potential impact of blockchain technology on the development of the tourism industry. They can then formulate strategies at an early stage to cope with the information technology changes in the era of the digital economy.",

By conducting a content analysis of thirty-two expert reports from the blockchain-based metaverse industry, the study identifies five key attributes that can potentially cultivate innovation and decentralized sustainable management within the business domain. These attributes include a creator economy, a persistent synchronous virtual environment, decentralization, an interoperable network, and a digitalized mindset. The research underscores the need for stakeholders to adopt a sustainable approach when navigating the blockchain-based metaverse, highlighting the potential benefits achievable in a decentralized, hybrid physical-digital environment. This work stands as a pioneering effort in conceptualizing a theoretical framework that encapsulates decentralized sustainable management within the blockchain-based metaverse, underpinned by the principles of stakeholder capitalism. Thus, it contributes significantly to the academic discourse on the sustainable implications of blockchain technology in new business models.",

Despite the energy production obstacles, the steady availability of fossil fuels continues to compete due to established distribution systems, as societies increasingly rely on electricity. Hydrogen fuel has emerged as a promising avenue for energy production, storage, and distribution, involving converting surplus renewable electricity into hydrogen through electrolysis, storing it, and distributing it. Our novel approach leverages blockchain technology to enhance the efficiency and traceability of hydrogen fuel production, offering a unique synergy of transparency, security, and decentralized governance. We showcase its viability and effectiveness using the ERC-1155 token standard to tokenize renewable resources and convert them into hydrogen fuel. Within our tokenized fuel blockchain architecture, we simulate the forecasted growth in hydrogen production and vehicle demand, highlighting our approach's efficiency, traceability, and transparency. This integration showcases the potential for a sustainable hydrogen fuel ecosystem. The gas consumption data analysis indicates that the daily gas consumption remains below 194 million Gas for refilling 3245 vehicles (including the cost of one-time contract deployment), demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (58KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the education sector, blockchain is currently at the end of the peak of inflated expectations in Gartnerâs Hype Cycle. Thus, it is crucial to understand whether this technology meets the expectations of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). We go on an expedition to identify blockchain application scenarios and its potential for HEI administrationâthe universities are digitalized to just 23.3%.\nCurrent information systems research addresses classifications of blockchain-based projects (application level) rather than their technical realization (protocol level). Thus, when evaluating blockchain application scenarios in HEI administration, we intensively consider the technical side of blockchain-based projects. We perform a three-step approach: (1) systematic literature review, (2) qualitative exploratory semi-structured interviews to supplement information on market-ready solutions, and (3) an evaluation of the potential of the blockchain-based projects identified, based on HEI administration requirements.\nWe find that the leading blockchain application scenarios are credential verification and record-sharing. At the protocol level, we obtain equivocal results regarding the technical realization of projects, e.g., their underlying blockchain types and storage models. At the application level, when discussing the potential of different projects, we find that most of them address adaptability, complexity decomposition, and cost reduction requirements between HEIs; interest diversity and stakeholder collaboration between HEIs and business actors; privacy and trust between HEIs and students.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (387KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the growing utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), low-altitude airspace is becoming increasingly congested, posing significant challenges to Air Traffic Control (ATC). The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is used to report the location of UAVs. However, due to channel noise and adversarial interference, ADS-B data may be inaccurate. To address this issue, a position estimation method based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Multi-Layer Perceptron (BiLSTM-MLP) was proposed. In this method, ADS-B signal power is used to estimate the position of UAVs as a baseline approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the BiLSTM-MLP based method significantly improves estimation accuracy. Moreover, a blockchain-based dynamic reputation mechanism, aligned with the position estimation method, was proposed. The mechanism integrates information from the third-party UAV and the location data provided by the UAV itself to dynamically update the credibility of the UAV, and thus achieves decentralized access control of UAVs in low-altitude airspace.",

Executing processes related to healthcare domain in a trusted, secure, efficient, accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and negatively impact health outcomes. To cope with such issues, blockchain technology, combined with the Internet of Things (IoT), can offers a reliable way to track and trace products and protect medical data though a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger. Hence, this paper proposes an IoT-driven blockchain-based architecture to manage the healthcare supply chain and protect medical records from tampering and access violation. Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain, has been adopted due to the sensitive and private nature of the collected data. The envisioned network has been implemented and performance has been evaluated in terms of execution time, resources consumption and throughput.",

This shift is redefining traditional roles and is propelled by a growing demand for sustainable and renewable energy. Prosumers utilize decentralized energy sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, enhancing energy independence by producing their own energy and selling any surplus back to the grid. However, this decentralized landscape presents challenges in accurately tracking carbon emissions and establishing equitable pricing mechanisms. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform for carbon allowances. This novel approach gives prosumers a decisive influence over energy pricing, ensuring a more equitable distribution of energy resources. The blockchain framework benefits from decentralization, promoting transparency, security, and an immutable record of energy transactions and carbon emissions. To evaluate the platformâs effectiveness, we will initiate a real-world pilot project within the Education City Community Housing (ECCH) to gather empirical data over one year. The pilot will involve various participantsâincluding prosumers and traditional consumersâand will meticulously monitor energy production, consumption, and trading activities. By comparing this decentralized system with traditional energy models, we aim to assess its impact on carbon emissions, user satisfaction, and overall economic viability, paving the way for a sustainable energy future.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (184KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Despite this enthusiasm, empirical research examining the practical feasibility and critical assessment of blockchain's potential within the circular economy remains limited. This study engages with eleven distinguished blockchain experts to critically analyze the prospects of technology integration across various facets of the circular economy, aiming to predict potential outcomes. Utilizing the Delphi method, this research seeks to attain a consensus on the experts' visions and opinions. The findings suggest a nuanced perspective: while certain integrations in the circular economy may face challenges and are unlikely to succeed, others could prove effective in the long term, provided specific conditions are met. When appropriately designed Tokenomics are in place, and the necessary level of digitalization is achieved, blockchain technology can significantly incentivize circular economy practices. However, the complete disintermediation of circular practices through blockchain is viewed as less feasible, owing to its reliance on external data providers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rising prominence of blockchain technology has spurred researchers to delve deeper into its applications through the lens of organizational and management theories. Our thematic analysis of blockchain literature reveals examination across five key areas: economic, strategic, operational, behavioral, and implementation considerations, each viewed through various theoretical perspectives. The multifaceted nature of blockchain phenomena necessitates diverse types of theory and research questions. Thus, the unique characteristics within each area stimulate the formulation of inquiries that address a system of research questions about what, how, why, when, where, what will be, and how to do. Existing literature predominantly emphasizes explanatory and predictive type of theories, notably expanding research topics such as blockchain adoption behavior. However, this singular focus limits the exploration of diverse reasoning approaches suited to blockchain's complexity. Our study illustrates how different types of theory contribute to understanding each of the identified blockchain application areas. Based on our findings, we propose pertinent questions that highlight the need for varied theoretical frameworks and address specific issues within each application area. Furthermore, we recommend appropriate type of theories to address these questions, fostering a more multi-perspective investigation across the breadth of blockchain-related research topics and areas. By embracing diverse theoretical perspectives, we aim to create a more balanced research landscape, facilitating deeper insights into blockchain phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network system that connects physical devices through the Internet, allowing them to interact. Nowadays, IoT has become an integral part of our lives, offering convenience and smart functionality. However, the growing number of IoT devices has brought about a corresponding increase in cybersecurity threats, such as device vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and network susceptibilities. Integrating blockchain technology with IoT has proven to be a promising approach to enhance IoT security. Nevertheless, the emergence of quantum computing poses a significant challenge to the security of traditional classical cryptography used in blockchain, potentially exposing it to quantum cyber-attacks. To support the growth of the IoT industry, mitigate quantum threats, and safeguard IoT data, this study proposes a robust blockchain solution for IoT that incorporates both classical and post-quantum security measures. Firstly, we present the Quantum-Enhanced Blockchain Architecture for IoT (QBIoT) to ensure secure data sharing and integrity protection. Secondly, we propose an improved Proof of Authority consensus algorithm called âProof of Authority with Random Electionâ (PoARE), implemented within QBIoT for leader selection and new block creation. Thirdly, we develop a public-key quantum signature protocol for transaction verification in the blockchain. Finally, a comprehensive security analysis of QBIoT demonstrates its resilience against cyber threats from both classical and quantum adversaries. In summary, this research introduces an innovative quantum-enhanced blockchain solution to address quantum security concerns within the realm of IoT. The proposed QBIoT framework contributes to the ongoing development of quantum blockchain technology and offers valuable insights for future research on IoT security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has promising benefits and provides robust solutions for managing business processes. While prior studies have primarily explored its potential in supporting logistics and supply chain management, many practitioners still lack a clear understanding of how to leverage blockchain technology, hindering its adoption within the industry. Bridging this gap and addressing critical barriers requires further empirical research. This study adopts a comprehensive approach, identifying potential barriers through a literature review and validating their significance through the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC). The study then delves into the interrelationships among the significant barriers, utilising Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and MICMAC methods. The results highlight seven significant barriers within the logistics sector, encompassing a lack of government support, operational standards, top management support, limited public awareness, trust issues, technical challenges, and network collaboration difficulties. Notably, the lack of public awareness and inadequate governmental support form fundamental obstacles that drive various challenges. This research offers insights into the barriers that hinder the successful adoption of blockchain technology in logistics, proposing several mitigation strategies that are in line with the principles of open innovation.",

    "abstract": "Users and edge servers are not fully mutually trusted in mobile edge computing (MEC), and hence blockchain can be introduced to provide trustable MEC. In blockchain-based MEC, each edge server functions as a node in both MEC and blockchain, processing usersâ tasks and then uploading the task related information to the blockchain. That is, each edge server runs both usersâ offloaded tasks and blockchain tasks simultaneously. Note that there is a trade-off between the resource allocation for MEC and blockchain tasks. Therefore, the allocation of the resources of edge servers to the blockchain and the MEC is crucial for the processing delay of blockchain-based MEC. Most of the existing research tackles the problem of resource allocation in either blockchain or MEC, which leads to unfavorable performance of the blockchain-based MEC system. In this paper, we study how to allocate the computing resources of edge servers to the MEC and blockchain tasks with the aim to minimize the total system processing delay. For the problem, we propose a computing resource Allocation algorithm for Blockchain-based MEC (ABM) which utilizes the Slaterâs condition, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function and subgradient projection method to obtain the solution. Simulation results show that ABM converges and effectively reduces the processing delay of blockchain-based MEC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCognitive radio network (CRN) uses the available spectrum resources wisely. Spectrum sensing is the central element of a CRN. However, spectrum sensing is susceptible to multiple security breaches caused by malicious users (MUs). These attackers attempt to change the sensed result in order to decrease network performance. In our proposed approach, with the help of blockchain-based technology, the fusion center is able to detect and prevent such criminal activities. The method of our model makes use of blockchain-based MU detection with SHA-3 hashing and energy detection-based spectrum sensing. The detection strategy takes place in two stages: block updation phase and iron out phase. The simulation results of the proposed method demonstrate 3.125%, 6.5%, and 8.8% more detection probability at â5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of MUs, when compared to other methods like equal gain combining (EGC), blockchain-based cooperative spectrum sensing (BCSS), and fault-tolerant cooperative spectrum sensing (FTCSS), respectively. Thus, the security of cognitive radio blockchain network is proved to be significantly improved.",

Firstly, we enhance the system into two layers and construct a Layer-2 distributed key management service framework. This framework improves system efficiency and scalability while reducing costs. Secondly, we design the proof of trust contribution (PoTC) consensus algorithm to elect high-trust nodes responsible for DKG and implement an incentive mechanism for key computation through smart contract design. Finally, we design a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol to achieve correctness verification of off-chain key computation. Security analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that our scheme achieves high security while significantly improving system performance. The time consumption for data users to obtain attribute private keys is controlled at tens of milliseconds.",

Traditional approaches, such as exposure therapies, have shown efficacy but are limited by their inability to provide immersive and controlled environments for effective therapy. These methods often struggle to replicate the intensity and authenticity of claustrophobic scenarios and face challenges in data security and patient engagement. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and Non-Fungible Token (NFT)-based metaverse to create a decentralized, transparent, immersive, and secure platform for claustrophobia exposure therapy. Our approach integrates blockchain technology for decentralized data management and NFTs for incentivizing patient participation, offering a unique enhancement to traditional therapy methods. We develop four blockchain smart contracts to manage registration, access control, NFT management, progress monitoring, and incentives distribution. Our system architecture, sequence diagrams, and algorithms are presented to demonstrate the functionality of our solution. We validate our approach through functionality testing, cost evaluation, and security analysis. Specifically, we measure the gas consumption of the smart contracts, analyze transaction costs, and assess system security against vulnerabilities. Additionally, we leverage existing literature to support the effectiveness of NFTs as incentives and the role of blockchain in enhancing data security and participation. The results show improvements in therapy engagement and data security, validating the practical implications of integrating blockchain and metaverse technologies in mental health therapy. We discuss the practical implications, challenges, and limitations of our solution, along with guidelines for generalization. The source code is publicly available on GitHub.",

Blockchain technology faces significant challenges in privacy protection while ensuring data immutability and transparency, so it is crucial to implement private computing in blockchain. To target the privacy issues in blockchain, we design a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocol DHSMPC based on homomorphic encryption in this paper. On the one hand, homomorphic encryption technology can directly operate on ciphertext, solving the privacy problem in the blockchain. On the other hand, this paper designs the directed decryption function of DHSMPC to resist malicious opponents in the CRS model, so that authorized users who do not participate in the calculation can also access the decryption results of secure multi-party computation. Analytical and experimental results show that DHSMPC has smaller ciphertext size and stronger performance than existing SMPC protocols. The protocol makes it possible to implement complex calculations in multi-party scenarios and is proven to be resistant to various semi-malicious attacks, ensuring data security and privacy. Finally, this article combines the designed DHSMPC protocol with blockchain and cloud computing, showing how to use this solution to achieve trusted data management in specific scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman intelligence tasks (HITs), such as labeling images for machine learning, are widely utilized for crowdsourcing human knowledge. Centralized crowdsourcing platforms face challenges of a single point of failure and a lack of service transparency. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing approaches overlook the low scalability problem of permissionless blockchains or inconveniently rely on existing ground-truth data as the root of trust in evaluating the quality of workers' answers. We propose a blockchain-based crowdsourcing scheme for ensuring dual fairness (i.e., preventing false reporting and free riding) and improving on-chain efficiency concerning on-chain storage and smart contract computation. The proposed scheme does not rely on trusted authorities but rather depends on a public blockchain to guarantee dual fairness. An efficient and publicly verifiable truth discovery scheme is designed based on majority voting and cryptographic accumulators. This truth discovery scheme aims at inferring ground truth from workers' answers. The ground truth is further utilized to estimate the quality of workers' answers. Additionally, a novel blockchain-based protocol is designed to further reduce on-chain costs while ensuring truthfulness. The scheme has O(n) complexity for both on-chain storage and smart contract computation, regardless of the number of questions, where n denotes the number of workers. Formal security analysis is provided, and extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its effectiveness and performance.",

Despite the advantages of decentralized storage, the proliferation of decentralized technologies has highlighted the need to address the issue of file ownership. The aim of this paper is to address the critical issues of source verification and digital copyright protection for IPFS image files. To this end, an innovative approach is proposed that integrates blockchain, digital signature, and blind watermarking. Blockchain technology functions as a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger, recording and verifying the source information of files, thereby establishing credible evidence of file origin. A digital signature serves to authenticate the identity and integrity of the individual responsible for uploading the file, ensuring data security. Furthermore, blind watermarking is employed to embed invisible information within images, thereby safeguarding digital copyrights and enabling file traceability. To further optimize the efficiency of file retrieval within IPFS, a dual-layer Distributed Hash Table (DHT) indexing structure is proposed. This structure divides file index information into a global index layer and a local index layer, significantly reducing retrieval time and network overhead. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through practical examples, providing an effective solution to the copyright protection issues associated with IPFS image files.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain full nodes are pivotal for transaction availability, as they store the entire ledger, but verifying their storage integrity faces challenges from malicious remote storage attacks such as Sybil, outsourcing, and generation attacks. However, there is no suitable proof-of-storage solution for blockchain full nodes to ensure a healthy number of replicas of the ledger. Existing proof-of-storage solutions are designed for general-purpose settings where a data owner uses secret information to verify storage, rendering them unsuitable for blockchain where proof-of-storage must be fast, publicly verifiable, and data owner-agnostic. This paper introduces a decentralised and quantum-resistant solution named Non-interactive Practical Proof of Storage (nPPoS) with an asymmetric encoding and decoding scheme for fast and secure PoStorage and Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) for public variability in blockchain full nodes. The algorithm with asymmetric times for encoding and decoding creates unique block replicas and corresponding proofs for each storage node to mitigate malicious remote attacks and minimise performance degradation. The intentional resource-intensive encoding deters attacks, while faster decoding minimises performance overhead. Through zk-STARKs, nPPoS achieves public verifiability, enabling one-to-many verification for scalability, quantum resistance and decentralisation. It also introduces a two-phase randomisation technique and a time-weighted trustworthiness measurement for scalability and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Prism blockchain. The recent advancements in the field of IoT motivate the development of a secure infrastructure for storing and sharing vast amounts of data. Blockchain, a distributed and immutable ledger, is best known as a potential solution to data security and privacy for the IoT. The scalability of blockchain, which should optimize the throughput and handle the dynamics of the IoT environment, becomes a challenge due to the enormous amount of IoT data. The critical challenge in scaling blockchain is to guarantee decentralization, latency, and security of the system while optimizing the transaction throughput. This paper presents a DRL-based performance optimization for blockchain-enabled IoT. We consider one of the recent promising blockchains, Prism, as the underlying blockchain system because of its good performance guarantees. We integrate the IoT data into Prism blockchain and optimize the performance of the system by leveraging the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method. The DRL method helps to optimize the blockchain parameters like mining rate and mined blocks to adapt to the environment dynamics of the IoT system. Our results show that the proposed method can improve the throughput of Prism blockchain-based IoT systems while preserving Prism performance guarantees. Our scheme can achieve 1.5 times more system rewards than IoT-integrated Prism. In our experimental setup, the proposed scheme could improve the average throughput of the system by about 6,000 transactions per second compared to Prism.",

    "abstract": "Users and edge servers are not fully mutually trusted in mobile edge computing (MEC), and hence blockchain can be introduced to provide trustable MEC. In blockchain-based MEC, each edge server functions as a node in both MEC and blockchain, processing usersâ tasks and then uploading the task related information to the blockchain. That is, each edge server runs both usersâ offloaded tasks and blockchain tasks simultaneously. Note that there is a trade-off between the resource allocation for MEC and blockchain tasks. Therefore, the allocation of the resources of edge servers to the blockchain and the MEC is crucial for the processing delay of blockchain-based MEC. Most of the existing research tackles the problem of resource allocation in either blockchain or MEC, which leads to unfavorable performance of the blockchain-based MEC system. In this paper, we study how to allocate the computing resources of edge servers to the MEC and blockchain tasks with the aim to minimize the total system processing delay. For the problem, we propose a computing resource Allocation algorithm for Blockchain-based MEC (ABM) which utilizes the Slaterâs condition, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function and subgradient projection method to obtain the solution. Simulation results show that ABM converges and effectively reduces the processing delay of blockchain-based MEC.",

In this paper a novel decentralized peer-to-peer energy trading system leveraging blockchain technology is proposed. The proposed model not only demonstrates the implementation of blockchain technology in microgrids but also transforms the energy sector by emphasizing decentralization, security and efficiency. This research aims to enhance the energy trading system by including smart contracts written on the Ethereum network. Energy Token and Demand Response contracts are integrated to enable dynamic interactions inside microgrids, which leads to a transparent, secure, and efficient energy trading system. Moreover, automation of energy transactions and elimination of intermediaries ensure cost effectiveness and utilization of excess energy potentially reduce dependency on the main grid. A microgrid system is designed in Simulink for distributed energy trading. Energy credits are represented by standard ERC-20 digital token and then demand response contract dynamically adjusts rewards and energy prices based on energy production and consumption. the ERC-20 contract manages the token transaction and then demand response contract enforces governance rules. The purpose of a demand response contract is to enable the automatic and efficient control of energy usage in response to changing demand and supply conditions. The use of the Web3 library further facilitates a direct and smooth connection between the blockchain network and microgrids. The results demonstrate the successful implementation of both smart contracts, making trading possible at noon when the combined generation from solar array and energy management system exceed the energy demand.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (71KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This system is composed of three layers: Data extraction and storage, data management, and data application. Focusing on healthcare and medical data, a healthcare and medical blockchain is constructed to realize data storage, transfer, processing, and access with security, real-time, reliability, and integrity. An improved master node selection consensus mechanism is presented to detect and prevent dishonest behavior, ensuring the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the collaborative model training process. Furthermore, healthcare and medical data collaboration services in real-world scenarios have been discussed and developed. To further validate the performance of FL-HMChain, a Convolutional Neural Network-based Federated Learning (FL-CNN-HMChain) model is investigated for medical image identification. This model achieves better performance compared to the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), having an average improvement of 4.7% on Area Under Curve (AUC) and 7% on Accuracy (ACC), respectively. Furthermore, the probability of privacy leakage can be effectively reduced by the blockchain-based parameter transfer mechanism in federated learning between local and global models.",

Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution, yet the implementation of blockchain applications entails significant costs. Assessing the feasibility of such implementations through simulation is imperative but has been hindered by a lack of details survey about the simulation tools leading to wrong choice of tools by the researchers, as every application is unique and requires specific blockchain platform as per use.\nThis paper covers an extensive survey of 32 simulation tools used in blockchain, focusing on their advantages, limitations, platform used, and capability to evaluate performance metrics of blockchain applications. This enables the researchers to choose the correct simulation tool for their work. The work allows the programmer to test their application using the correct simulation tool, saving implementation costs and time. Furthermore, we discussed CBlockSim, a simulation tool designed specifically for blockchain applications, elucidating its functionality through a comparative study of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nOur work contributes to advancing the understanding and application of simulation tools in blockchain-based sensor data security, offering insights that can significantly enhance the security posture of sensor networks.",

However, there is very little knowledge of the uptake of blockchain in accounting, and most blockchain accounting research is conceptual, lacking empirical evidence. This study addresses this gap and examines the organisational factors that drive and hinder the adoption of blockchain in accounting, as well as the perceived benefits. Using the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework, we analyse interview data collected from blockchain experts and accountants (N = 19). The findings confirm the influence of nine context-specific factors, highlighting the challenges and lack of knowledge in understanding the usage and benefits of blockchain in accounting, its complex integration with existing accounting systems, and the increased costs associated with the adoption intention. This study provides novel empirical evidence of the factors by adequately contextualising an established theoretical framework in the context of accounting. The findings are useful for practitioners and the broader accounting information systems research community as they provide empirical insights into how context-specific factors influence blockchain adoption in accounting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo address the challenges of low credibility, difficult data sharing, and regulatory supervision issues involving electronic evidence storage in the judicial preservation process, this paper proposes a blockchain-based judicial evidence preservation scheme. The scheme utilizes the characteristics of blockchainâs immutability to achieve credible forensics of electronic evidence on the chain and employs the decentralized storage of the interplanetary file system for secure and efficient off-chain storage. Simultaneously, it resolves the problem of declining throughput due to limited block capacity. Additionally, it leverages smart contract technology to encompass major aspects of the judicial process, including user case registration, authority management, judicial evidence uploading and downloading, case data sharing, partial disclosure of case information, and regulatory review. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the scheme significantly improves throughput and stability. Performance tests indicate that the transfer speed of the interplanetary file system can meet the data-sharing needs of judicial organizations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain full nodes are pivotal for transaction availability, as they store the entire ledger, but verifying their storage integrity faces challenges from malicious remote storage attacks such as Sybil, outsourcing, and generation attacks. However, there is no suitable proof-of-storage solution for blockchain full nodes to ensure a healthy number of replicas of the ledger. Existing proof-of-storage solutions are designed for general-purpose settings where a data owner uses secret information to verify storage, rendering them unsuitable for blockchain where proof-of-storage must be fast, publicly verifiable, and data owner-agnostic. This paper introduces a decentralised and quantum-resistant solution named Non-interactive Practical Proof of Storage (nPPoS) with an asymmetric encoding and decoding scheme for fast and secure PoStorage and Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) for public variability in blockchain full nodes. The algorithm with asymmetric times for encoding and decoding creates unique block replicas and corresponding proofs for each storage node to mitigate malicious remote attacks and minimise performance degradation. The intentional resource-intensive encoding deters attacks, while faster decoding minimises performance overhead. Through zk-STARKs, nPPoS achieves public verifiability, enabling one-to-many verification for scalability, quantum resistance and decentralisation. It also introduces a two-phase randomisation technique and a time-weighted trustworthiness measurement for scalability and adaptability.",

Today we are surrounded by various smart devices, such as smart phones, smart homes, smart cars, smart televisions, and smartwatches that assist us in making our lives easier and smoother. IoT is a conglomeration of multiple technologies at various layers to impart the best of ubiquitous and pervasive computing to deliver several benefits in a variety of application sectors such as medicine, agriculture, and industry. In an IoT setting, blockchain technology is used for addressing security challenges and eradicating third-party participation. Utilizing public networks for storing or transmitting health care images poses risks of eavesdropping, data breaches, and unauthorized access. Before uploading medical data to the decentralized network, encryption is required to prevent unauthorized access. The aim of this study is to integrate technologies to ensure transactions are conducted safely and securely. We proposed an IoT-Blockchain system based on chaos encryption scheme using Tinkerbell mapping to ensure medical data integrity and authenticity. The suggested approach is examined to assess performance parameters such as, key space analysis, key sensitivity analysis, Information Entropy (IE), histogram, correlation of adjacent pixels, Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These findings demonstrated that the suggested method is extremely efficient in avoiding security breaches and guaranteeing information integrity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe advancements in telematics and communication technology for automobiles have contributed to the development of Vehicular ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). These networks serve as the foundation for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Communication across various VANET entities is challenging due to the open communication environment and the highly dynamic nature of VANETs. One of the major challenges in VANETs is ensuring stable and secure transmission. To address these factors, several studies have been conducted. The article discusses a clustering algorithm for VANETs that leverages SCVAN-DPSO to create stable clusters and provide secure communication for mitigating malicious nodes. Additionally, Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) with signcryption in blockchain is proposed. This algorithm is designed to identify and mitigate malicious nodes, ensuring robust and secure communication within the network. To verify vehicles in VANETs, this study also suggests a safe and reliable key management method that generates and stores cryptographic keys using blockchainâs distributed ledger technology. By doing so, the risk of rogue nodes is reduced, and a safe, stable connection between vehicles is guaranteed. This work has been implemented using NS 3.34 simulation with the SUMO real-time traffic mobility simulator, and its performance has been evaluated. The proposed algorithm SCVAN-BKM provides a 99.6 % packet delivery ratio for 20 nodes, 0.4 % packet loss, end-to-end delay of 32.65 ms, throughput of 9.522 Mbps, and a cluster lifetime of 105 s. As the number of nodes increases in the communication zone, stable communication is maintained due to the clustering algorithm used in the proposed approach, as cluster formation supports stability in the high-mobility nature of vehicles, while secure communication is ensured using blockchain technology. The findings demonstrate that our approach is more effective and yields better outcomes than existing systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology, based on decentralized data storage and distributed consensus design, has became a promising solution to address data security risks and provide privacy protection in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to its tamper-proof and non-repudiation features. Although blockchain typically does not require the endorsement of third-party trust organizations, it mostly needs to perform necessary mathematical calculations to prevent malicious attacks, which results in stricter requirements for computation resources on the participating devices. By offloading the computation tasks required to support blockchain consensus to edge service nodes or the cloud, while providing data privacy protection for IoT applications, it can effectively address the limitations of computation and energy resources in IoT devices. However, how to make reasonable offloading decisions for IoT devices remains an open issue. Due to the excellent self-learning ability of Reinforcement Learning (RL), this paper proposes a RL enabled Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithm (RLSIOA) that aims to improve the quality of initial solutions and achieve efficient optimization of computation task offloading decisions. The algorithm considers various factors that may affect the revenue obtained by IoT devices executing consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof-of-Work), It optimizes the proportion of sub-tasks to be offloaded and the scale of computing resources to be rented from the edge and cloud to maximize the revenue of devices. Experimental results show that RLSIOA can obtain higher-quality offloading decision-making schemes at lower latency costs compared to representative benchmark algorithms.",

Nevertheless, certain blockchain-based protocols, particularly those reliant on permissioned blockchains, continue to be under the governance of a central authority (CA). This central authority possesses extensive control capabilities, including the facilitation of user network access, as well as the establishment, connection, and revocation of users to and from the network. Consequently, the majority of policies within these protocols are centrally administered by a singular party. This paper introduces an architectural framework and a specific protocol denoted as the âAnonymous Reporting System with No Central Authorityâ (ARSnCA) on a public blockchain infrastructure. This design aims to mitigate the challenges posed by untrusted privileged insiders to the ARSnCA. It is hypothesized that this approach can enhance system reliability, fault tolerance, and foster trust among network members. To eliminate the central authority, a concept termed the virtual blockchain (VBC) is implemented as an embedded permissioned blockchain within a permissionless blockchain. Following the removal of the CA, the authorities previously held by the central authority are transferred to the members of the VBC. Comparative analysis and evaluation of the ARSnCA protocol demonstrate a performance advantage, with speeds that are\nand\nfaster than reporting protocols based on ring signatures and other protocols included in the comparison.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCyberâphysical systems (CPSs) are being increasingly adopted for industrial applications, yet they involve a dynamic threat landscape that requires CPSs to adapt to emerging threats during their operation. Recently, digital twin (DT) technology (which refers to a virtual representation of a product, process, or environment) has emerged as a suitable candidate to address the security challenges faced by dynamic CPSs. DT has the capability of strengthening the security of CPSs by continuously mapping the physical to twin counterparts to detect inconsistencies. The existing DT-based security solutions are constrained by untrustworthy data dissemination as well as limited data sharing among the involved stakeholders, which, in turn, limit the ability of DTs to run accurate simulations or make valid decisions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a modular framework called TRusted and Intelligent cyber-PhysicaL systEm (TRIPLE), that leverages blockchain, DTs, and threat intelligence (TI) to secure CPSs. The blockchain-based DT components in the framework provide data integrity, traceability, and availability for trusted DTs. Furthermore, to accurately and comprehensively model system states, the framework envisions fusing process knowledge for modeling DTs from system specification-based and learning-based information and other sources, including infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and knowledge base (KB). The framework also integrates TI for future-proofing against emerging threats, such that threats can be detected either reactively by mapping the behavior of physical and virtual spaces or proactively by TI and threat hunting. We demonstrate the viability of the framework through a proof of concept. Finally, we formally verify the TRIPLE framework to demonstrate its correctness and effectiveness in enhancing CPS security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology can potentially be a bedrock for the energy record-keeping system. This study examined several critical factors that affect usersâ intention to accept Blockchain technology for the Smart grid. The proposed model is based on the Technology Organization Environment framework, which is examined using Structural Equation Modelling. Based on the study findings, it has been indicated that the relative advantage shows a significant effect and matters the most during the Blockchain technology adoption in the Smart grid. The innovativeness, cost saving, and regulatory support also significantly influence the intention to use the Blockchain technology. The innovativeness and traceability show a significant influence on upper management support. The traceability shows a substantial impact on cost savings. However, innovativeness shows an insignificant effect on cost savings. The traceability and competitive pressure do not affect the intention to use the Blockchain technology. This study has extended the Technology Organization Environment theory, which predicts the organizational behavior to adopt the Blockchain technology for the Smart grid. We argue that the finding provides insights to guide the industry to deliver the best practice on the Blockchain technology. The study findings suggest that experts would recognize innovative technology free of effort to raise the determined aids for improving the traditional energy system. Though there are some limits, theoretical and practical implications are justified based on the findings.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is extensively deployed in outdoor and open environments to effectively address traffic efficiency and safety issues by connecting vehicles to the network. However, due to the open and variable nature of its network topology, vehicles frequently engage in cross-domain interactions. During such processes, directly uploading sensitive information to roadside units for interaction may expose it to malicious tampering or interception by attackers, thus compromising the security of the cross-domain authentication process. Additionally, IoV imposes high real-time requirements, and existing cross-domain authentication schemes for IoV often encounter efficiency issues. To mitigate these challenges, we propose CAIoV, a blockchain-based efficient cross-domain authentication scheme for IoV. This scheme comprehensively integrates technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, smart contracts, and Merkle hash tree structures. It divides the cross-domain process into anonymous cross-domain authentication and safe cross-domain authentication phases to ensure efficiency while maintaining a balance between efficiency and security. Finally, we evaluate the performance of CAIoV. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces computational overhead by approximately 20%, communication overhead by around 10%, and storage overhead by nearly 30%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, user-generated content is pivotal for many companies: people trust other customers' opinions more than any brand advertisement. Brands are aware of this and try to promote and motivate their customers to create high-quality content. However, this way of operating is still at an early stage: there is a lack of fairness, as companies typically do not provide a validation system, or if they do, it is not based on a transparent solution, and often, there is no reward for creating unique and high-quality content. In this paper, we focus on the problem of incentivizing users' creation of content in the form of customer reviews in the online grocery industry. Specifically, we illustrate the solution to the problem devised in the Re-Taled project by relying on blockchain technology. We develop a decentralized ecosystem of consumers, influencers, and manufacturers, where content creators are rewarded for their contribution according to a framework that provides incentives in the form of both reputation and monetization. Blockchain technology is used to certify the content's authenticity and compensate content creators with a cryptographic token. We illustrate the technical choices of the solution together with its software architecture and implemented platform. In particular, we introduce the framework used to validate the trustworthiness of user-generated content and favor fairness and transparency within the platform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technologies have been used to facilitate Web 3.0 and FinTech applications. However, conventional blockchain technologies suffer from long transaction delays and low transaction success rates in some Web 3.0 and FinTech applications such as Supply Chain Finance (SCF). Blockchain sharding has been proposed to improve blockchain performance. However, the existing sharding methods either use a static sharding strategy, which lacks the adaptability for the dynamic SCF environment, or are designed for public chains, which are not applicable to consortium blockchain-based SCF. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive consortium blockchain sharding framework named ACSarF, which is based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed framework can improve consortium blockchain sharding to effectively reduce transaction delay and adaptively adjust the sharding and blockout strategies to increase the transaction success rate in a dynamic SCF environment. Furthermore, we propose to use a consistent hash algorithm in the ACSarF framework to ensure transaction load balancing in the adaptive sharding system to further improve the performance of blockchain sharding in dynamic SCF scenarios. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments in a typical SCF scenario. The obtained experimental results show that the ACSarF framework achieves a more than 60% improvement in user experience compared to other state-of-the-art blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose a Cross-Chain Mapping Blockchain (CCMB) for scalable data management in massive Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, CCMB aims to improve the scalability of securely storing, tracing, and transmitting IoT behavior and reputation data based on our proposed cross-mapped Behavior Chain (BChain) and Reputation Chain (RChain). To improve off-chain IoT data storage scalability, we show that our lightweight CCMB architecture efficiently utilizes available fog-cloud resources. The scalability of on-chain IoT data tracing is enhanced using our Mapping Smart Contract (MSC) and cross-chain mapping design to perform rapid Reputation-to-Behavior (R2B) traceability queries between BChain and RChain blocks. To maximize off-chain to on-chain throughput, we optimize the CCMB block settings and producers based on a general Poisson Point Process (PPP) network model. The constrained optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and solved using a dual-network Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. Simulation results validate CCMB's scalability advantages in storage, traceability, and throughput. In specific massive IoT scenarios, CCMB can reduce the storage footprint by 50% and traceability query time by 90%, while improving system throughput by 55% compared to existing benchmarks.",

This has raised consumers awareness towards monitoring the resources of their food consumption. Nevertheless, greenwashing and deceptive food labels are prevalent leading to sales of items with misaligned labels, underpinning the need to authenticate, trace, and track the agricultural supply chain from the farm to shop. Consumers should be able to select fresh produce and verify its origin through a transparent, trustworthy, accountable, and reliable process. This paper introduces a blockchain-based solution that leverages intrinsic features of this innovative and disruptive technology to harness transparency, reliability, authenticity, and accountability within an agricultural supply chain. Additionally, our solution eliminates misleading food labels on fresh produce by enabling consumers to reliably trace and verify the origin and authenticity of the food source in a transparent manner. Through the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), the well-being of the soil, air, and crops is consistently monitored. The sustainable solutions employed are transparent, aligning with the standards set by various sustainable food certifications and agencies, including organic, non-Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), and Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). The paper presents detailed algorithms that represent the smart contract code, sequence diagrams along with testing results and security analysis. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.",

Building upon the foundations of PoAh consensus, this enhanced iteration, known as PoAh 2.0, integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the block creator node level. This novel approach allows for the generation of block transactions embedded with AI-determined sensitivity and other applicable transaction-related metadata, a pioneering concept in this domain. The verifier node, a trusted entity, is tasked with verifying incoming blocks, utilizing the block header and its metadata information to determine authenticity while preserving the privacy of the content of the blockâs data. A core innovation of PoAh 2.0 is its dynamic authentication mechanism, which adapts to the sensitivity level of the data within each block, behaving in an adaptive way based on the situation. AI plays a crucial role in this process, ensuring the blockâs integrity and security are maintained. To demonstrate the efficacy of this advanced AI-enabled PoAh 2.0 consensus, we conducted a case study in an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based eHealth scenario. The results from this study reveal that our developed dynamic authentication technique not only significantly enhances the original PoAh version but also establishes a new benchmark in block validation and security for eHealth applications. The integration of AI and improved dynamic authentication, calibrated to the security needs of each block, marks a novel and significant stride in blockchain research. This development not only enriches the current understanding of blockchain applications in IoT, but also sets a new direction for future research in secure and efficient blockchain implementations in the IoMT-Edge centric eHealth landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe process of reaching an agreement on a value within a distributed network, known as a consensus problem, is a defining feature of blockchain. This consensus problem can be seen in various applications like load balancing, transaction validation in blockchain, and distributed computing. In recent years, many researchers have provided solutions to this problem. Hence we have presented a survey in which we delved into blockchain consensus algorithms and conducted a comparative analysis of all the consensus algorithms to provide information about each protocolâs advantages and drawbacks. This survey starts with the standard proof-of-work consensus protocol applied in bitcoin cryptocurrency and its limitations on the ground of the following parameters: throughput (transactions per second), latency, forks, fault tolerance, double spending attacks, and power consumption. The rest of the consensus algorithms in this paper have been systematically covered to address the limitations of proof-of-work. This paper also covered Raft and PBFT consensus algorithms suitable for permissioned networks. Although the PBFT consensus protocol has a high throughput and a low latency, it has limited node scalability. The PBFT has a low byzantine fault tolerant rate. This paper also covers PoEWAL for blockchain-based IoT applications and WBFT, which prevents corrupt nodes from taking part in consensus. A comparative analysis of the consensus algorithms provides an explicit knowledge of the present research, which also offers guidance for future study.",

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platformâs potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.",

This paper addresses critical vulnerabilities in the architecture of CN and data security by proposing a novel framework based on blockchain technology that is specifically designed for communication networks. Traditional centralized network architectures are vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, particularly in roaming scenarios where there is also a risk of private data leakage, which imposes significant operational demands. To address these issues, we introduce the Blockchain-Enhanced Core Network Architecture (BECNA) and the Secure Decentralized Identity Authentication Scheme (SDIDAS). The BECNA utilizes blockchain technology to decentralize data storage, enhancing network security, stability, and reliability by mitigating Single Points of Failure (SPoF). The SDIDAS utilizes Decentralized Identity (DID) technology to secure user identity data and streamline authentication in roaming scenarios, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches during cross-network transmissions. Our framework employs Ethereum, free5GC, Wireshark, and UERANSIM tools to create a robust, tamper-evident system model. A comprehensive security analysis confirms substantial improvements in user privacy and network security. Simulation results indicate that our approach enhances communication CNs security and reliability, while also ensuring data security.",

Crypto funds (CFs) create value by smoothing frictions on decentralized digital platforms (DDPs). CF-backed DDPs obtain higher valuations in the primary token market, outperform their peers after issuing tokens, and benefit from token price appreciation around CF investment disclosure in the secondary market. Primary transaction data from the Ethereum ledger shows that the valuations of DDPs with meager adoption and a higher centralization of token ownership benefit more from CF backing. The positive valuation and performance effects for CF-backed DDPs are more pronounced for CFs that are more central in investor networks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe multi-keyword sorted searchable encryption is a practical and secure data processing technique. However, most of the existing schemes require each data owner to calculate and store the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) value, and then dynamically summarize them into a global IDF value. This not only hinders efficient sharing of massive data but also may cause privacy disclosure. Additionally, using a cloud server as storage and computing center can compromise file integrity and create a single point of failure. To address these challenges, our proposal leverages the complex interactive environment and massive data scenarios of the supply chain to introduce a fast and accurate multi-keyword search scheme based on blockchain technology. Specifically, encrypted files are first stored in an Interplanetary File System (IPFS), while secure indexes are stored in a blockchain to eliminate single points of failure. Moreover, we employ homomorphic encryption algorithms to design a blockchain-based index tree that enables dynamic adaptive calculation of IDF values, dynamic update of indexes, and multi-keyword sorting search capabilities. Notably, we have specifically designed a two-round sorting search mode called âMatch Sort + Score Sortâ for achieving fast and accurate searching performance. Furthermore, fair payment contracts have been implemented on the blockchain to incentivize data sharing activities. Through rigorous safety analysis and comprehensive performance evaluation tests, our scheme has been proven effective as well as practical.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe present a consensus mechanism in this paper that is designed specifically for supply chain blockchains, with a core focus on establishing trust among participating stakeholders through a novel reputation-based approach. The prevailing consensus mechanisms, initially crafted for cryptocurrency applications, prove unsuitable for the unique dynamics of supply chain systems. Unlike the broad inclusivity of cryptocurrency networks, our proposed mechanism insists on stakeholder participation rooted in process-specific quality criteria. The delineation of roles for supply chain participants within the consensus process becomes paramount. While reputation serves as a well-established quality parameter in various domains, its nuanced impact on non-cryptocurrency consensus mechanisms remains uncharted territory. Moreover, recognizing the primary role of efficient block verification in blockchain-enabled supply chains, our work introduces a comprehensive reputation model. This model strategically selects a leader node to orchestrate the entire block mining process within the consensus. Additionally, we innovate with a Schnorr Multisignature-based block verification mechanism seamlessly integrated into our proposed consensus model. Rigorous experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance and feasibility of our pioneering consensus mechanism, contributing valuable insights to the evolving landscape of blockchain technology in supply chain applications.",

Common concerns by both customers and financial institutions are the secure authentication measures for protecting sensitive financial information from cybersecurity threats and maintaining their trust in a secure environment. This paper presents a blockchain-supported scheme to establish secure authentication and mutual trust for handling online banking processes. The proposed solutionâs model design, inference process, proof method, security analysis, and performance evaluation are included in this study. With the decentralized applications and smart contracts, that benefit from disruptive innovations in blockchain technology, the proposed scheme enables financial institutions to provide efficient, immutable, transparent, and secure online financial services for customers. In addition, the computational efforts of the proposed solution show that high performance can be achieved in executing financial transactions while safeguarding sensitive data and retaining trust in a decentralized environment which is some of the most significant weak security of the existing authentication schemes for online banking platforms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNon-functional requirements related to safety, security, and timeliness have made cyberâphysical systems (CPS) initially reluctant to their integration with blockchain technology. Despite the multiple advantages of blockchain like improved data security and traceability, the main reasons that have slowed down its adoption in CPS still remain. Examples of these are the inherent overhead of accessing the distributed ledger and the security incidents that a number of blockchain networks have suffered since its inception. This paper presents VelogCPS, a novel middleware that guarantees that logic and data managed by blockchain networks of cyberâphysical systems are verified and generated by legitimate sources. Thus, VelogCPS avoids a kind of security incidents that impact the authenticity and integrity of the logic and data managed in blockchain networks. By authenticity we refer to provenance authenticity of the involved smart contracts, i.e., the perfect matching between the advertised source-code and the version deployed to the network. Our framework provides a safe blockchain network as it ensures that the entities that participate to a CPS use solely authentic logic. We do this by leveraging block verifier services and enforcing them through the operation workflow. As a result, the middleware guarantees that the participating entities use and share authentic logic. The proposed framework is validated through its implementation on a real blockchain network, employing actual smart contract verifier logic, and through the exhaustive analysis of the temporal behaviour and overhead of the major operations; the obtained results ensure its utility for time-sensitive sytems like CPS and IoT.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has been widely used in finance, the Internet of Things (IoT), supply chains, and other scenarios as a revolutionary technology. Consensus protocol plays a vital role in blockchain, which helps all participants to maintain the storage state consistently. However, with the improvement of network environment complexity and system scale, blockchain development is limited by the performance, security, and scalability of the consensus protocol. To address this problem, this paper introduces the collaborative filtering mechanism commonly used in the recommendation system into the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and proposes a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol based on collaborative filtering recommendation (CRBFT). Specifically, an improved collaborative filtering recommendation method is designed to use the similarity between a nodeâs recommendation opinions and those of the recommender as a basis for determining whether to adopt the recommendation opinions. This can amplify the recommendation voice of good nodes, weaken the impact of cunning malicious nodes on the trust value calculation, and make the calculated results more accurate. In addition, the nodes are given voting power according to their trust value, and a weight random election algorithm is designed and implemented to reduce the risk of attack. The experimental results show that CRBFT can effectively eliminate various malicious nodes and improve the performance of blockchain systems in complex network environments, and the feasibility of CRBFT is also proven by theoretical analysis.",

Building on studies on the embeddedness of urban digital platforms with a local character, this article studies how the app under consideration is shaped by, and adapted to, the needs and resources of local socio-economic contexts. Two pilot experimentations on the app are considered, concerning systems for rewarding civic participation and urban sharing economies. The empirical analysis concerns the methodology for introducing the app into local socio-economic contexts, the way in which local actors interpret its properties, and the resulting iterative co-design of its functionalities. The article defines and discusses the extent to which the civic blockchain is rendered context-based by this methodology, and highlights similarities and differences with other urban digital platforms. The empirical evidence drawn from this research contributes to the debate on how community members, researchers and digital experts together can realise alternative forms of urban digitalization.",

Erroneous data feedback can significantly impact vehicle operations, control, and overall safety, necessitating the assurance of security in vehicular data aggregation. Addressing the security risks and challenges inherent in data aggregation within VANETs, this paper introduces a blockchain-based scheme for secure and anonymous data aggregation. The proposed scheme integrates cloud computing with blockchain technology, presenting a novel blockchain-based data aggregation system that robustly supports efficient and secure data collection in VANETs. Leveraging key escrow resilience mechanisms, the solution ensures the security of system keys, preventing the security problems caused by keys generated by third parties alone in the past. Furthermore, through secondary data aggregation, fine-grained data aggregation is achieved, providing effective support for cloud services in VANETs. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed through security analysis and performance evaluations, demonstrating superior computational and communication efficiency compared existing alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the presence of malicious nodes (MNs) poses significant challenges to data integrity, network stability, and system reliability. These issues are intensified by energy resource constraints and limitations within centralized authentication systems, necessitating an energy-efficient solution to ensure real-time responsiveness. Although artificial intelligence-driven approaches enhance detection capabilities, they overcome challenges related to data volume, coordination overhead, and latency in centralized control. This study introduces blockchain-machine learning (BC-ML), a novel hybrid model that seamlessly integrates blockchain and machine learning (ML) techniques to effectively identify MNs in WSNs. The model establishes an energy-efficient blockchain among cluster heads (CHs) for robust node authentication, incorporating a Schnorr-like zero-knowledge-proof technique to validate node data during communication initiation. Utilizing a hybrid lightweight approach with both symmetric and asymmetric ciphers enhances the security of node data transmission. A new proof-of-authority method is introduced, which leverages node digital certificates instead of conventional data transactions. This consensus mechanism reduces the processing overhead associated with larger data sizes in traditional proof-of-work methods, thereby improving both energy efficiency and scalability. To address dataset imbalances, the model employs a hybrid unsupervised ML technique, combining adaptive synthetic sampling with a convolutional neural network for efficient analysis of nodes and network features. The ML model, hosted on a robust data server, ensures ongoing oversight by updating CHs with security levels for detected MNs, thereby reducing storage and mitigating coordination challenges. Comprehensive analyses validate the effectiveness of the BC-ML model for detecting MNs, optimizing resource utilization, minimizing delays, and prolonging node and network lifetimes. Security analysis further confirms the ability of the model to mitigate diverse attacks and meet the stringent WSN security requirement.",

Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) model is widely used in cloud data sharing scenarios, but there are problems such as privacy leakage of access policy, irrevocability of user or attribute, key escrow, and trust bottleneck. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-assisted CP-ABE (B-CP-ABE) mechanism for trusted data access control. Firstly, we construct a data trusted access control architecture based on the B-CP-ABE, which realizes the automated execution of access policies through smart contracts and guarantees the trusted access process through blockchain. Then, we define the B-CP-ABE scheme, which has the functions of policy partial hidden, attribute revocation, and anti-key escrow. The B-CP-ABE scheme utilizes Bloom filter to hide the mapping relationship of sensitive attributes in the access structure, realizes flexible revocation and recovery of users and attributes by re-encryption algorithm, and solves the key escrow problem by joint authorization of data owners and attribute authority. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of the B-CP-ABE scheme by performing security analysis and performance analysis.",

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain.\nWhile solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria.\nDespite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.",

    "abstract": "As an open network architecture, Wireless Computing Power Networks (WCPN) pose new challenges for achieving efficient and secure resource management in networks, because of issues such as insecure communication channels and untrusted device terminals. Blockchain, as a shared, immutable distributed ledger, provides a secure resource management solution for WCPN. However, integrating blockchain into WCPN faces challenges like device heterogeneity, monitoring communication states, and dynamic network nature. Whereas Digital Twins (DT) can accurately maintain digital models of physical entities through real-time data updates and self-learning, enabling continuous optimization of WCPN, improving synchronization performance, ensuring real-time accuracy, and supporting smooth operation of WCPN services. In this paper, we propose a DT for blockchain-empowered WCPN architecture that guarantees real-time data transmission between physical entities and digital models. We adopt an enumeration-based optimal placement algorithm (EOPA) and an improved simulated annealing-based near-optimal placement algorithm (ISAPA) to achieve minimum average DT synchronization latency under the constraint of DT error. Numerical results show that the proposed solution in this paper outperforms benchmarks in terms of average synchronization latency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAnticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact.\nThis research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.",

However, the decentralized and anonymous nature of these currencies can also be (ab)used for nefarious activities such as money laundering, thus reinforcing the importance of designing tools to effectively detect malicious transaction misbehaviors. In this paper, we propose TMAS, a transaction misbehavior analysis scheme for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the proposed system includes ten features in the transaction graph, two heuristic money laundering models, and an analysis method for account linkage, which identifies accounts that are distinct but controlled by an identical entity. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed indicators and models, we analyze 100 million transactions and compute transaction features, and are able to identify a number of suspicious accounts. Moreover, the proposed methods can be applied to other cryptocurrencies, such as token-based cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoins) and account-based cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum).",

In the low-carbon industry, positioning affective features of the products effectively gives firm a competitive edge. By applying blockchain to online product communities (OPCs), firms can gain insights into consumers' affective requirements during product positioning. In this study, we develop a game-theoretic framework to explore how to optimize affective design of low-carbon products with blockchain application. We find that firms' affective product design depends on two conflicting forces. On one hand, blockchain adoption in OPCs enhances estimation precision, motivating firms to provide mass products that meet mainstream marketplace requirements. On the other hand, blockchain implementation improves estimation similarity, inducing firms to target niche markets. The network effect exacerbates these two conflicting forces, and the trade-off between them determines firms' product design decisions. Additionally, we examine the impacts of blockchain adoption on firms' profits, environmental performance, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We discover that blockchain application in OPCs is always socially beneficial. However, blockchain adoption's effect on economic and environmental performance, as well as consumer surplus, is contingent on the significance of the conflicting forces. We further conduct a survey and in-depth interviews to validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the 6th Generation (6G) wireless communication network as a vital component of Ubiquitous Learning, which makes it possible to build trustworthy relationships and accurate intelligence in a variety of contexts. The important significance of blockchain technology is recognized, and its potential to improve the performance of the 6G network is investigated. Blockchain technology powers Ubiquitous Learning as a decentralized tool. But in Ubiquitous Learning contexts, problems arise when varied communication settings, information asymmetry, and resource limits confront wireless-connected devices functioning as blockchain consensus nodes. To solve these difficulties, which are critical for Ubiquitous Learning, a blockchain sharding and incentive system is presented. The purpose of this technique is to improve the learning process in the 6G network by cultivating reliable intelligence. A sharding architecture that integrates a contract theory-based incentive mechanism and a realistic Byzantine fault tolerance mechanism, particularly tailored for Ubiquitous Learning settings, is described. This model analyses the useful Byzantine consensus mechanism and block broadcast characteristics in wireless networks. This study finds the best contract combination for both completely symmetric and asymmetric information scenarios, optimizing block rewards for customers that seek blockchain services.",

The proposed scheme aims to address the limitations of existing digital watermarking techniques, such as dependence on third-party platforms, by leveraging the decentralization feature of blockchain. The Smart Contract is used to manage the transaction between the parties involved in the watermarking process, while IPFS is used to store the watermark data. The enhanced FWHT algorithm is used to embed the watermark into the host image without affecting its visual quality. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both imperceptibility and robustness. Additionally, it demonstrates that our scheme can effectively resist various attacks. Therefore, our scheme can be a promising solution for image copyright protection, authentication applications, and image trading.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (220KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

However, traditional authentication approaches are vulnerable due to the transmission of identity information between UAVs and cryptographic paradigm management centers over a public channel. These vulnerabilities include brute-force attacks, single point of failure, and information leakage. Blockchain, as a decentralized distributed ledger with blockchain storage, tamper-proof, secure, and trustworthy features, can solve problems such as single-point-of-failure and trust issues, while the hidden communication in the physical layer can effectively resist information leakage and violent attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight UAV network authentication mechanism that leverages blockchain and covert communication, where the identity information is transmitted as covert tags carried by normal modulated signals. In addition, a weight-based Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (wPBFT) consensus protocol is devised, where the weights are determined by the channel states of UAVs and the outcomes of past authentication scenarios.

    "abstract": "With the development of Industry 4.0 and big data technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is hampered by inherent issues such as privacy, security, and fault tolerance, which pose certain challenges to the rapid development of IIoT. Blockchain technology has immutability, decentralization, and autonomy, which can greatly improve the inherent defects of the IIoT. In the traditional blockchain, data is stored in a Merkle tree. As data continues to grow, the scale of proofs used to validate it grows, threatening the efficiency, security, and reliability of blockchain-based IIoT. Accordingly, this paper first analyzes the inefficiency of the traditional blockchain structure in verifying the integrity and correctness of data. To solve this problem, a new Vector Commitment (VC) structure, Partition Vector Commitment (PVC), is proposed by improving the traditional VC structure. Secondly, this paper uses PVC instead of the Merkle tree to store big data generated by IIoT. PVC can improve the efficiency of traditional VC in the process of commitment and opening. Finally, this paper uses PVC to build a blockchain-based IIoT data security storage mechanism and carries out a comparative analysis of experiments. This mechanism can greatly reduce communication loss and maximize the rational use of storage space, which is of great significance for maintaining the security and stability of blockchain-based IIoT.",

It is projected to play an important role in the future energy market by increasing the incentive to own and operate distributed energy resources (DERs) and participate in demand response (DR). A common approach to implementing P2P trading is with blockchain, however, existing solutions feature limitations. Typically, concerns involve either scalability and high transaction costs or projects implementing a permissioned blockchain that does not provide the trust and decentralization desired. In addition, the majority of market designs are simplified and do not capture the distinct complexity of electricity markets. They do not consider the inter-temporal constraints of appliances and DERs that need to run for multiple periods. Complex market designs that address these issues have not been implemented in blockchain based systems due to the computational limitations of such systems. To improve these two aspects, this paper proposes a market formulation that supports products running multiple periods with flexible scheduling, modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem that optimizes social welfare. The trading platform is then implemented as a side chain of Polkadot, a network of blockchains designed to be secure, scalable, and economically feasible to foster an ecosystem of application-specific sidechains. This design is demonstrated to improve social welfare and achieve scalability by benchmarking the number of transactions that can be included per second, based upon typical assumptions of the market size. The result is a decentralized and performant system that allows for complex market designs to be implemented in a blockchain environment. This approach simplifies the process for participants, allowing them to bid DER or DR devices, directly and easily, even when this requires constraints across periods.",

    "abstract": "As big data, Artificial Intelligence, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication have advanced, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are being developed to enable efficient and safe transportation systems. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), which is one of the services included in ITS systems, is an automated system that allows vehicles to pass through toll plazas without stopping for manual payment. The ETC system is widely deployed on highways due to its contribution to stabilizing the overall traffic system flow. To ensure secure and efficient toll payments, designing a distributed model for sharing toll payment information among untrusted toll service providers is necessary. However, the current ETC system operates under a centralized model. Additionally, both toll service providers and toll plazas know the toll usage history of vehicles. It raises concerns about revealing the entire driving routes and patterns of vehicles. To address these issues, blockchain technology, suitable for secure data management and data sharing in distributed systems, is being applied to the ETC system. Blockchain enables efficient and transparent management of ETC information. Nevertheless, the public nature of blockchain poses a challenge where usersâ usage records are exposed to all participants. To tackle this, we propose a blockchain-based toll ticket model named AnonymousTollPass that considers the privacy of vehicles. The proposed model utilizes traceable ring signatures to provide unlinkability between tickets used by a vehicle and prevent the identity of the vehicle using the ticket from being identified among the ring members for the ticket. Furthermore, malicious vehiclesâ identities can be traced when they attempt to reuse tickets. By conducting simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed model and demonstrate that gas fees required for executing the proposed smart contracts are only 10% (when the ring size is 50) of the fees required in previous studies.",

We propose a method to Detect Influencers in Network AutoRegressive models (DINAR) via sparse-group regularization to detect regions influencing others across borders. For a granular analysis, we analyse whether the transaction size plays a role in the dynamics of the cross-border transactions in the network. With two-layer sparsity, DINAR enables discovering (1) the active regions with influential impact on the global digital money network and (2) whether changes in the size of the transaction affect the dynamic evolution of Bitcoin transactions. In the analysis of real data of the Bitcoin blockchain from Feb 2012 to December 2021, we find that influence from certain regions is linked to the economic need to use BTC, such as to circumvent sanctions, avoid high inflation, and to carry out transactions through off-shore markets. The effects are robust to different groupings, evaluation periods, and choices of regularization parameters.",

Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.",

    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks provide message transmission capabilities for blockchain systems. Improving data transmission efficiency in P2P networks can greatly enhance the performance of blockchain systems. However, traditional blockchain P2P networks face a common challenge where there is often a mismatch between the upper-layer traffic requirements and the underlying physical network topology. This mismatch results in redundant data transmission and inefficient routing, severely constraining the scalability of blockchain systems. To address these pressing issues, we propose FPSblo, an efficient transmission method for blockchain networks. Our inspiration for FPSblo stems from the Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) algorithm, a well-established technique widely utilized in point cloud image processing. In this work, we analogize blockchain nodes to points in a point cloud image and select a representative set of nodes to prioritize message forwarding so that messages reach the network edge quickly and are evenly distributed. Moreover, we compare our model with the Kadcast transmission model, which is a classic improvement model for blockchain P2P transmission networks, the experimental findings show that the FPSblo model reduces 34.8% of transmission redundancy and reduces the overload rate by 37.6%. By conducting experimental analysis, the FPS-BT model enhances the transmission capabilities of the P2P network in blockchain.",

This study delves into the interconnectedness between AI and pivotal sectors such as cryptocurrency, blockchain, metaverse, democratized banking, and Cleantech, among others. Employing the conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) and time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) methods, we scrutinize daily data spanning from June 1, 2018, to October 11, 2023, encompassing 12 stock indices representing each industry. Our findings unveil a strong contagion effect from AI to other innovative sectors, with the exception of Cleantech, which appears to have decoupled from the AI surge. Notably, democratized banking and the metaverse emerge as key recipients of this contagion. Examination of tail-risk spillovers highlights AI as one of the most influential risk transmitters during market tumult, while cryptocurrency and blockchain consistently function as net risk receivers throughout the sample period. The implications of these findings are multifaceted, offering substantive insights into the risk profiles of these critical innovative sectors. Investors and regulatory bodies stand to benefit significantly from this analysis, as it illuminates potential avenues for portfolio diversification and deepens understanding of contagion mechanisms within these evolving industries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe wide use of sensors in healthcare applications has made it necessary to have secure communication in healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The sensor data is sensitive, and can contain extremely confidential information such as medical diagnosis, clinical records, vital signs and health data of patients. The emergence of blockchain as a technology ensures consensus and trust among systems, and is now considered to be a new trend used to achieve high scalability, data integrity and privacy. Federated learning is a new technology based on distributed learning that exploits the concept of trust. In federated learning, each user builds an individual distributed model to help a central server that is accessible only to a trusted user group. This paper harnesses the potential of these approaches and proposes an attack detection model to discern normal user behaviours from that of adversaries in an IoT network. This model is called the Blockchain enabled Federated Learning model for secured communication in healthcare IoT (BFL-hIoT), to secure data in healthcare IoT networks. This model is trained and tested on a standard dataset and demonstrates the highest classification accuracy of 97.16 % for normal, 0.9546 for backdoors, 0.9618 for XSS etc., outperforming other blockchain and deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "Traditional blockchain key management schemes store private keys in the same location, which can easily lead to security issues such as a single point of failure. Therefore, decentralized threshold key management schemes have become a research focus for blockchain private key protection. The security of private keys for blockchain user wallet is highly related to user identity authentication and digital asset security. The threshold blockchain private key management schemes based on verifiable secret sharing have made some progress, but these schemes do not consider participantsâ self-interested behavior, and require trusted nodes to keep private key fragments, resulting in a narrow application scope and low deployment efficiency, which cannot meet the needs of personal wallet private key escrow and recovery in public blockchains. We design a private key management scheme based on rational secret sharing that considers the self-interest of participants in secret sharing protocols, and constrains the behavior of rational participants through reasonable mechanism design, making it more suitable in distributed scenarios such as the public blockchain. The proposed scheme achieves the escrow and recovery of personal wallet private keys without the participation of trusted nodes, and simulate its implementation on smart contracts. Compared to other existing threshold wallet solutions and key management schemes based on password-protected secret sharing (PPSS), the proposed scheme has a wide range of applications, verifiable private key recovery, low communication overhead, higher computational efficiency when users perform one-time multi-key escrow, no need for trusted nodes, and personal rational constraints and anti-collusion attack capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of distributed renewable energy penetration is promoting the evolution of the energy system toward decentralization and decentralized and digitized smart grids. This study was based on energy blockchain, and developed a dual-biding mechanism based on the real-time energy surplus and demand in the local smart grid, which is expected to enable reliable, affordable, and clean energy supply in smart communities. In the proposed system, economic benefits could be achieved by replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity with the high penetration of affordable solar PV electricity. The reduction of energy surplus realized by distributed energy production and P2P energy trading, within the smart grid results in less transmission loss and lower requirements for costly upgrading of existing grids. By adopting energy blockchain and smart contract technologies, energy secure trading with a low risk of privacy leakage could be accommodated. The prototype is examined through a case study, and the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed mechanism are further validated by scenario analysis.",

Therefore, mitigating the risk posed by coding errors is crucial, necessitating the development of approaches to enhance human reliability in coding. The Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) is one such approach, examining how environmental conditions affect the human error probability (HEP). Within CREAM, Common Performance Conditions (CPCs) influence error probability. This study ranks CPCs in smart contract coding based on their importance in coding reliability using the Bayesian Best Worst Method (BWM). Two methods are developed based on basic CREAM. In the first method, experts specify the control mode based on their opinions, and the probability of expertsâ coding errors is determined according to the control level. In the second method, an optimization problem is formulated to select the most suitable programs, enhancing expertsâ coding reliability. The proposed model considers energy, cost, and organizational budget factors to identify the optimal smart contract while minimizing the risks and costs associated with human errors. A case study in the electronics supply chain validates the applicability and efficacy of the proposed methods. Results from the first method indicate an opportunistic control mode. In contrast, the proposed model shows that improving CPC levels has a more significant effect, shifting the control mode towards a tactical control and reducing HEP to 0.00249.",

To do so, we conducted a multiple case study through the lens of agency theory. Three Swiss companies which are carrying out blockchain projects for their supply chain have been analyzed in semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Two significant findings of the impact on principal-agent relationships are stressed. Firstly, blockchain technologies can reduce the asymmetry of information, increase the control of agents, and consequently minimize the trust in the principal towards the agents. Secondly and paradoxically, the control mechanisms inherent in these technologies can decrease the agent's trust in the principal. Thus, questioning trust is necessary, both as an antecedent and an unexpected consequence when adopting blockchain technologies. Finally, we provide guidelines for initiating the adoption of blockchain technologies in supply chains.",

When evaluating the level of decentralization, the key metric for most public blockchain networks is the degree of decentralization of the resources responsible for determining who generates the blocks. In turn, it facilitates a greater understanding of both security and scalability on a blockchain. This work provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art on wealth decentralization, which has not yet received the attention it deserves. We collect data, calculate various wealth decentralization metrics, and compare our results with research on the same methodology. As the amount of data for various blockchains increases rapidly, it is helpful to have techniques to aggregate data for statistical analysis. We introduce and provide conservative estimates of decentralized group metrics based on the reduced data and compare them with full-data measurements. Our research considers both the Layer 1 blockchains of Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon.",

Integrating blockchain technology into decentralized FL frameworks is critical to establishing the trust necessary for user participation. However, existing FL systems using blockchain often struggle with scalability, latency, and privacy issues, particularly in permissionless blockchain contexts. This paper proposes OpenFL, a novel, collateral-backed reputation system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to foster trust among participants in a decentralized FL environment. We present a fully autonomous smart contract platform specifically tailored to facilitate FL processes among anonymous users. Furthermore, we address potential security concerns by detailing our strategies to mitigate various attack vectors. To validate our systemâs efficacy, we conducted experiments on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our findings demonstrate OpenFLâs capability to overcome the inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains while highlighting the significance of open-access protocols in this context. OpenFL can potentially broaden the participant base in trust-sensitive applications by reducing entry barriers, thus substantially contributing to decentralized machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPharmaceutical supply chain management (PSCM) aims to alleviate logistical challenges. However, traditional online pharma systems face issues during implementation, particularly regarding transparency and fostering mutual trust among stakeholders. The primary security goals for a supply chain management (SCM) solution are ensuring authentication, confidentiality, data provenance, and auditability. The proposed blockchain-based solution (BPSCM) is implemented in three phases: registration, pharmaceutical product circulation, and secure payment. The registration phase computes the identification number upon the hashed private key along with the Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) for all the stakeholders. The pharm product circulation phase implements the transactions among the participants by developing smart contracts where cryptographic operators ensure data provenance. The security analysis demonstrates that the framework effectively mitigates impersonation and collusion attacks. Performance metrics, including gas consumption, throughput, latency, and computational cost, were examined and compared to standard PSCM frameworks to evaluate the BPSCM's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standard inter-domain routing protocol for the Internet that conveys network layer reachability information and establishes routes to different destinations. The BGP protocol exhibits security design defects, such as an unconditional trust mechanism and the default acceptance of BGP route announcements from peers by BGP neighboring nodes, easily triggering prefix hijacking, path forgery, route leakage, and other BGP security threats. Meanwhile, the traditional BGP security mechanism, relying on a public key infrastructure, faces issues like a single point of failure and a single point of trust. The decentralization, anti-tampering, and traceability advantages of blockchain offer new solution ideas for constructing secure and trusted inter-domain routing mechanisms. In this paper, we summarize the characteristics of BGP protocol in detail, sort out the BGP security threats and their causes. Additionally, we analyze the shortcomings of the traditional BGP security mechanism and comprehensively evaluate existing blockchain-based solutions to address the above problems and validate the reliability and effectiveness of blockchain-based BGP security methods in mitigating BGP security threats. Finally, we discuss the challenges posed by BGP security problems and outline prospects for future research.",

However, despite its growing importance, there exists a significant knowledge gap in the holistic understanding of its integration and impact within this sector. Addressing this gap, the current study employs a pioneering approach, marking it as the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis in this field. We have systematically examined 390 journal articles from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 2017 through the end of February 2024, to map the current landscape and thematic trajectories of blockchain technology in renewable energy. The findings highlight several critical thematic areas, including blockchain's integration with smart grids, its role in electric vehicle integration, and its application in sustainable urban energy systems. These themes not only illustrate the diverse applications of blockchain but also its substantial potential to revolutionize energy systems. This study not only fills a crucial gap in existing literature but also sets a precedent for future interdisciplinary research in this domain, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications to fully harness the potential of blockchain in the renewable energy sector.",

Due to data leakage from user information, it is critical to keep the data confidential and completely protected because criminals are looking for this information to attack the system or steal information in the banking sector. To address this issue, this paper suggests an Integrated Blockchain and Artificial intelligence (IBAI) Framework for secure financial transactions. A blockchain can store every customer's data in one place, while AI-driven algorithms can speedily examine that data and make an unbiased decision. The rising blockchain technology provides a decentralized architecture that enables the secure sharing of data and resources to the different networks and is promoted for removing centralized control and resolving the problems of AI. When suspicious behaviour happens, alerts can be triggered to avert theft. Furthermore, registration protocols based on AI are utilized to keep this data in comprehensive security. The numerical results show that the suggested IBAI model enhances the suspicious behaviour detection ratio and increases accuracy up to 98% compared to other models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRecently, big data related to human movement, air quality, and meteorology have been generated in urban computing through sensing technology and the computing infrastructure. However, security problems arise as data utilization increases. If the sensing data from internet of things devices are constantly exposed, the usersâ private information can be determined, a critical security risk that could result in privacy breaches. This paper proposes a secure data processing system using the blockchain and differential privacy for data security and privacy protection in urban computing. When a service provider requests information, the system generates it from urban computing data using machine learning. We apply differential privacy to these data to protect privacy. However, if a query repeats, differential privacy may provide insufficient privacy protection. Therefore, we reduce the total privacy cost by reusing noise for the same data and privacy parameters using the blockchain. Machine learning accuracy may decrease when noisy data are used for training. Thus, we increase accuracy by storing and appropriately using the model parameters generated by the same data in the blockchain. We design, simulate, and analyze the results of an experimental environment for reusing noise for differential privacy and parameter utilization of machine learning using the blockchain. The proposed approach reduces privacy costs compared to the existing mechanism while protecting data privacy. We demonstrate that, through parameter utilization, the accuracy improves compared to conventional mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology, with its attributes of decentralization, immutability, and traceability, has emerged as a powerful catalyst for enhancing traditional industries in terms of optimizing business processes. However, transaction performance and scalability has become the main challenges hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain. Due to its inability to meet the demands of high-frequency trading, blockchain cannot be adopted in many scenarios. To improve the transaction capacity, researchers have proposed some on-chain scaling technologies, including lightning networks, directed acyclic graph technology, state channels, and sharding mechanisms, in which sharding emerges as a potential scaling technology. Nevertheless, excessive cross-shard transactions and uneven shard workloads prevent the sharding mechanism from achieving the expected aim. This paper proposes a graph-based sharding scheme for public blockchain to efficiently balance the transaction distribution. By mitigating cross-shard transactions and evening-out workloads among shards, the scheme reduces transaction confirmation latency and enhances the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Therefore, the scheme can achieve a high-frequency transaction as well as a better blockchain scalability. Experiments results show that the scheme effectively reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio to a range of 35%â56% and significantly decreases the transaction confirmation latency to 6 s in a blockchain with no more than 25 shards.",

We consider AML compliance as a superset of know-your-customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring capabilities. We carried out this research with Danske Bank and Concordium, using internal documents and interviews that served as empirical data. We show how storing digital representations of verified IDs with a blockchain can automate tasks and reduce redundant verification in KYC onboarding. Blockchain transparency also improves identifying counterparties, determining funds sources, and creating alerts in transaction monitoring. These reduce time and labor costs for AML compliance, which may lead to smaller banks. When more banks commit to layer-1 blockchain technology, the benefits of blockchain-based AML will increase. We carried out this theory-based qualitative research and encourage ECRA readers to recognize that the emerging technology innovations we study in this article have not yet been widely adopted and implemented by financial services firms. We also include a theoretical model with study hypotheses to make the main constructs that we investigate easily understood by non-technical ECRA readers. The findings we have developed are consistent with early-stage exploration in our research context and are intended to encourage more well-developed empirical results as the passage of time permits such work to be undertaken.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFor safer roads, a more efficient driving experience, and protection against attackers, the intelligent cars communicate with one another or with the roadside unit (RSU). The fundamental security requirements of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) must be nonrepudiable, genuine, and incorporate these three. Additionally, protecting against attackers should be done in particular specific situations. However, the VANET's main disadvantages are its centralized design and the absence of procedures for ensuring confidentiality and privacy. In this paper, proposed decentralised consensus blockchain architecture for VANET that uses blockchain technology to address these problems. The VANET no longer needs a central authority or third-party administration thanks to the introduction of the blockchain. In order to ensure data integrity and accelerate up system processing, the hash value of the pseudonyms will be recorded on the blockchain. By eliminating trust difficulties between the entities, this effectively addresses challenges that arise in centralised designs. The suggested method for VANETs security. Experimental investigation demonstrates that the provided architecture outperforms the available options in terms of security enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe increasing penetration of renewable sources introduces new challenges for power systemsâ stability, especially for isolated systems characterized by low inertia and powered through a single diesel power plant, such as it happens in small islands. For this reason, research projects, such as the BLORIN project, have focused on the provision of energy services involving electric vehicles owners residential users to mitigate possible issues on the power system due to unpredictable generation from renewable sources. The residential users were part of a blockchain-based platform, which also the Distributors/Aggregators were accessing. This paper describes the integrated framework that was set up to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of some of the methodologies developed in the BLORIN project for fast frequency response in isolated systems characterized by low rotational inertia. The validation of the proposed methodologies for fast frequency response using Vehicle-to-Grid or Demand Response programs was indeed carried out by emulating the dynamic behavior of different power resources in a Power Hardware-in-the-Loop environment using the equipment installed at the LabZERO laboratory of Politecnico di Bari, Italy. The laboratory, hosting a physical microgrid as well as Power Hardware-in-the-Loop facilities, was integrated within the BLORIN blockchain platform. The tests were conducted by assuming renewable generation development scenarios (mainly photovoltaic) and simulating the system under the worst-case scenarios caused by reduced rotational inertia. The experiments allowed to fully simulate usersâ interaction with the energy system and blockchain network reproducing realistic conditions of tracking and remuneration of usersâ services. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the BLORIN platform for the provision, tracking and remuneration of grid services by electric vehicles and end users, and the benefits that are achieved in terms of reducing the number of diesel generating units that need to be powered on just to provide operational reserve due to the penetration of renewable sources, resulting in fuel savings and reduced emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nImage tamper detection is a challenging area in multimedia research. The advances in photography technology have made it possible to capture real-time high-dynamic-range (HDR) images through an iPhone or an Android device, which highlights the need for rigorous research on HDR images for tamper detection, and localization. The algorithms built for standard images may affect the watermark visibility when it is applied to HDR images as this produces high perceptual variations in the image compared to the original. To tackle this problem, we presented a Proof of Work consensus blockchain watermarking scheme combined with a convolution attention model (PoWBWM) system for tamper detection and localization. The system utilizes a Convolution Attention model (CoAtNet) to generate robust watermarks. A quaternion graph-based transform (QGBT) for embedding, ensuring imperceptibility and robustness. A fuzzy inference system optimizes embedding regions and factors based on human visual system characteristics. The system's security is enhanced through blockchain's proof-of-work (consensus) mechanism, providing a semi-blind watermarking scheme that authenticates ownership and detects tampering efficiently. The security is ensured only when the embedded hash key is authentic with its previous block to proceed further extraction process. The proposed algorithm's performance is evaluated in terms of its visibility by Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and the perceptual quality of an HDR image is additionally measured by the Visual Dynamic Predictor (VDP) metric. On the other hand, the robustness performance is measured by Normalized Correlation Coefficient (NCC) and Bit Error Rate (BER). The experimental results for CASIA images achieved the highest PSNR value of 63.84â¯dB, and the SSIM value of 1.000, whereas the maximum VDP value obtained for HDR images is 98.02. In comparison with the existing system, the experimental findings of the suggested model show an effective tamper detection watermarking system as well as a robust against both intentional and unintentional attacks with an average NCC value of 0.98.",

Medical and healthcare data encounter challenges like data silos, privacy breaches, and transmission latency. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a blockchain-based framework for trustworthy medical data sharing in edge computing environments. Leveraging healthcare consortium edge blockchains, this framework enables fine-grained access control to medical data. Specifically, it addresses the real-time, multi-attribute authorization challenge in CP-ABE through a Distributed Attribute Authorization strategy (DAA) based on blockchain. Furthermore, it tackles the key security issues in CP-ABE through a Distributed Key Generation protocol (DKG) based on blockchain. To address computational resource constraints in CP-ABE, we enhance a Distributed Modular Exponentiation Outsourcing algorithm (DME) and elevate its verifiable probability to â1â. Theoretical analysis establishes the IND-CPA security of this framework in the Random Oracle Model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for resource-constrained end-user devices in edge computing environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe implementation of blockchain technology in integrated IoT networks for constructing scalable Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) in India has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach transportation. By leveraging the power of IoT and blockchain, we can create a highly secure, transparent, and efficient system that can transform the way we move people and goods. India, one of the worldâs most populous countries, has a highly congested and inefficient transportation system that often leads to delays, accidents, and waste of time and resources. The integration of IoT and blockchain can help address these issues by enabling real-time monitoring, tracking, and optimization of traffic flows, thereby reducing congestion, improving safety, and increasing the overall efficiency of the transportation system. This paper explores the potential of blockchain technology in the context of integrated IoT networks for constructing scalable ITS systems in India. The methodology followed is to develop a proof-of-concept blockchain-based application for ITS, implement the blockchain solution into the existing ITS infrastructure, and ensure proper integration and compatibility with other systems. Conduct thorough research and maintenance to ensure the reliability and sustainability of such blockchain-based systems. This research discusses the various benefits and challenges of this approach and the various applications of this technology in the transportation sector, including the green sustainability concept. The results find various ways in which such implementations of blockchain and IoT-Machine Learning (IoT-ML) can revolutionize transportation systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 5.0 applications and associated services have caused a powerful transition in the cyber threat landscape. As a result, organisations require new ways to proactively manage the risks associated with their infrastructure. In response, a significant amount of research has focused on developing efficient Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing. However, in many cases, CTI contains sensitive information that has the potential to leak valuable information or cause reputational damage to the sharing organisation. While a number of existing CTI sharing approaches have utilised blockchain to facilitate privacy, it can be highlighted that a comprehensive approach that enables dynamic trust-based decision-making, facilitates decentralised trust evaluation and provides CTI producers with highly granular sharing of CTI is lacking. Subsequently, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based CTI sharing framework, called Priv-Share, as a promising solution towards this challenge. In particular, we highlight that the integration of differential sharing, trustless delegation, democratic group managers and incentives as part of Priv-Share ensures that it can satisfy these criteria. The results of an analytical evaluation of the proposed framework using both queuing and game theory demonstrate its ability to provide scalable CTI sharing in a trustless manner. Moreover, a quantitative evaluation of an Ethereum proof-of-concept prototype demonstrates that applying the proposed framework within real-world contexts is feasible.",

Conventional blockchain models aimed at increasing scalability but often it is limited by its capacity and performance. The machine learning algorithms aim to determine the parameters of the blockchain that finds the optimal value required to obtain an increased scalability without any limitations in its performance. In this paper, a machine learning model called Block Chain-Support Vector Machine (BC-SVM) is integrated with the blockchain to improve the process of communication in a secure way. Here Modified elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory and may be utilised for creating cryptographic keys more quickly and efficiently, increasing security. The machine learning model optimizes the necessary security parameters required to transfer the data in a secure way. The experimental validation shows an increased scalable task allocation than its predecessors.",

This research addresses this challenge by identifying and prioritising information needs within sustainable food supply chains. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study identified 14 information needs, categorised them into three clusters: a) product and quality details information, b) production and processing information, and c) sustainability information, and prioritised the information needs. Experts highly prioritised information needs on quality and safety, followed by product origin and nutrition/ingredients. The research suggests that blockchain technology can play a role in supporting consumer decision-making. These findings can inform the development of information-sharing systems that enhance transparency and support consumer decision-making in sustainable food supply chains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nInadequate information sharing and difficult information diffusion are the main factors that cause upstream and downstream enterprises to default on supply chain finance. Blockchain technology, which exploits distributed storage and a consensus mechanism, can provide effective solutions to overcome these problems such as information sharing. When blockchain technology is adopted by the enterprises that comprise the supply chain finance business, this technology shows a diffusion trend. As a result, the decision pertaining to the application of novel technologies is affected. Therefore, to investigate the diffusion mechanism pertaining to the blockchain technology that is applied in supply chain finance, the study exploited the idea of a class of SEIR infectious disease models, and built a blockchain model that considers the supply chain financial system. Besides, the study verifies the stability of the model by constructing a Lyapunov function. The results indicate that the basic reproduction number determines the proliferation of the blockchain technology. When the basic reproduction number is less than 1, the proliferation of the blockchain technology that is applied in supply chain finance system would terminate. By contrast, when the basic reproduction number is greater than 1, during the average infection period, the number of non-adopting enterprises that accept the blockchain technology becomes greater than 1, which can maintain a continuous impact on supply chain finance system. Over time, the number of enterprises that accept blockchain technology tends to be stable. Through numerical simulations that consider the influencing parameters pertaining to the basic regeneration number, which has important effect on blockchain technology diffusion, we enlarge the diffusion efficiency and increase the transfer rate of potential on-chain enterprises or decrease the default exit rate. As a result, we facilitate the diffusion of blockchain technology in the system.",

The current carbon reduction is mainly based on supply side, but the effect is limited. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a coordinated supplyâdemand carbon emission reduction strategy based on blockchain technology. Based on the carbon emission reduction of complementary thermal power and renewable energy under the carbon trading mechanism of power supply side, users are made to participate in the individual level carbon trading mechanism with the help of blockchain technology, and the carbon emission reduction in power demand side is guided through the market mechanism, thus forming a supplyâdemand collaborative carbon emission reduction strategy of source side control and terminal inhibition. By analyzing the decision changes of both the supply and demand sides of electricity before and after the introduction of blockchain, quantifying the influence of blockchain on electricity quantity, electricity price and usersâ utility in turn, and establishing the personal carbon trading mechanism supported by blockchain, a game model of two-side interaction between supply and demand was constructed. The simulation results show that the collaborative carbon emission reduction strategy based on blockchain gives full play to the potential of carbon reduction in power demand side, and the personal carbon trading mechanism can better inhibit terminal carbon emissions, which is conducive to the deep carbon emission reduction of the power industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology offers immense potential for increasing efficiency by streamlining business operations. However, blockchain implementation is disruptive and requires high capital organizational processes as it fundamentally re-engineers and automates business processes. By integrating blockchain with Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs), organizations can enjoy the benefits of blockchain adoption with minimal disruption to their business model. The resources regarding integration of blockchain systems and ERP are scarce and dispersed as their applications are in different niches. Thus, there is a need for a study of literature that investigates blockchain and ERP integration and find its key success factors. This systematic literature review (SLR) investigates the key success factors of blockchain and ERP integration and finds the context of integration to derive meaningful insights regarding its application in different functional areas. A list of key success factors is identified. They could be broadly classified into three contexts â technological, organizational, and regulatory. Also important is the environment and sustainability of the integration. This study was able to conclude that the integration of ERP systems with blockchain will enhance the capabilities of current ERP systems by providing value propositions of the decentralized ledgers such as increased transparency, trust, and process automation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, its full potential remains inaccessible to a broader audience due to its complexity, which requires expertise in training and designing DRL solutions, high computational capabilities, and sometimes access to pre-trained models. This necessitates the need for hassle-free services that increase the availability of DRL solutions to a variety of users. To enhance the accessibility to DRL services, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based crowdsourced DRL as a Service (DRLaaS) framework. The framework provides DRL-related services to users, covering two types of tasks: DRL training and model sharing. Through crowdsourcing, users could benefit from the expertise and computational capabilities of workers to train DRL solutions. Model sharing could help users gain access to pre-trained models, shared by workers in return for incentives, which can help train new DRL solutions using methods in knowledge transfer. The DRLaaS framework is built on top of a Consortium Blockchain to enable traceable and autonomous execution. Smart Contracts are designed to manage worker and model allocation, which are stored using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure tamper-proof data distribution. The framework is tested on several DRL applications, proving its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe surge in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks within SDN environments demands more potent defense strategies. While Moving Target Defense (MTD) holds promise, current MTD approaches against DDoS suffer from security gaps due to overwhelming malicious traffic and static detection areas. In order to tackle these difficulties, we have implemented BSDN-HMTD, a combination of deep learning and blockchain technologies within SDN environments, as a framework. Our strategy starts by employing blockchain technology to authenticate users. We use the NTRU-based Nyberg Rueppel Digital Signature Algorithm for this purpose. This ensures that only authenticated user flows are allowed for validation and forwarding. Within the forwarding layer, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) evaluate authentic flows by analyzing many characteristics, effectively differentiating between regular, malicious, and dubious flows. Utilizing an Enhanced Spotted Hyena Optimization (EHSO) method to activate switches in real-time modifies the vulnerable points of attack, so impeding attackers and simultaneously decreasing energy usage. The Forwarding Layer Organizer (FLO) oversees the detection of possible attacker surveillance activities and transmits the collected information to local controllers in the control layer. The controllers, functioning in a structured controller network, carry out proactive Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques, such as host virtual IP hopping, which make attacker plans more complex and raise their operational expenses. Reactive MTD actions are implemented based on the results of flow validation. These actions utilize techniques such as secure honeypots and host virtual IP hopping to effectively prevent attacks. The blockchain securely logs all processed data related to packet validation, authentication, and honeypot activities to ensure the protection of data privacy. Our studies, conducted using Network Simulator-3.26 (NS-3.26), show that our proposed framework outperforms existing techniques in terms of several validation criteria.",

Research shows that integration of these cutting-edge technologies is in its infancy, specifically in the areas of embracing broader data, model verification, behavioural reliability and model explainability for intelligent credit assessment. The conventional credit risk assessment process utilises historical application data. However, reliable and dynamic transactional customer data are necessary for robust credit risk evaluation in practice. Therefore, this research proposes a framework for integrating blockchain and XAI to enable automated credit decisions. The main focus is on effectively integrating multi-party, privacy-preserving decentralised learning models with blockchain technology to provide reliability, transparency, and explainability. The proposed framework can be a foundation for integrating technological solutions while ensuring model verification, behavioural reliability, and model explainability for intelligent credit assessment.",

To date, the literature tends to discuss blockchain's advantages rather than how early enterprise adopters and innovators experience and perceive the technology. As such, the extent of technology diffusion is not well understood. This study critically explores the factors influencing blockchain diffusion in tourism and how blockchain innovation is diffused in tourism. We conducted semistructured interviews with founders and senior executives of tourism enterprises in the United States and Europe who are early adopters and innovators of blockchain in tourism. From the thematic analysis, our empirical findings indicate that blockchain has much to offer despite the nascent link between blockchain's business value to an enterprise's strategic plans and the limited success of use cases in tourism. We summarize the findings in a conceptual framework and offer propositions based on the antecedents (motivators and drivers and challenges and barriers) of blockchain diffusion of innovation for enterprises to achieve competitive advantage. The propositions provide a research agenda to guide the strategic implementation of blockchain.",

We propose that blockchain technology could address these issues. To this end, we explain its potential by elaborating on how blockchain-based sharing services can help solve exploitation, data abuse, financial and legal risks, and the limited accessibility of current sharing practices. Moreover, we conduct a meansâend chain analysis to provide a customerâs perspective on the motivations and fears related to blockchain-based sharing solutions. We find four motives (trust, self-determination, quality of life, and security) and two fears (mistrust and economic interest) related to blockchain-based sharing. By juxtaposing the potential benefits of blockchain-based shared services with customer insights, we provide an outline of research avenues for promoting blockchain-based sharing to overcome the current dark side of sharing practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany proposals have arisen to integrate a patientâs health information produced by different heterogeneous sources. Ones trying to physically integrate this information and others making interoperable the data that remain stored in current health systems. Interoperable approaches have become the preferred solutions because of data security and privacy constraints, and blockchain technology is currently being used for integrating distributed health data. However, despite many approaches for performing such integration, there are unresolved issues around them such as the definition of who should keep this data structure alive and who should manage access to it. This makes difficult for health institutions to keep the global vision of patientâs always up to date. This paper offers a new patient-centered solution to achieve a global view of patient health that we call Personal Health Trajectory (PHT), which makes use of the blockchainsâ federation concept. We provide a reference implementation architecture of PHT that has been validated over a case study on 50 sociosanitary institutions with 1156 patients. We have obtained a delay of 2.87s in write operations and 0.16s in reading onesâregarding the separate interaction with each health institution, which is not significant with respect to the benefits obtained.",

The current study focuses on sustainable and green supply practices in different stages of supply chain management and how they can be facilitated by blockchain technology (BT). The study has addressed the existing gaps in the area namely, the lack of research assessing stage-wise green supply chain for environmental performance focusing on BT. The current study aims to assess the impact of BT on different stages of the green supply chain and a firm's environmental performance. The study also focuses on analyzing the impact of green supply chain stages on environmental performance. The study uses PLS-based structural equation modelling approach to investigate the hypothesised relationships between BT adoption and stage-wise green supply chain practices. The data was collected from individuals from medium-sized enterprises from the manufacturing industry in India. The findings reveal a positive association between blockchain adoption and green supply chain management practices leading to enhancement in environmental performance.

    "abstract": "With the development of technology, the connected vehicle has been upgraded from a traditional transport vehicle to an information terminal and energy storage terminal. The data of ICV (intelligent connected vehicles) is the key to organically maximizing their efficiency. However, in the context of increasingly strict global data security supervision and compliance, numerous problems, including complex types of connected vehicle data, poor data collaboration between the IT (information technology) domain and OT (operation technology) domain, different data format standards, lack of shared trust sources, difficulty in ensuring the quality of shared data, lack of data control rights, as well as difficulty in defining data ownership, make vehicle data sharing face a lot of problems, and data islands are widespread. This study proposes FADSF (Fuzzy Anonymous Data Share Frame), an automobile data sharing scheme based on blockchain. The data holder publishes the shared data information and forms the corresponding label storage on the blockchain. The data demander browses the data directory information to select and purchase data assets and verify them. The data demander selects and purchases data assets and verifies them by browsing the data directory information. Meanwhile, this paper designs a data structure Data Discrimination Bloom Filter (DDBF), making complaints about illegal data. When the number of data complaints reaches the threshold, the audit traceability contract is triggered to punish the illegal data publisher, aiming to improve the data quality and maintain a good data sharing ecology. In this paper, based on Ethereum, the above scheme is tested to demonstrate its feasibility, efficiency and security.",

Blockchain technology significantly improves energy management by creating supply chain resiliency in a distributed smart grid. This study proposes a blockchain-based decision-making framework with a dynamic energy pricing model to manage energy distributions, particularly during an energy crisis. Empirical data from U.S. consumers are employed to show the applicability of the proposed model. We include price elasticity to address changes in energy market prices. Findings revealed that the proposed framework reduces total energy costs and performs better when a disruption has occurred. This study provides a post hoc analysis in which four machine learning algorithms are used to predict energy consumption. Results suggest that the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm has the highest accuracy compared to other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of this study is to investigate methodologies concerning enterprise financial sharing and risk identification to mitigate concerns associated with the sharing and safeguarding of financial data. Initially, the analysis examines security vulnerabilities inherent in conventional financial information sharing practices. Subsequently, blockchain technology is introduced to transition various entity nodes within centralized enterprise financial networks into a decentralized blockchain framework, culminating in the formulation of a blockchain-based model for enterprise financial data sharing. Concurrently, the study integrates the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm with the transformer model, presenting an enterprise financial risk identification model referred to as the BiLSTM-fused transformer model. This model amalgamates multimodal sequence modeling with comprehensive understanding of both textual and visual data. It stratifies financial values into levels 1 to 5, where level 1 signifies the most favorable financial condition, followed by relatively good (level 2), average (level 3), high risk (level 4), and severe risk (level 5). Subsequent to model construction, experimental analysis is conducted, revealing that, in comparison to the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm mechanism, the proposed model achieves a throughput exceeding 80 with a node count of 146. Both data message leakage and average packet loss rates remain below 10 %. Moreover, when juxtaposed with the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) algorithm, this model demonstrates a risk identification accuracy surpassing 94 %, an AUC value exceeding 0.95, and a reduction in the time required for risk identification by approximately 10 s. Consequently, this study facilitates the more precise and efficient identification of potential risks, thereby furnishing crucial support for enterprise risk management and strategic decision-making endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise in the cost of essentials affects every nation around the world, but it has become a major concern for developing nations. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.",

To enhance trading efficiency and pricing fairness, as the major challenges of P2P market designs, this study introduces two new market mechanisms, Hybrid Auction Coalition (HAC), and innovative coalition business model (ICBM), respectively. The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellersâ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.",

This article focuses on the use of blockchain technology to address the issue of false freshness reporting in a two-level fresh supply chain consisting of a rural cooperative and a supermarket. Taking into account the dual losses of quality and quantity in the process of agricultural products transportation, the impacts of the product freshness and the blockchain investment level on random market demand are quantified in this paper. And game models for centralized and decentralized decision-making before and after investing in blockchain technology are proposed. By comparing the supply chain optimal decisions and performances under different scenarios, a revenue-cost sharing contract is designed to coordinate the decentralized decision-making. Simulation results show that the application of the blockchain technology can further consolidate the superiority of the centralized decision-making. However, there is a certain threshold for the application of the blockchain technology in decentralized decision-making. When the unit cost of blockchain exceeds the threshold, the rural cooperative will abandon its cooperation with the supermarket due to reduced profits. And the combined contract also has a threshold boundary for its coordinating effect on decentralized decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs the use of blockchain for digital payments continues to rise, it becomes susceptible to various malicious attacks. Successfully detecting anomalies within blockchain transactions is essential for bolstering trust in digital payments. However, the task of anomaly detection in blockchain transaction data is challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of illicit transactions. Although several studies have been conducted in the field, a limitation persists: the lack of explanations for the model's predictions. This study seeks to overcome this limitation by integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques and anomaly rules into tree-based ensemble classifiers for detecting anomalous Bitcoin transactions. The shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method is employed to measure the contribution of each feature, and it is compatible with ensemble models. Moreover, we present rules for interpreting whether a Bitcoin transaction is anomalous or not. Additionally, we introduce an under-sampling algorithm named XGBCLUS, designed to balance anomalous and non-anomalous transaction data. This algorithm is compared against other commonly used under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. Finally, the outcomes of various tree-based single classifiers are compared with those of stacking and voting ensemble classifiers. Our experimental results demonstrate that: (i) XGBCLUS enhances true positive rate (TPR) and receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) scores compared to state-of-the-art under-sampling and over-sampling techniques, and (ii) our proposed ensemble classifiers outperform traditional single tree-based machine learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, TPR, and false positive rate (FPR) scores.",

Recognising the weaknesses of earlier approaches such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFS), we work\n-ROFS to better accommodate imprecise input. Novel approaches that use into metaverse settings are being investigated as a means of addressing the complex problems associated with urban mobility. This study use the SWARA-AROMAN approach to evaluate potential blockchain integration possibilities for metaverse urban mobility. Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility. To enhance urban transportation solutions in the dynamic metaverse, future strategies should concentrate on improving processes and exploring novel technology. Ultimately, this research emphasises how critical it is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing innovation if we hope to influence the patterns of urban mobility in the metaverse.",

It disrupted industries such as health, education, manufacturing, and banking. However, the increasing popularity of Blockchain ex- poses the scalability issues of major public blockchain platforms (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) and dramatically affects its development. The scalability problem manifests in terms of Low throughput, high transaction latency, and massive energy consumption. Several reviews and studies cover these factors and their potential solutions, yet these studies need to highlight more information through actual application to natural systems or projects. This study investigates all relevant papers on current research solutions for public blockchain scalability issues. The scope of this paper is to explore the implementation of different state-of-the-art scalability solutions to natural systems and projects while simultaneously highlighting the results. This study discusses the methods and techniques used and the challenges encountered that have yet to future researchers must explore.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized conventional trade. The success of blockchain can be attributed to its distributed ledger characteristic, which secures every record inside the ledger using cryptography rules, making it more reliable, secure, and tamper-proof. This is evident by the significant impact that the use of this technology has had on people connected to digital spaces in the present-day context. Furthermore, it has been proven that blockchain technology is evolving from new perspectives and that it provides an effective mechanism for the intelligent transportation system infrastructure. To realize the full potential of the accurate and efficacious use of blockchain in the transportation sector, it is essential to understand the most effective mechanisms of this technology and identify the most useful one. As a result, the present work offers a priority-based methodology that would be a useful reference for security experts in managing blockchain technology and its models. The study uses the hesitant fuzzy analytical hierarchy process for prioritizing the different blockchain models. Based on the findings of actual performance, alternative solution A1 which is Private Blockchain model has an extremely high level of security satisfaction. The accuracy of the results has been tested using the hesitant fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution procedure. The study also uses guidelines from security researchers working in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntegrating sharded blockchain with IoT presents a solution for trust issues and optimized data flow. Sharding boosts blockchain scalability by dividing its nodes into parallel shards, yet it is vulnerable to the 1% attacks where dishonest nodes target a shard to corrupt the entire blockchain. Balancing security with scalability is pivotal for such systems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) adeptly handles dynamic, complex systems and multi-dimensional optimization. This paper introduces a Trust-based and DRL-driven (TbDd) framework, crafted to counter collusion attack risks and dynamically adjust node allocation, enhancing throughput while maintaining network security. With a comprehensive trust evaluation mechanism, TbDd discerns node types and performs targeted resharding against potential threats. The TbDd framework maximizes the tolerance for dishonest nodes, optimizes node movement frequency, ensures even node distribution in shards, and balances sharding risks. Extensive evaluations validate TbDdâs superiority over conventional random-, community-, and trust-based sharding methods in shard risk equilibrium and reducing cross-shard transactions.",

Nevertheless, achieving efficient interactivity and privacy protection of agricultural data remains a crucial issues. To address the above problems, we propose a blockchain-assisted federated learning-driven support vector machine (BAFL-SVM) framework to realize efficient data sharing and privacy protection. The BAFL-SVM is composed of the FedSVM-RiceCare module and the FedPrivChain module. Specifically, in FedSVM-RiceCare, we utilize federated learning and SVM to train the model, improving the accuracy of the experiment. Then, in FedPrivChain, we adopt homomorphic encryption and a secret-sharing scheme to encrypt the local model parameters and upload them. Finally, we conduct a large number of experiments on a real-world dataset of rice pests and diseases, and the experimental results show that our framework not only guarantees the secure sharing of data but also achieves a higher recognition accuracy compared with other schemes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has recently enhanced energy trading by providing a new low-cost, secure, and decentralized transaction mechanism. This paper proposes a new methodology for applying blockchain in energy trading for a hybrid microgrid. The proposed methodology accounts for droop-based hybrid microgrids. The active power droop for both AC and DC sub-grids are used to reflect the suppliers bidding. A bidding strategy is implemented to minimize the generation cost and therefore maximizes the social welfare. On the other hand, the reactive power droop for the AC sub-grids is utilized to minimize the power loss on the microgrid through bus voltage support. Further, the paper presents a power losses allocation approach for precisely allocating system losses to each node. A case study with many transactions is conducted. The results demonstrate the suggested frameworkâs efficacy in maximizing social welfare while minimizing system losses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the Internet of Things (IoT), a large number of devices are connected using a variety of communication technologies to ensure that they can communicate both physically and over the network. However, devices face the challenge of a single point of failure, a malicious user may forge device identity to gain access and jeopardize system security. In addition, devices collect and transmit sensitive data, and the data can be accessed or stolen by unauthorized user, leading to privacy breaches, which posed a significant risk to both the confidentiality of user information and the protection of device integrity. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems and realize the secure transmission of data, this paper proposed EBIAS, a secure and efficient blockchain-based identity authentication scheme designed for IoT devices. First, EBIAS combined the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm and the SHA-256 algorithm to achieve encrypted communication of the sensitive data. Second, EBIAS integrated blockchain to tackle the single point of failure and ensure the integrity of the sensitive data. Finally, we performed security analysis and conducted sufficient experiment. The analysis and experimental results demonstrate that EBIAS has certain improvements on security and performance compared with the previous schemes, which further proves the feasibility and effectiveness of EBIAS.",

However, the detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in blockchain has initiated a debate on whether this inherently trustless technology needs further trust support or not. In this work, we explore mutual trust and trustless cooperation. First, we examine blockchain-assisted trust management to highlight the specific trustless trait of blockchain. Then, as consensus is an important component of blockchain technology, we examine the role of trust in evaluating the trustworthiness of peer participants in the blockchain consensus process and enhancing the growth of a consistent chain. Finally, we derive research findings in the promising cooperation between trustless and trust.",

We manually collect blockchain-related announcements made by Chinese listed firms over 2016â2022 and conduct an event study to estimate market reaction. The announcements are further categorized as value-driven and speculation-driven announcements. Although both announcement types elicit positive short-term market reactions, the long-term reactions to speculation-driven announcements fade and even reverse, while the value-driven ones remain positive. Additionally, we determine that speculation-driven announcements are followed by seasoned equity offerings, negative news releases, and reductions in the stockholdings of large shareholders and executives, suggesting corporate executive opportunism. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of internal and external corporate governance in reducing corporate executive opportunism. Our study sheds light on market reactions to blockchain-related announcements from the perspective of executivesâ opportunism.",

This work presents two new blockchain-based techniques that take advantage of massive multiple input multiple output in a single-cell network to improve performance. NOMA power domain is used in the 5G cooperative cognitive radio network (CCRN) to improve the SE of the downlink. This study investigates a novel cooperative NOMA-based CCRN for underlay spectrum sharing. A cooperative NOMA technique is proposed by considering the access modes of relays and secondary users (SUs) on the secondary network. The proposed system's performance is assessed with respect to random channel characteristics, frequency-selective Rayleigh fading and perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The first signal decoded by SU identifies the relay states with the best channel quality between users and the destination users to offset the bit error rate. The throughput dropped during the period because of the perfect SIC. The precise closed-form expressions for the system throughput of the secondary network are derived under the interference constraint of the primary network to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested cooperative strategy. The suggested approaches are assessed under various conditions using the MATLAB application by considering varying transmit power levels, power location coefficients and lengths. In every case, four users are assumed to be using a 90 MHz bandwidth and M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation technology.",

However, due to the intermittent nature of such resources, the net energy availability within microgrids varies with time. This adversely affects the power balance within microgrids, especially if energy storage systems or grid support are unavailable. In such cases, the microgrids in a locality can form a network to trade power among themselves. The most transparent and fair method is power trading using a double auction with sealed bidding. A novel method for sealed bid power trading using consortium blockchains that is entirely decentralized is introduced, ensuring better operational and data security. Here, all bidding data are shared twice. During bidding time, bids are shared by participating microgrids using one-way encryption and are added to the blockchain by all participants. After the bid closure, the respective microgrids share the same data unencrypted. By encrypting and comparing the bid data with the encrypted data already added to the blockchains, other participants can verify whether the microgrids have kept their bid data unmodified post-bid-closure. If the data has been kept unmodified, all participants add the bid data as verified data to their blockchain. Successful bids are then identified using a smart contract, and power transfer is effected accordingly. All power and monetary transactions are recorded distributively in blockchains. A decentralised framework for the implementation of the method is also envisaged. Further, a novel approach is proposed for distributively authenticating the blocks shared by participating microgrids using public and shared keys. The method and the framework are then successfully tested for decentralization, transparency, resilience, public verifiability, and transaction enforcement using simulations in a benchmark test system for networked microgrids.",

Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts and analysed through the lens of the Interactive Communication Technology Adoption Model (ICTAM) as a guiding framework. The findings reveal that all factors of the ICTAM (system, audience, social, technology, adoption, and use) influence blockchain adoption simultaneously and often in contradictory ways. This study has several contributions. It is among the first to investigate blockchain adoption in online advertising, and from a communication perspective. It extends the application of the ICTAM to a whole ecosystem perspective and identifies which factors are essential for successful blockchain adoption in online advertising. The study concludes that while blockchain technology is a promising solution to challenges afflicting online advertising, more education about blockchainâs potential, favourable regulation, and ready-to-use applications are needed before wide-scale adoption can be realised.",

The country's tax policies are undergoing a significant shift to adapt to the burgeoning digital economy, with a keen focus on capturing and regulating the ever-expanding revenue streams generated through online enterprises. This research explored the potential of integrating blockchain technology with tax policy. Unstructured and semi-structured interview questions were designed to obtain insight into the problem. A survey was conducted to obtain views on the variables that explained the potential of integrating blockchain technology with tax policy to enhance the effectiveness of taxing online enterprises in Ghana. The study used correlation analysis to confirm propositions derived from preliminary interview and the review of literature. It was found that while blockchain offers significant advantages in bridging the gap for effective online taxation in Ghana, there are challenges which include institutional and regulatory conformity issues, technical integration and alignment incompatibility, and inadequate stakeholder engagement. This result may be useful in the design of tax online tax policy in Ghana and other jurisdictions with similar socio-economic environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe agriâfood supply chain has been a popular research topic in recent years. The combination of a demand for products of high quality and safety standards and the increasing number of stakeholders in supply chain networks has required the agriâfood business to transform from vertically integrated to vertically operated supply chain networks. Nevertheless, this traditional agriâfood supply chain form has exposure to some drawbacks. Meanwhile, blockchain technology as a disruptive technology today has the potential to provide valueâadded contributions towards multipleâdisciplinary applications. Blockchain technology gains success and proves its functionality in improving the current supply chain by ensuring traceability, transparency and efficiency across the network from farmer to consumer. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature on vertical coordination in the supply chain and its mechanism and to develop a framework that explores how blockchain technology can address the challenges in coordination mechanisms. Furthermore, taking the current Vietnamese vertical coordination cashew supply chain as a case study, this research is based on the proposed framework to suggest a solution combining blockchain and other relative technologies for the Vietnamese cashew business. This paper will close a research gap, as the blockchainâbased supply chain for Vietnam cashew nuts has potential benefits for each supply chain actor in terms of effectiveness in operations, costs and timeâsaving, and human resources.",

    "abstract": "Sharing data while protecting privacy in the industrial Internet is a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning methods require a combination of all data for training; however, this approach can be limited by data availability and privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) has gained considerable attention because it allows for decentralized training on multiple local datasets. However, the training data collected by data providers are often non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), resulting in poor FL performance. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach for sharing non-IID data in the industrial Internet using an FL approach based on blockchain technology. To overcome the problem of non-IID data leading to poor training accuracy, we propose dynamically updating the local model based on the divergence of the global and local models. This approach can significantly improve the accuracy of FL training when there is relatively large dispersion. In addition, we design a dynamic gradient clipping algorithm to alleviate the influence of noise on the model accuracy to reduce potential privacy leakage caused by sharing model parameters. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme using commonly used open-source image datasets. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy while protecting privacy and maintaining efficiency, thereby providing a new solution to data-sharing and privacy-protection challenges in the industrial Internet.",

This is because blockchain technology is built on trust and cannot be changed. The popularity of blockchain technology is increasing as it is trustworthy and cannot be changed; hence making traceability easier for information such as where food came from, thus essential for managing the agricultural food supply chain (SC). On the contrary, suggested SCM systems premised on smart contract technology and blockchain tend to be specifically apply to production and production processes. Through qualitative research, this paper suggests framework for adoption of smart contracts based on Ethereum in the agri-food SC, with the aim to establish means to adopt blockchain for checking food quality and origins in the agri-food supply chain. Remix IDE is utilised to build and test the smart contract. The significance of the framework is realised through ensuring the traceability of product safety and quality.",

By associating the attributes used for data encryption and access permissions, and giving full play to distributed and immutable characteristics of blockchain, secure and reliable data sharing and access control can be realized. The experimental results show that the encryption/decryption time based on blockchain ABE algorithm is 7-15 seconds, and the traditional method needs 14-20 seconds.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the continuous maturation of blockchain technology and the increasing demands for various industry applications, data sharing and interoperability among different blockchain networks face significant challenges. Research on cross-chain interoperability mechanisms has facilitated data collaboration across organizations and industries, enhancing the value and utility of data. When engaging in cross-chain data interactions, access control ensures the security and privacy of data while promoting collaboration and information exchange among multiple chains. Attribute-based access control can provide fine-grained authorization support, matching complex business scenarios. However, publicly disclosed policies and attributes in a transparent blockchain network may pose privacy and security issues. To address these issues, this paper proposes a cross-heterogeneous multichain data access control scheme based on attributes and threshold homomorphic encryption, achieving fine-grained and secure cross-domain access control in cross-chain networks. This scheme uses the threshold Paillier cryptosystem to encrypt and conceal user attributes and access policies. Through smart contracts, homomorphic differential computation is performed on the ciphertext of policies and attributes, to protect data privacy. This solution leverages private key decryption shares from multiple relay nodes in the cross-chain network to jointly decrypt the computation results, providing secure access control in complex cross-chain scenarios. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures security with reasonable computational overhead, to meet the access control requirements in cross-chain networks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn a service ecosystem, the trust of users in services serves as the foundation for maintaining normal interactions among users, service providers, and platforms. However, malicious attacks can tamper with the trust value of these services, making it difficult for users to identify reliable services and undermining the benefits of reliable service providers and platforms. When existing trust management models address the impact of malicious attacks on service reliability, they rarely consider leveraging different attack targets to improve the accuracy of compromised service trust. Therefore, we propose a trust enhancement model based on distributed learning and blockchain in the service ecosystem, which adaptively enhances the trust values of compromised services according to the targets of anomalous attacks. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the targets of malicious attacks using distributed learning. Secondly, we introduced a trust enhancement contract that utilizes different methods to enhance the trust of the service based on various attack targets. Finally, our approach outperforms the baseline method significantly. For different attack targets, we observe a reduction in RMSE by 12.38% and 12.12%, respectively, and an enhancement in coverage by 24.94% and 14.56%, respectively. The experimental results show the reliability and efficacy of our proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research paper seeks to examine the possibilities of blockchain technology. For use in the field of restaurant food tracking and safety. Public health risks and economic costs are at stake when foodborne illness outbreaks occur, making food safety a top priority in the food industry. It can be difficult to quickly identify and address possible concerns about using traditional food traceability systems due to inefficiencies, data discrepancies, and a lack of transparency. In this study, we introduce a novel blockchain-based system developed especially for the purpose of tracking restaurant food. Blockchain decentralised consensus, immutability, and smart contracts are put to use in this system to provide trustworthy and transparent traceable infrastructure. Real-time monitoring and data collection along the food supply chain become possible when the blockchain architecture is combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and RFID technology. We show that our proposed blockchain-based traceability solution is practical and efficient through a thorough assessment and validation procedure. The outcomes show that the system not only improves data quality and reliability but also drastically decreases the time and resources needed for food traceability. In addition, patrons are more likely to return to eateries that place a premium on food safety when they are given more information about the establishmentâs practises. Additionally, we discuss scalability, data privacy, and interoperability concerns that may arise in future implementations and provide some initial ideas for overcoming these issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, facial recognition technology has become increasingly integrated into society, making privacy protection crucial. Previous techniques offered minimal secrecy safeguards through simple obscuration methods. This paper addresses the strict privacy requirements of face image data by developing a novel framework that synergistically integrates Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), clustering algorithms, and Blockchain technology. The methodology proposes a cutting-edge Privacy-Preserving Self-Attention GAN (PPSA-GAN) to generate realistic synthetic facial imagery. An integrated mini-batch K-means clustering algorithm anonymizes these images into distinct groupings, maximizing privacy preservation. Blockchain integration complements the system by fortifying trust through decentralized ledgers for transparent yet secure data storage and auditing. Rigorous benchmarking on the CelebA dataset confirms the PPSA-GAN architectureâs state-of-the-art performance, attaining an impressive Inception Score of 13.99 and a FrÃ©chet Inception Distance of 35.50. The mini-batch clustering forms 125 distinct clusters, effectively anonymizing facial attributes within the synthetic images. Blockchain integration further bolsters privacy assurances via tamper-proof historical records, showcasing precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy values of 0.948, 0.938, 0.943, and 0.947, respectively. This multifunctional framework represents a novel contribution, fostering an ethical technological ecosystem that balances progress and privacy. Prospective deployment horizons encompass identity verification, surveillance infrastructure, and augmentation of medical image repositories, seeding an enlightening future for facial recognition domains.",

Since 2017, the use of Digital Twins has been increasing. However, in the road transport and logistics realm, the adoption rate remains low, primarily due to the costs of processing and validating data in centralised scenarios, among other factors. On the other hand, Blockchain technologies were created to provide immutable and decentralised data storage in diverse scenarios, adding a layer of isolation and reliability in heterogeneous solutions. This paper presents a case study proposing a Digital Twin based on open-source Blockchain technologies, such as FIWARE Canis Major. The primary goal is to design and implement a robust and efficient open-source architecture that allows for the control and optimisation of vehicle fleet allocations in logistics/transport companies within supply chain management. This case study aims to showcase the practical application of the proposed solution in a real-world context, providing insights into its eco-friendly and low-cost attributes while opening the door to a large number of additional applications.",

This study aims to investigate conflicting criteria in the blockchain technology (BT) platform selection process for decision-making under uncertainty. We propose a three-phase decision support framework to study BT adoption considering technological, organizational, and environmental contexts. In the first phase, after exploring the evaluation criteria from multiple contexts, the developed framework incorporates uncertainty and reliability to deal with the BT platform evaluation problem. Then, fuzzy cognitive map modeling, advanced by a Z-number-based inference system, is introduced to model the causal relationships between criteria. This is followed by implementing a hybrid learning algorithm to assess the impact of each criterion on adoption decisions. Finally, the fuzzy combined compromise solution embedded in the framework prioritizes BT platforms to identify the most suitable ones for sustainable SC. The findings imply that performance efficiency, implementation costs, maintainability and operability can significantly affect the BT platform selection decisions. The outcomes offer more stable, reliable, and distinguishable solutions for the proposed problem compared to the traditional approaches. The results introduce Hyperledger and R3 Corda as the best-fitting platforms for adoption based on the identified criteria.",

    "abstract": "With the rising adoption of blockchain technology due to its decentralized, secure, and transparent features, ensuring its resilience against network threats, especially Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, is crucial. This research addresses the vulnerability of blockchain systems to DDoS assaults, which undermine their core decentralized characteristics, posing threats to their security and reliability. We have devised a novel adaptive integration technique for the detection and identification of varied DDoS attacks. To ensure the robustness and validity of our approach, a dataset amalgamating multiple DDoS attacks was derived from the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. Using this, our methodology was applied to detect DDoS threats and further classify them into seven unique attack subcategories. To cope with the broad spectrum of DDoS attack variations, a holistic framework has been proposed that seamlessly integrates five machine learning models: Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The innovative aspect of our framework is the introduction of a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism, enhancing the systemâs adaptability. Experimental results substantiate the superiority of our ensemble method in comparison to singular models across various evaluation metrics. The framework displayed remarkable accuracy, with rates reaching 99.71% for detection and 87.62% for classification tasks. By developing a comprehensive and adaptive methodology, this study paves the way for strengthening the defense mechanisms of blockchain systems against DDoS attacks. The ensemble approach, combined with the dynamic weight adjustment, offers promise in ensuring blockchainâs enduring security and trustworthiness.",

    "abstract": "The use of privacy-enhanced facial recognition has increased in response to growing concerns about data security and privacy in the digital age. This trend is spurred by rising demand for face recognition technology in a variety of industries, including access control, law enforcement, surveillance, and internet communication. However, the growing usage of face recognition technology has created serious concerns about data monitoring and user privacy preferences, especially in context-aware systems. In response to these problems, this study provides a novel framework that integrates sophisticated approaches such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Blockchain, and distributed computing to solve privacy concerns while maintaining exact face recognition. The frameworkâs painstaking design and execution strive to strike a compromise between precise face recognition and protecting personal data integrity in an increasingly interconnected environment. Using cutting-edge tools like Dlib for face analysis, Ray Cluster for distributed computing, and Blockchain for decentralized identity verification, the proposed system provides scalable and secure facial analysis while protecting user privacy. The studyâs contributions include the creation of a sustainable and scalable solution for privacy-aware face recognition, the implementation of flexible privacy computing approaches based on Blockchain networks, and the demonstration of higher performance over previous methods.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDespite being proclaimed a âtrust-freeâ technology, the link between blockchain and interpersonal trust remains understudied. By considering one of the most prominent use-cases of blockchain - smart contracts, we argue that the non-punitive nature of smart contracts may facilitate trustworthy behavior in human interaction by encouraging trustees to view themselves as internally motivated cooperators and to honor the trustorâs move that exceeds the encoded response. We test this argument through an online experiment in which the hallmark property of smart contractsâautomated enforcementâis exploited. The results show that trustees in the experimental treatment return ten percentage points more than their counterparts in the trust treatment, thereby exhibiting a more trustworthy behavior. This experimental evidence shows that the presence of blockchain technology does not crowd out all properties of trusting behavior from human interactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in real estate investments that utilize blockchain technology. Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, the integration of blockchain technology with Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) has drawn the researcher attention because it can provide key security auditing and transaction traceability in the context of data sharing. However, in a majority of existing blockchain-based CP-ABE schemes, private keys were still issued by one central authority that would lead to heavy computation, higher transaction costs, and restricted scalability within the decentralized system. To address these challenges, we present an enhancement approach towards utilizing distributed key management service (KMS) and zero-knowledge paradigms. In our improved novel blockchain system model, we define two types of blockchain nodes for the CP-ABE scheme through staking mechanism. Firstly, the proxy re-encryption nodes are introduced to offer secure multi-party management and distribution of the CP-ABE's master secret key, eliminating dependence on a central authority and producing proofs of re-encryption correctness. Secondly, the operator nodes can collect all transactional information in blockchain-based CP-ABE scheme and then send the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) proofs to verify the batchâs integrity via smart contract. Subsequently, we employ the staking economic incentive model with reward determination and slashing in the decentralized blockchain system to ensure network security. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in achieving secure and efficient data sharing. Even amidst the pressure of 100 simultaneous transactions, the average response time for a single node remains at an approximate 28 s. Additionally, there is a notable decrease in on-chain gas consumption, with a gas reduction exceeding 61%. Comparative analyses further indicate that our blockchain-based CP-ABE scheme, in conjunction with a decentralized KMS, offers a superior balance between computational efficiency and functional capability.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain, known for its secure encrypted ledger, has garnered attention in financial and data transfer realms, including the field of energy trading. However, the decentralized nature and identity anonymity of user nodes raise uncertainties in energy transactions. The broadcast consensus authentication slows transaction speeds, and frequent single-point transactions in multi-node settings pose key exposure risks without protective measures during user signing. To address these, an alliance blockchain scheme is proposed, reducing the resource-intensive identity verification among nodes. It integrates multi-signature functionality to fortify user resources and transaction security. A novel multi-signature process within this framework involves neutral nodes established through central nodes. These neutral nodes participate in multi-signatureâs signing and verification, ensuring user identity and transaction content privacy. Reducing interactions among user nodes enhances transaction efficiency by minimizing communication overhead during verification and consensus stages. Rigorous assessments on reliability and operational speed highlight superior security performance, resilient against conventional attack vectors. Simulation shows that compared to traditional solutions, this scheme has advantages in terms of running speed. In conclusion, the alliance blockchain framework introduces a novel approach to tackle blockchainâs limitations in energy transactions. The integrated multi-signature process, involving neutral nodes, significantly enhances security and privacy. The schemeâs efficiency, validated through analytical assessments and simulations, indicates robustness against security threats and improved transactional speeds. This research underscores the potential for improved security and efficiency in blockchain-enabled energy trading systems.",

Concurrently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the Fourth Industrial Revolution by enabling interconnected devices to offer innovative services, ultimately enhancing human lives. This paper presents a new approach utilizing lightweight blockchain technology, effectively reducing the computational burden typically associated with conventional blockchain systems. By integrating this lightweight blockchain with IoT systems, substantial reductions in implementation time and computational complexity can be achieved. Moreover, the paper proposes the utilization of the Okamoto Uchiyama encryption algorithm, renowned for its homomorphic characteristics, to reinforce the privacy and security of IoT-generated data. The integration of homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology establishes a secure and decentralized platform for storing and analyzing sensitive data of the supply chain data. This platform facilitates the development of some business models and empowers decentralized applications to perform computations on encrypted data while maintaining data privacy. The results validate the robust security of the proposed system, comparable to standard blockchain implementations, leveraging the distinctive homomorphic attributes of the Okamoto Uchiyama algorithm and the lightweight blockchain paradigm.",

Despite a growing number of studies, the impact of BCT on supply chain relationships remains underexplored. This research identifies the salient elements of the link between BCT and relationships. It explores these empirically to understand the impact of BCT adoption and implementation on supply chain relationships in the agri-food industry, relying on social exchange theory and focusing on trust, formal information flow mechanisms, and quality of information flows and communication.\nThis study undertakes a multiple qualitative case study analysis of seven Italian companies involved in the agri-food industry operating in the wine, beer, and dairy sectors who are considered pioneers of BCT adoption. The results indicate a positive impact of BCT on the automation of supply chain contracts and operational efficiency, on one hand, and the increased quality of relationships, on the other. Supply chain coordination is required for BCT to be effective. In highly concentrated sectors, the contractual power exerted by big players is a vital factor, while in more fragmented and dispersed industries the role of persuasion, relationships, and supply chain contracts are key.\nThree key insights emerge and are discussed. These concern: (i) the rethinking of the role of trust in supply chain relationships impacted by the adoption of BCT; (ii) the enhancement of information-sharing and flow mechanisms in supply chain relationships through the adoption of BCT; and (iii) the optimization of information flow quality and communication dynamics through the adoption of BCT.\nThis study contributes to the existing literature by providing novel empirical evidence regarding the impact of BCT on relationships. It further contributes to the existing literature by analyzing the impact of blockchain applications on the upstream and downstream levels of the supply chain from a management perspective and by identifying the beneficial exchanges, norms, and principles that shape interactions when BCT is implemented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges around the world, including lockdowns, remote working and studying, and travel restrictions imposed by governments to curb the spread of the virus. As vaccines have become more widely available, restrictions have begun to ease for those vaccinated. Many countries use paper-based COVID-19 vaccination certificates to prove vaccination status. However, traditional certificates are vulnerable to forgery and counterfeiting. We developed a blockchain-based system where vaccination certificates are stored and accessed via smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain. The certificates are stored in a tamper-proof, decentralized manner, ensuring secure verification of vaccination status. This research project successfully designed and implemented a system that securely stores and verifies vaccination certificates using blockchain, demonstrating the benefits of this approach. According to our knowledge, this is the first kind of research initiative in Brunei to develop a blockchain-based immutable COVID-19 Vaccination certificate. Despite its advantages, blockchain still has its flaws, particularly in scalability and adoption, which should be considered for further optimization of the proposed system.",

During pandemic situations, citizens tend to develop panic about mass gatherings, which may influence the decrease in the number of votes. This urges a reliable, flexible, transparent, secure, and cost-effective voting system. The proposed online voting system using cloud-based hybrid blockchain technology eradicates the flaws that persist in the existing voting system, and it is carried out in three phases: the registration phase, vote casting phase and vote counting phase. A timestamp-based authentication protocol with digital signature validates voters and candidates during the registration and vote casting phases. Using smart contracts, third-party interventions are eliminated, and the transactions are secured in the blockchain network. Finally, to provide accurate voting results, the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism is adopted to ensure that the vote has not been modified or corrupted. Hence, the overall performance of the proposed system is significantly better than that of the existing system. Further performance was analyzed based on authentication delay, vote alteration, response time, and latency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIdentity-based threshold signature (IDTHS) allows a threshold number of signers to generate signatures to improve the deterministic wallet in the blockchain. However, the IDTHS scheme cannot determine the identity of malicious signers in case of misinformation. To solve this challenge, we propose an identity-based threshold (multi) signature with private accountability (for short AIDTHS) for privacy-preserving blockchain. From the public perspective, AIDTHS is completely private and no user knows who participated in generating the signature. At the same time, when there is a problem with the transaction, a trace entity can trace and be accountable to the signers. We formally define the syntax and security model of AIDTHS. To address the issue of identifying malicious signers, we improve upon traditional identity-based threshold signatures by incorporating zero-knowledge proofs as part of the signature and leveraging a tracer holding tracing keys to identify all signers. Additionally, to protect the privacy of signers, the signature is no longer achievable by anyone, which requires a combiner holding the keys to produce a valid signature. We give a concrete construction of AIDTHS and prove its security. Finally, we implement the AIDTHS scheme and compare it with existing schemes. The key distribution algorithm of AIDTHS takes 34.60\nand the signature algorithm takes 13.04 ms. The verification algorithm takes 1\n, which is one-third of the time the TAPS scheme uses.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (177KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFinance, supply chains, healthcare, and energy have an increasing demand for secure transactions and data exchange. Permissioned blockchains fulfilled this need thanks to the consensus protocol that ensures that participants agree on a common value. One of the most widely used protocols in private blockchains is the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), which tolerates up to one-third of Byzantine nodes, performs within partially synchronous systems, and has superior throughput compared to other protocols. It has, however, an important bandwidth consumption:\nmessages are exchanged in a system composed of N nodes to validate only one block.\nIt is possible to reduce the number of consensus participants by restricting the validation process to nodes that have demonstrated high levels of security, rapidity, and availability. In this paper, we propose the first database that traces the behavior of nodes within a system that performs PBFT consensus. It reflects their level of security, rapidity, and availability throughout the consensus. We first investigate different Single-Task Learning (STL) techniques to classify the nodes within our dataset. Then, using Multi-Task Learning (MTL) techniques, the results are much more interesting, with classification accuracies over 98%. Integrating node classification as a preliminary step to the PBFT protocol optimizes the consensus.

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that consists of a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each blockchain-based solution deploys a specific consensus algorithm that guarantees the consistency of the ledger over time. The most famous, and yet claimed to be the most secure, is the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. In this paper, we revisit the fundamental calculations and assumptions of this algorithm, originally presented in the Bitcoin white paper. We break down its claimed calculations in order to better understand the underlying assumptions of the proposal. We also propose a novel formalization model of the PoW mining problem using the Birthday paradox. We utilize this model to formalize and analyze partial pre-image attacks on PoW-based blockchains, with formal analysis that confirms the experimental results and the previously proposed implications. We build on those analyses and propose new concepts for benchmarking the security of PoW-based systems, including Critical Difficulty and Critical Difficulty per given portion. Our calculations result in several important findings, including the profitability of launching partial pre-image attacks on PoW-based blockchains, once the mining puzzle difficulty reaches a given threshold. Specifically, for any compromised portion of the network (\n; honest majority assumption still holds), the attack is formally proven profitable once the PoW mining puzzle difficulty reaches 56 leading zeros.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advancements of IoT and blockchain, a novel era has emerged in the domain of smart building systems. At the same time, it also brings some problems and challenges. Most traditional solutions typically utilize the fully-replicated storage strategy that results in high storage costs, while recent solutions like coded blockchain may compromise query efficiency. Moreover, traditional reputation-based consensus schemes do not consider dynamic situations, limiting scalability. To handle these problems, we propose a novel hierarchical message aggregation scheme and a classified storage method under ReedâSolomon (RS) coding to minimize storage overhead while ensuring data recoverability and query performance. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic incentive reputation consensus mechanism to tackle scalability challenges such as preventing node monopolies, promoting new node integration, and enhancing fault tolerance. Through theoretical analysis and experimental simulation, the proposed scheme demonstrates a high degree of decentralization and scalability. Our scheme achieves a 20% reduction in the Gini coefficient compared to other approaches. Furthermore, our scheme can save\nof storage overhead compared to traditional solutions while maintaining high query performance.",

Existing solutions often suffer from centralized architectures, and exorbitant costs. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose SecureVFL, a decentralized multi-party VFL scheme designed to enhance efficiency and trustworthiness while guaranteeing privacy. SecureVFL uses a permissioned blockchain and introduces a novel consensus algorithm, Proof of Feature Sharing (PoFS), to facilitate decentralized, trustworthy, and high-throughput federated training. SecureVFL introduces a verifiable and lightweight three-party Replicated Secret Sharing (RSS) protocol for feature intersection summation among overlapping users. Furthermore, we propose a\n-sharing protocol to achieve federated training in a four-party VFL setting. This protocol involves only addition operations and exhibits robustness. SecureVFL not only enables anonymous interactions among participants but also safeguards their real identities, and provides mechanisms to unmask these identities when malicious activities are performed. We illustrate the proposed mechanism through a case study on VFL across four banks. Finally, our theoretical analysis proves the security of SecureVFL. Experiments demonstrated that SecureVFL outperformed existing multi-party VFL privacy-preserving schemes, such as MP-FedXGB, in terms of both overhead and model performance.",

It addresses the lack of attention from previous literature on these factors in the context of blockchain adoption, especially amidst the recent blockchain hype. By integrating Task-Technology Fit (TTF) and a modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study employs a questionnaire survey. The results demonstrate that the alignment between blockchain and work characteristics significantly impacts performance expectations and the recognition of opportunities, thereby influencing the intention to adopt blockchain. Furthermore, factors such as effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived policy uncertainty influence adoption intention by identifying opportunities. Exposure to blockchain-related knowledge reinforces the relationships mentioned above. Additionally, digital natives display greater confidence in blockchain's potential to enhance work performance than digital immigrants. These study findings offer valuable insights and strategies for blockchain technology providers and provide a comprehensive survey for individuals and professionals interested in embracing or understanding the dynamics of blockchain adoption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that allows for the immutable and auditable logging of transactions without needing a central authority or centralized database. First introduced in 2008 as the technology behind the digital currency Bitcoin, blockchain has now found use in a wide range of sectors. Modern agriculture supply networks have emerged to accommodate intricate interactions between regional actors and the agricultural environment. Interactions between various participants in the supply chain, including those involved in manufacturing, processing, and delivery. One of the main reasons fraud happens so often in agriculture is the lack of transparency in the supply chain. Businesses that arenât transparent run the risk of losing money, alienating their customers, and seeing their brands decline in value. To encourage the growth of an efficient and trustworthy trading environment, several fundamental adjustments to the current supply chain architecture are necessary. The potential for blockchain technology to enhance food and agricultural supply chain transparency is well acknowledged. Companies utilize IoT and blockchain to create more equitable, sustainable, and customer-friendly food manufacturing systems. In this current work, a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp), âASBlockâ, is developed for agricultural-based supply chain management. The primary focus of this developed application is to bring transparency and security to all participating users of the application; the users of this application include farmers or producers, suppliers or retailers, hotels, and end users. The performance analysis shows that the average gas utilization of the proposed ASBlock dApp is â¼ 2.8 â 104. The average smart contract execution time for all use cases is â¼ 112sec.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the context of the increasingly diversified blockchain technology, interoperability among heterogeneous blockchains has become key to further advancing this field. Existing cross-chain technologies, while facilitating data and asset exchange between different blockchains to some extent, have exposed issues such as insufficient security, low efficiency, and inconsistent standards. Consequently, these issues give rise to significant obstacles in terms of both scalability and seamless communication among blockchains within a multi-chain framework. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient method for cross-chain interaction in a multi-chain environment. Building upon the traditional sidechain model, this method employs smart contracts and hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) to design a cross-chain interaction scheme. This approach decentralizes the execution of locking, verifying, and unlocking stages in cross-chain transactions, effectively avoiding centralization risks associated with third-party entities in the process. It also greatly enhances the efficiency of fund transfers between the main chain and sidechains, while ensuring the security of cross-chain transactions to some extent. Additionally, this paper innovatively proposes a cross-chain data interaction strategy. Through smart contracts on the main chain, data from sidechains can be uploaded, verified, and stored on the main chain, achieving convenient and efficient cross-chain data sharing. The contribution of this paper is the development of a decentralized protocol that coordinates the execution of cross-chain interactions without the need to trust external parties, thereby reducing the risk of centralization and enhancing security. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our solution in increasing transaction security and efficiency, with significant improvements over existing models. Our experiments emphasize the system's ability to handle a variety of transaction scenarios with improved throughput and reduced latency, highlighting the practical applicability and scalability of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain can realize the reliable storage of a large amount of data that is chronologically related and verifiable within the system. This technology has been widely used and has developed rapidly in big data systems across various fields. An increasing number of users are participating in application systems that use blockchain as their underlying architecture. As the number of transactions and the capital involved in blockchain grow, ensuring information security becomes imperative. Addressing the verification of transactional information security and privacy has emerged as a critical challenge. Blockchain-based verification methods can effectively eliminate the need for centralized third-party organizations. However, the efficiency of nodes in storing and verifying blockchain data faces unprecedented challenges. To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient verification scheme for transaction security. Initially, it presents a node evaluation module to estimate the activity level of user nodes participating in transactions, accompanied by a probabilistic analysis for all transactions. Subsequently, this paper optimizes the conventional transaction organization form, introduces a heterogeneous Merkle tree storage structure, and designs algorithms for constructing these heterogeneous trees. Theoretical analyses and simulation experiments conclusively demonstrate the superior performance of this scheme. When verifying the same number of transactions, the heterogeneous Merkle tree transmits less data and is more efficient than traditional methods. The findings indicate that the heterogeneous Merkle tree structure is suitable for various blockchain applications, including the Internet of Things. This scheme can markedly enhance the efficiency of information verification and bolster the security of distributed systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the continuous development of UAV technology, the application of UAV swarm in the military field is gradually becoming the focus of research around the world. Although it can bring a series of benefits in autonomous cooperation, the traditional UAV management technology is prone to hacker attacks due to many security issues such as a single point of failure brought by centralized management. Because of the advantages of distributed, tamper-proof, and traceability, blockchain is applied to UAV swarm to solve some of the security problems caused by centralized management. However, due to the limitations of its consensus algorithm Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), its communication complexity will increase rapidly with the increase of the number of nodes, which also leads to the poor scalability of the algorithm and can only be applied to small-scale networks. To use the PBFT algorithm in large-scale networks such as UAV swarm, a dynamic and highly trusted PBFT (DTPBFT) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new consensus algorithm model including consensus layer and verification layer is designed. Then, a consensus node election scheme based on trust mechanism is proposed under this model. The trust degree of nodes in the blockchain network is comprehensively evaluated by selecting several representative indicators, and the weight factor of each indicator is calculated by entropy weight method. It not only reduces the communication complexity, but also ensures the reliability and dynamic update of consensus nodes. Experiments show that when the number of UAVs is 200, the consensus time of DTPBFT is 0.24 s, which indicates that this algorithm can support large-scale UAV swarm without causing communication congestion, so it has good scalability. In addition, experiments also show that DTPBFT can tolerate more than\nmalicious nodes, which improves the fault tolerance rate of PBFT.",

Therefore, it is crucial for system designers to evaluate the performance and characteristics of a given blockchain platform before deploying it. One way to achieve this is through the use of blockchain simulators. However, existing simulators have limitations in areas such as model scaling, event scheduling, time control, object model evaluation, and simulation magnitude. To address these limitations, we propose a Blockchain Simulator based on Event-Layered Architecture (BSELA) in this paper. BSELA comprises multiple functional modules with effective model scalability, with the core being our proposed Event-Layered Architecture. This architecture introduces a new event-driven scheduling mechanism for discrete-event simulation, which improves the efficiency, stability, and maintainability of event scheduling during blockchain simulation. Furthermore, we propose a time advancement mechanism for subsequent events based on event rounds, which improves the accuracy of time advancement, simulation complexity, and real-time demand handling capability during the simulation. We begin by validating the efficiency of our simulator by comparing experiments with those of existing blockchain simulators. We then validate the accuracy of BSELA through simulation experiments on blockchain network connectivity, block propagation latency, and the number of INV messages propagated per hour. We validated the accuracy of the experimental results by conducting a comparison with Bitcoin data. Finally, in order to address the research gap in the performance of blockchain systems at the underlying peer-to-peer network level and in other fields, we designed and experimentally validated the node-trust network construction mechanism by adjusting the simulatorâs blockchain object model. Our experiments show that this tuning mechanism improves data transfer efficiency by 30%â40%, and also improves security. The design and experiments of the BSELA tuning mechanism validate the scalability and flexibility of our simulator for blockchain research.",

    "abstract": "The Access control scheme is an effective method to protect user data privacy. The access control scheme based on blockchain and ciphertext policy attribute encryption (CPâABE) can solve the problems of singleâpoint of failure and lack of trust in the centralized system. However, it also brings new problems to the health information in the cloud storage environment, such as attribute leakage, low consensus efficiency, complex permission updates, and so on. This paper proposes an access control scheme with fine-grained attribute revocation, keyword search, and traceability of the attribute private key distribution process. Blockchain technology tracks the authorization of attribute private keys. The credit scoring method improves the Raft protocol in consensus efficiency. Besides, the interplanetary file system (IPFS) addresses the capacity deficit of blockchain. Under the premise of hiding policy, the research proposes a fine-grained access control method based on users, user attributes, and file structure. It optimizes the data-sharing mode. At the same time, Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) technology is used to update the access rights. The proposed scheme proved to be secure. Comparative analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme has higher efficiency and more functions. It can meet the needs of medical institutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the wide application of the Internet of Things (IoT), storing large amounts of IoT data and protecting data privacy has become a meaningful issue. In general, the access control mechanism is used to prevent illegal users from accessing private data. However, traditional data access control schemes face some non-ignorable problems, such as only supporting coarse-grained access control, the risk of centralization, and high trust issues. In this paper, an attribute-based data access control scheme using blockchain technology is proposed. To address these problems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has become a promising solution for encrypted data access control. Firstly, we utilize blockchain technology to construct a decentralized access control scheme, which can grant data access with transparency and traceability. Furthermore, our scheme also guarantees the privacy of policies and attributes on the blockchain network. Secondly, we optimize an ABE scheme, which makes the size of system parameters smaller and improves the efficiency of algorithms. These optimizations enable our proposed scheme supports large attribute universe requirements in IoT environments. Thirdly, to prohibit attribute impersonation and attribute replay attacks, we design a challenge-response mechanism to verify the ownership of attributes. Finally, we evaluate the security and performance of the scheme. And comparisons with other related schemes show the advantages of our proposed scheme. Compared to existing schemes, our scheme has more comprehensive advantages, such as supporting a large universe, full security, expressive policy, and policy hiding.",

Access control is a mechanism that limits data visibility and ensures that only authorized users can decrypt and access encrypted information, playing a crucial role in addressing privacy concerns and securing the data stored on a blockchain. Redactability and access control are both essential components when implementing a regulated consortium blockchain in real-world situations to ensure the secure sharing of data while removing undesirable content.

Developing countries have witnessed great digital transformation, and one of the key challenges during this development phase has been to create a platform that integrates the health and vitals of citizens confidentially. The healthcare insurance industry is one sector that has experienced a significant number of instances of fraudulent claims and mismanagement of patient data. These issues often arise due to inadequate technological integration and an over-reliance on manual processes and human intervention. The insurance industry relies on multiple processes between end users to initiate, maintain, and close diverse policies. The proposed model initially recommends a suitable insurance policy for newly admitted patients, but in the case of existing patients, the objectives are to speed up transaction processing and payment settlement securely using a private blockchain. Collectively, these two technologies possess the potential to revolutionize the future. This study aims to incorporate blockchain and ML techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Regression, which can differentiate between fraudulent and legal medical records to recommend personalized policies, streamline claim processing, and ensure the security of sensitive patient information and vital insurance records. The key aim is to create a more patient-centric environment with data transparency. This integrated framework results in a secure, adaptable, and efficient ecosystem that outperforms traditional methods, paving the way for the future of healthcare and insurance services.",

This also introduces several challenges for the efficient performance and management of the supply chain system. Whereas restrictive factors such as supplier confidentiality agreements have limited the product encroachment by the suppliers, the adoption of blockchain technology for improving information diaphaneity and efficiency of the supply chain can potentially encourage market intrusion by the suppliers. Therefore, whether blockchain technology can be successfully accepted and implemented by both the suppliers and incumbent manufacturers, and how this can be achieved, are issues that need urgent attention in the case of supply chain systems. In this paper, we establish a two-stage assembly supply chain consisting of an incumbent manufacturer and a core component supplier that invades the downstream market with imitation products, in order to analyze the impact of supplier encroachment and the application of blockchain technology on the assembly system. The results show that it is more beneficial to play the dual role of core supplier and product manufacturer than to only be a core supplier. Similarly, when the cost of implementing blockchain technology is lower than a specific threshold, the implementation of blockchain is always beneficial for the encroaching supplier, whereas the manufacturer does not always benefit. The blockchain not only improves the selling price of the core component produced by the supplier, but also improves the quality of the core component and increases the total market demand. Finally, in view of the potential benefits and conflicts that may arise from the implementation of the blockchain, we design corresponding ex-ante, ex-post and hybrid coordination mechanisms to achieve a winâwin situation in this competitive system. Our modeling work and results provide useful managerial insights regarding the encroachment by core component suppliers and the implementation of blockchain technology in assembly supply chains.",

Using GMM on a sample of firms indexed on Blockchain50 in China during 2009â2022, findings show that Largest-shareholders minimise CH, indicating corporate expansion. Due to their monitoring motive, Top10-shareholders allow corporations to maintain large cash. To prevent currency misuse, institutional ownership and CH are negatively related. Managerial ownership favours, while the chairman ownership lowers CH, supporting the interest alignment theory. Pre- and post-BCT index period analyses demonstrate a weak post-index period influence. The BCT adaptation lessens information asymmetry and aids in reducing agency issues through quick information flow, limiting ownersâ influence. This study adds empirical evidence on ownership structure and CH. The study's findings may apply to developing market enterprises employing BCT's corporate governance structures.",

This paper presents a novel approach to addressing these problems using blockchain technology. More specifically, data from the Italian Regusto platform are analysed to identify factors that determine the volume and economic value of surplus food redistribution.\nFrom a methodological statistical perspective, the performance of Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest are compared in a blockchain data analysis. The effective machine-learning-based analysis reveals that the Regusto platform gives people greater access to the surplus food redistributed by non-profit organizations and suppliers through both donations and sales. The study also highlights the potential effects of redistributing surplus food on the beneficiaries' diets and health and we find that redistributing surplus food can reduce household food insecurity among low-income families and communities measured by food poverty and COVID-19 indexes at different spatial locations.\nOverall, by offering a unique perspective on these issues through the lens of blockchain technology, our study can inspire further research on how this technology can ensure everyone has enough affordable, nutritious food to lead healthy lives.",

    "abstract": "Cloud storage is widely used by large companies to store vast amounts of data and files, offering flexibility, financial savings, and security. However, information shoplifting poses significant threats, potentially leading to poor performance and privacy breaches. Blockchain-based cognitive computing can help protect and maintain information security and privacy in cloud platforms, ensuring businesses can focus on business development. To ensure data security in cloud platforms, this research proposed a blockchain-based Hybridized Data Driven Cognitive Computing (HD2C) model. However, the proposed HD2C framework addresses breaches of the privacy information of mixed participants of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the cloud. HD2C is developed by combining Federated Learning (FL) with a Blockchain consensus algorithm to connect smart contracts with Proof of Authority. The âData Islandâ problem can be solved by FLâs emphasis on privacy and lightning-fast processing, while Blockchain provides a decentralized incentive structure that is impervious to poisoning. FL with Blockchain allows quick consensus through smart member selection and verification. The HD2C paradigm significantly improves the computational processing efficiency of intelligent manufacturing. Extensive analysis results derived from IIoT datasets confirm HD2C superiority. When compared to other consensus algorithms, the Blockchain PoAâs foundational cost is significant. The accuracy and memory utilization evaluation results predict the total benefits of the system. In comparison to the É³ values 0.004 and 0.04, the É³ value of 0.4 achieves good accuracy. According to the experiment results, the number of transactions per second has minimal impact on memory requirements. The findings of this study resulted in the development of a brand-new IIoT framework based on blockchain technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nConsidering the privacy challenges of secure storage and controlled flow, there is an urgent need to realize a decentralized ecosystem of private blockchain for cyberspace. A collaboration dilemma arises when the participants are self-interested and lack feedback of complete information. Traditional blockchains have similar faults, such as trustlessness, single-factor consensus, and heavily distributed ledger, preventing them from adapting to the heterogeneous and resource-constrained Internet of Things. In this paper, we develop the game-theoretic design of a two-sided rating with complete information feedback to stimulate collaborations for private blockchain. The design consists of an evolution strategy of the decision-making network and a computing power network for continuously verifiable proofs. We formulate the optimum rating and resource scheduling problems as two-stage iterative games between participants and leaders. We theoretically prove that the Stackelberg equilibrium exists and the group evolution is stable. Then, we propose a multi-stage evolution consensus with feedback on a block-accounting workload for metadata survival. To continuously validate a block, the metadata of the optimum rating, privacy, and proofs are extracted to store on a lightweight blockchain. Moreover, to increase resource utilization, surplus computing power is scheduled flexibly to enhance security by degrees. Finally, the evaluation results show the validity and efficiency of our model, thereby solving the collaboration dilemma in the private blockchain.",

    "abstract": "With its untameable and traceable properties, blockchain technology has been widely used in the field of data sharing. How to preserve individual privacy while enabling efficient data queries is one of the primary issues with secure data sharing. In this paper, we study verifiable keyword frequency (KF) queries with local differential privacy in blockchain. Both the numerical and the keyword attributes are present in data objects; the latter are sensitive and require privacy protection. However, prior studies in blockchain have the problem of trilemma in privacy protection and are unable to handle KF queries. We propose an efficient framework that protects data ownersâ privacy on keyword attributes while enabling quick and verifiable query processing for KF queries. The framework computes an estimate of a keywordâs frequency and is efficient in query time and verification object (VO) size. A utility-optimized local differential privacy technique is used for privacy protection. The data owner adds noise locally into data based on local differential privacy so that the attacker cannot infer the owner of the keywords while keeping the difference in the probability distribution of the KF within the privacy budget. We propose the VB-cm tree as the authenticated data structure (ADS). The VB-cm tree combines the Verkle tree and the Count-Min sketch (CM-sketch) to lower the VO size and query time. The VB-cm tree uses the vector commitment to verify the query results. The fixed-size CM-sketch, which summarizes the frequency of multiple keywords, is used to estimate the KF via hashing operations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed framework. The experimental results show that compared to the Merkle B+ tree, the query time is reduced by 52.38%, and the VO size is reduced by more than one order of magnitude.",

Timely and accurate information exchange is crucial for assessing factors such as carbon emissions and consumer demand. This paper explores the impact of digital and carbon reduction technologies on supply chain decisions, incorporating fuzzy logic and blockchain technology for enhanced decision-making. We specifically focus on a single buyer ordering from a vendor, where faulty items are promptly returned upon inspection. The lead time for the initial delivery includes both production and non-productive time, while successive deliveries only entail transportation time. The research employs intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers to represent all carbon factors and integrates blockchain technology to improve demand forecasting. The purpose is to determine the optimal strategies to minimize the carbon and joint total cost of the system. A solution methodology has been proposed for determining optimal strategies, illustrated through a numerical example. The optimal decisions are compared, both with and without blockchain, to validate the proposed model. The findings suggest that blockchain has a substantial impact on both optimal decision-making and the results of carbon reduction efforts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a blockchain-based supply chain is both time- and cost-efficient, reduces costs and errors in data information, and efficiently shortens lead time in the network.",

    "abstract": "In the information age, electronic documents (e-documents) have become a popular alternative to paper documents due to their lower costs, higher dissemination rates, and ease of knowledge sharing. However, digital copyright infringements occur frequently due to the ease of copying, which not only infringes on the rights of creators but also weakens their creative enthusiasm. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an e-document sharing system that enforces copyright protection. However, the existing centralized system has outstanding vulnerabilities, and the plagiarism detection algorithm used cannot fully detect the context, semantics, style, and other factors of the text. Digital watermark technology is only used as a means of infringement tracing. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for e-document sharing based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) in blockchain. The use of blockchain as a distributed credit base resolves the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. The e-document evaluation and plagiarism detection mechanisms based on the DAO model effectively address challenges in comprehensive text information checks, thereby promoting the enhancement of e-document quality. The mechanism for protecting and circulating e-document copyrights using NFT technology ensures effective safeguarding of usersâ e-document copyrights and facilitates e-document sharing. Moreover, recognizing the security issues within the DAO governance mechanism, we introduce an innovative optimization solution. Through experimentation, we validate the enhanced security of the optimized governance mechanism, reducing manipulation risks by up to 51%. Additionally, by utilizing evolutionary game analysis to deduce the equilibrium strategies of the framework, we discovered that adjusting the reward and penalty parameters of the incentive mechanism motivates creators to generate superior quality and unique e-documents, while evaluators are more likely to engage in assessments.",

In almost all fields, this technology has seduced the actors because of its potentialities, namely traceability, transparency, security, immutability, etc. However, setting up such a technology adapted to one's needs is far from being a classic project. Indeed, a technical and organizational decision support is very important during a blockchain project to measure its actions and anticipate the risks. In this paper, we will focus on the choice of the public or private blockchain according to technical, functional criteria, and a decision aid module based on the Fuzzy method is proposed to do so. The results obtained prove the effectiveness of our approach used in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRural fishing communities face numerous challenges related to livelihood security, as they are engaged in a risky and labour-intensive occupation. They often receive only a small portion of the profits, due to the influence of self-serving local intermediaries, lack of transparency in the business processes, trust issues, and power differentials among stakeholders. Although still in its infancy, blockchain technology has been adopted in various urban settings to mitigate similar challenges and to build trust through its security attributes, data ledger transparency, and smart contract automation. Yet, few have explored the efficacy of blockchain technology in addressing the unique challenges faced by rural fishermen in marketing their catch and connecting them to a broader range of customers for improved livelihood resilience. This study aims to examine how the livelihood resilience of fishermen can be increased through the potential of a blockchain, in a fishing community in the coastal village of Alappad in Kerala, India. Thematic analysis of data acquired from 43 semi-structured qualitative interviews and participatory rural appraisal tools revealed five categories of challenges: business cost and profitability, government regulations, low education and digital illiteracy, socio-cultural limitations, and over-dependence on middlemen as inhibitors to fishermen's livelihoods. The study proposes a blockchain-based e-commerce framework to mitigate selected challenges that emerged due to a lack of trust and transparency in the local fish market. It contributes to rural development by exploring an innovative, solution aligned with five UN Sustainable Development Goals, in contrast to the Business-as-usual approach in offering technological solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research aims to develop and optimize an intelligent supply chain framework tailored for the insurance industry by integrating an innovative inventory management policy supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies. Through an extensive literature review, key assumptions are established, needs are identified, and objectives are formulated. A multi-objective mathematical planning model is proposed to minimize cost and time within the supply chain, with optimization conducted under deterministic and fuzzy conditions. The model utilizes augmented epsilon constraint and weighted sum methods to address its multi-objectiveness. Noteworthy is the integration of advanced technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), blockchain, and online sales, distinguishing it from traditional approaches. Initial validation and testing in smaller dimensions demonstrate the modelâs adaptability to precise methods, while larger dimensions necessitate the use of meta-heuristic algorithms for efficient problem resolution. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis in the insurance industry on objective function coefficients reveals intricate relationships, offering valuable insights into optimization dynamics across diverse conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDigital globalization enabled by disruptive technologies has opened a myriad of ways to create value, warranting a cross-disciplinary research agenda on digital connectivity in international business (IB). Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWEEE recycling not only effectively reduces environmental pollution and resource waste, but also creates economic benefits, which is in line with the concept of green development. However, the recycling market for used and end-of-life electrical products is characterized by problems such as asymmetric information and easy manipulation or loss of data, which may bring losses to enterprises. In this paper, by constructing a game model of the government, producers, and third-party recyclers, We delve into the optimal strategies of individual entities within the supply chain, contemplating both scenarios: the incorporation of blockchain technology and its absence, to determine the most logical and effective approach for each. The results show that the optimal strategies of the supply chain actors change in the case of adopting blockchain technology. At the same time, the profitability of each entity within the supply chain is predominantly influenced by the rate of inventory availability, information loss rate and input technology cost, and each subject can choose whether to put into use blockchain technology according to the actual situation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFood safety hazards can be discovered and avoided using XAI and blockchain technology. The immutable and transparent ledger of blockchain technology can be used to maintain track of perishable food items, allowing for more rapid and precise detection of contamination and immediate removal from shelves. Using blockchain technology, smart agriculture can streamline the supply chain by connecting farmers directly with their customers. As a result, community members may be more confident in meeting their own dietary needs. Combining XAI, blockchain, and smart agriculture has far-reaching societal and economic implications. More efficiency, openness, and sustainability in the food chain might benefit farmers, consumers, and the world. This study provides a detailed bibliometric overview and visualization of integrating two prominent and promising technologies, explainable AI and Blockchain, into Smart Agriculture. In this study, the author implemented analysis in four phases, and for each phase, the author chose different strings, which provided different analysis results. 2479 articles are taken for âsmart agricultureâ, 103 articles for âSmart agriculture and blockchainâ, 37 articles for âblockchain and explainable,â and finally, seven articles for âsmart agriculture and explainable AIâ. In this study, the mapping program VOSviewer is used for Network analysis. This study uses the co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling employed in VOSviewer to uncover significant focus areas and prominent authors and publications. By using a variety of publications, research was conducted on vital topics for this integration; as a consequence, influence and collaborations began to take place, ultimately leading to development.",

These include different types of disclosure (i.e., product, process, and sourcing network), self- and third-party verified disclosure, partial and full disclosure, as well as the attributes associated with information disclosure using blockchain technology: immutability and update frequency. Building on concepts in signalling theory and inter-organisational trust, our research uses a choice-based conjoint experimental design to elicit responses from 234 managers with decision-making roles in procurement. Using this design, we calculate the relative importance of attributes, part-worth utility, and marginal willingness to pay, and test hypotheses about buyer preferences and willingness to pay. Our research reveals that buyers prefer suppliers with sustainability signals that span across different types of disclosure and methods of disclosure. It emphasises the importance of how sustainability information is disclosed, highlighting buyer trust in self-disclosure and a preference for comprehensive, regularly updated information. However, we find mixed results for buyers' willingness to pay. For instance, buyers prefer third-party verified supply chain transparency, but we do not find a significantly higher willingness to pay for such information compared to self-disclosure. The implications suggest a competitive advantage for suppliers adopting voluntary disclosure, prioritising disclosure based on buyer preferences, and recognising the limited direct impact of blockchain technology. Our research contributes to advancing our understanding of information disclosure in supply chain transparency and presents new avenues of inquiry into the value of blockchain-enabled platforms in supply chain sustainability reporting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores how digital entrepreneurs' intention toward blockchain technology adoption, perception of reduced costs, and knowledge of Artificial Intelligence impact achieving UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing attention from various sectors. Present study applies explanatory sequential mixed method for data collection. Moreover, to work with the dual face patterned data, PLS-SEM is used to perform quantitative analysis of the data collected from 389 digital entrepreneurs who are chosen through purposive sampling and then content analysis is performed for the qualitative data according to the explanatory sequential mixed method's rule of thumb. The study's quantitative phase shows that factors such as perceived ease of use and usefulness of Industry 4.0 technologies, knowledge of artificial intelligence (KAI), and perception of reduced cost positively influence digital entrepreneurs' intention to adopt blockchain technology (BCT). Notably, KAI has the strongest impact. In the qualitative phase, it's found that digital entrepreneurs' KAI and willingness to adopt BCT strongly align with achieving several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), suggesting BCT adoption's potential for sustainable outcomes. The outcomes of this study set a new benchmark in the domain of SDGs achievement with careful integration to Industry 4.0, AI and BCT. This study results undoubtedly instigate the digital entrepreneurs to adopt BCT in doing their start-up and convince the policymakers to set regulatory landscape with convenient environment for the utilization of BCT which then ultimately accelerates the achievement of SDGs.",

As observed in recent times, citizens can now apply to open their own commercial file or obtain a passport without having to visit the country's economic institution or the Immigration and Passports headquarters. Additionally, applying or opening accounts in virtual banks also added a lot of services and facilities for users and transactions between countries that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal effort [2]. All these transactions require the user's authentication and identity verification to avoid any personal fraud and save the user's rights\nBlockchain technology stands out as one of the most secure technologies available enabling secure transactions without the need for a central authority. Starting in 2009 1, with Bitcoin leveraging blockchain technology, there has been an increasing number of blockchain technology-based solutions. The significance of this work compared to its predecessors is that it uses an existing product and technology to prove the solutions offered by Blockchain and find a solution for authorization and authentication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has grown enormously in diverse, intelligent applications with high security, transparency, and trust, but performance analysis is still a concern. Various debugging and analysis tools exist that can be used to eliminate bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts. However, these tools are only a little capable of making the solution attack-resistant. This research improves the performance analysis smart contract in the Remix IDE platform. The analysis detects and debugs security and vulnerability issues and minimizes the gas and economy from various smart contract fragments, especially in the Solidity language. This research reduced the number of vulnerabilities to 82 compared to 641 in previous work. The gas fee consumption and code size were also considerably reduced by tens of thousands of Wei, thus improving the performance. The gas fee is reduced by removing unnecessary events, using bytes instead of a string, using the required function, packing the structure tightly, activating the optimizer, using short circuit rules, and using an external function. Also, the code size is reduced using inheritance, modifiers, and removing extra comments. To use inheritance and virtual concepts, the work is deployed on the latest compiler version, i.e., 0.8.17+ commit. The solidity static analysis helped remove vulnerabilities such as similar variable names, use of constructor(), etc. The paper presents a novel approach for researchers to write efficient smart contracts and make an optimized system. The developed system was finally tested on the Goerli test network of Ethereum using Remix IDE, and the results proved the efficiency of the smart contract.",

One of the sectors that can benefit from this technology is the online betting industry. According to Statista, the total value of transactions carried out in this industry will be 92.9 billion dollars in 2023. Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions.\nThis âtechnologyâ allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions.\nFurthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity.\nIn the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the most promising programs for disease prevention and treatment. Meanwhile, the quality of TCM has garnered much attention. To ensure the quality of TCM, many works are based on the blockchain scheme to design the traceability scheme of TCM to trace its origin. Although these schemes can ensure the integrity, sharability, credibility, and immutability of TCM more effectively, many problems are exposed with the rapid growth of TCM data in blockchains, such as expensive overhead, performance bottlenecks, and the traditional blockchain architecture is unsuitable for TCM data with dynamic growth. Motivated by the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel and lightweight TCM traceability architecture based on the blockchain using sharding (LBS-TCM). Compared to the existing blockchain-based TCM traceability system, our architecture utilizes sharding to develop a novel traceability mechanism that supports more convenient traceability operations for TCM requirements such as uploading, querying, and downloading. Specifically, our architecture consists of a leader shard blockchain layer as its main component, which employs a sharding mechanism to conveniently TCM tracing. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that our architecture showed better performance in many aspects compared to traditional blockchain architectures, such as TCM transaction processing, TCM transaction querying, TCM uploading, etc. In our architecture, tracing TCM has become a very efficient operation, which ensures the quality of TCM and provides great convenience for subsequent TCM analysis and retrospective research.",

Nevertheless, in practice, the data distributions among these organizations are often non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which poses significant challenges for traditional federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we present a hierarchical federated learning framework based on blockchain technology, which is designed to enhance the training of non-IID data., protect data privacy and security, and improve federated learning performance. The framework builds a global shared pool by constructing a blockchain system to reduce the non-IID degree of local data and improve model accuracy. In addition, we use smart contracts to distribute and collect models and design a main blockchain to store local models for federated aggregation, achieving decentralized federated learning. We train the MLP model on the MNIST dataset and the CNN model on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the accuracy of decentralized federated learning on three tasks with non-IID data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAn emerging threat within blockchain systems is the malicious tactic known as eclipse attacks, wherein attackers aim to deceive and gain control over targeted nodes. Despite the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, effective defence mechanisms against eclipse attacks have been lacking. A novel and dynamic defence model designed explicitly for Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus blockchain systems is proposed to address this critical issue. The model relies on a node-to-node evaluation mechanism to ensure robust protection. By leveraging mutual evaluations conducted between clients and incorporating the renowned Kademlia algorithm, a ranking value is assigned to each node within the defence model. These rankings empower nodes to prudently select trustworthy peers as neighbours based on a threshold comparison, effectively mitigating the risk posed by malicious nodes. Notably, the proposed approach significantly enhances the security of blockchain systems without necessitating modifications to existing protocols or network structures. The effectiveness of the proposed defence model in countering eclipse attacks is extensively validated through a series of experiments. Furthermore, the approach surpasses previous defence strategies, offering a higher probability of successful defence while maintaining minimal overhead. With its straightforward implementation and operational efficiency, the dynamic defence model is an ideal solution for real-world deployment scenarios. This research presents a compelling and robust defence model against eclipse attacks in PoW blockchain systems, addressing the existing gap in defence mechanisms. Furthermore, this advancement paves the way for the wider adoption of blockchain applications across various domains by providing enhanced security, reliability, and trustworthiness.",

Malicious parties gaining access, and otherwise tampering with election results, or the votes make this effort counterproductive. To alleviate this, this study examined the introduction of blockchain. The transparent and immutable nature of the blockchain makes this data impossible to alter and allows the election results to be transparent. To further increase the transparency of the system while keeping voters anonymous, a biometric based cryptography was introduced. The biometric was introduced as the source for the private key for each voter while a public was generated to act as the identity of the voter. The biometric trait of each individual is unique and cannot be forged, hence the identity of the voter is secured. The public key available cannot be traced by to the private key, hence, identity of the voter is anonymous. The system showed an encouraging performance after testing.",

However, integrating various advancements, such as coordination, adaptivity, and automated responses, within the framework of blockchain-based IoMT has amplified its susceptibility to a range of attacks and vulnerabilities. Assessing and enhancing the resilience of blockchain-based IoMT is of utmost importance, particularly in anticipation of potential disruptions, to ensure its continuous and sustainable functionality. The stochastic nature of risks adds complexity to evaluating the resilience of blockchain-based IoMT, given that resilience in this domain may fluctuate over time. This study employs a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) method to address the evolving characteristics of pertinent variables, capturing their temporal dependencies and demonstrating how the resilience capabilities of blockchain-based IoMT may evolve across different time intervals. Additionally, an information theory approach is adopted to mitigate uncertainty regarding the resilience performance of blockchain-based IoMT and its crucial subcomponents. This research showcases the effectiveness and adaptability of the DBN methodology in healthcare systems, offering insights for shaping appropriate and essential strategies for decision-makers to establish a highly resilient framework for blockchain-based IoMT.",

However, it faces limitations such as scalability issues, high energy consumption, slow transaction validation, expanding storage requirements. Understanding these limitations is crucial for evaluating blockchain's suitability for specific use cases and finding solutions to overcome these challenges. Recognizing these limitations is imperative for assessing blockchain's applicability and devising solutions. This paper introduces a hybrid mechanism, ShardedScale, designed to enhance scalability, throughput, and system performance while mitigating time, gas, and ether consumption. The proposed ShardedScale approach combines various techniques including Proof of Work (PoW), Dynamic On-demand Proof of Stake (DPOS), Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), and sharding. ShardedScale achieved a remarkable 40% reduction in transaction confirmation times, a substantial 60% improvement in throughput, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness with a 30% reduction in gas price consumption and a 25% decrease in ethers consumption. These findings signify a significant step towards addressing challenges faced by traditional blockchain systems, providing valuable insights for future designs in blockchain technology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology can be employed in the education sector by building a decentralized system to store and share student records. The records can be encrypted to guarantee their confidentiality and security. With a blockchain-based system, student records can be saved in blocks that are linked and secured via cryptography. The records are decentralized and not controlled by any single entity, making them less susceptible to hacking or tampering. By using blockchain technology, educational institutions can create a more secure and efficient system for storing and sharing student records. This can streamline the process of transferring records between schools, and provide a secure and transparent way for students to access their own records. In this study, we provide a novel Merkle tree-based strategy for preserving the accuracy of student records and outline how to put it into practice. The software architecture resembled blockchain technology and was developed for private network deployment. The key components of our strategy are replacing conventional audit trails with their cryptographically secure equivalent and simplifying the Blockchain framework by avoiding mining. The cryptography system's framework is presented, and the new five dimensions of chaotic map academic records are proposed. Our study utilizes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences and operations and the chaotic system to strengthen the cryptosystem in the blockchain authentication and authorization process. The significant advantage of this method is enhancing the generation of the hash function, which is the most critical challenge in the blockchain concept. The experimental outcomes and security analysis demonstrated that the proposed method works well in terms of different aspects. The suggested hash function's hash value distribution, sensitivity to tiny message modifications, confusion and diffusion qualities, resilience against birthday attacks, keyspace analysis, collision resistance, efficiency, and flexibility were all considered throughout the study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRisk and uncertainty are crucial factors in decision-making processes, especially when integrating emerging technologies into essential systems like supply chains. Failing to adequately consider significant risks can disrupt supply chain operations, leading to a loss of competitive edge and causing financial and reputational damage. On the other hand, the complex nature of new technology environments, differing viewpoints among stakeholders, and the challenges of interpreting data introduce a variety of uncertainties in decision-making. In this study, we conduct a thorough examination of how blockchain strategies can be applied within supply chain frameworks. Our analysis utilizes data-driven network decision-making models that are refined to effectively manage uncertainty and risk. These models take into account aspects such as supply chain dynamics and technological factors. Importantly, we meld risk considerations with our models to tackle efficiency shortfalls, while also accounting for uncertainty caused by ambiguous and stochastic data environments. By applying and assessing these models in a real-world case study of the oil and gas industry, our research uncovers insightful observations. Specifically, we find that adopting a localization strategy presents specific risks, while a single-use strategy yields significant efficiency improvements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhen applying blockchain sharding technology in the building Internet of Things (IoT) domain to enhance the throughput performance of the blockchain, cross-shard transactions triggered by device collaborative tasks have increasingly become a prominent issue. Existing solutions base their shard division on historical transaction moments, using the outcomes for future transaction processing. However, since the historical interaction characteristics do not accurately reflect the interaction details within specific fine-grained time periods, this leads to poor system performance. Additionally, the parameter configuration in blockchain sharding systems is mostly based on arbitrary or default settings, which also results in unstable system performance. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain sharding scheme called AI-Shard. Firstly, the system includes a module, G-AI, that utilizes generative AI to predict future node interaction relationships, enabling more proactive and adaptive shard division based on the predicted interaction matrix. Secondly, the system integrates a reinforcement learning module, DL-AI, specifically tailored for configuring parameters of the blockchain sharding system, such as the number of shards, block size, and block interval, to automatically optimize them, aiming to further enhance the system's throughput. Experimental results show that AI-Shard can reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and improve the system's throughput.",

This paper presents an approach that utilizes blockchain technology to enhance the security of MQTT communication while maintaining efficiency. This approach involves using blockchain sharding, which enables higher scalability, improved performance, and reduced computational overhead compared to traditional blockchain approaches, making it well-suited for resource-constrained IoT environments. This approach leverages Ethereum blockchain's smart contract mechanism to ensure trust, accountability, and user privacy. Specifically, we introduce a shard-based consensus mechanism that enables improved security while minimizing computational overhead. We also provide a user-controlled and secured algorithm using Proof-of-Access implementation to decentralize user access control to data stored in the blockchain network. The proposed approach is analyzed for usability, including metrics such as bandwidth consumption, CPU usage, memory usage, delay, access time, storage time, and jitter, which are essential for IoT application requirements. The analysis demonstrated that the approach reduces resource consumption, and the proposed system outperforms TLS and existing blockchain approaches in these metrics, regardless of the choice of the MQTT broker. Additionally, thoroughly addressing future research directions, including issues and challenges, ensures careful consideration of potential advancements in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBeef has an important role in the health of the body. Food safety and halal are the main factors for consumers in purchasing beef. However, in reality, several activities in the beef supply chain result in status changes to be unsafe and not halal for consumption. This occurs due to weak food safety and halal supervision in the beef supply chain system. Therefore, this study proposes the use of blockchain technology to strengthen the food safety and halal supervision system in the beef supply chain. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify food safety and halal risk factors, and (2) to develop a blockchain technology design for mitigating food safety and halal risks in the beef supply chain. This research uses the FMEA method to measure risks and FTA for risk analysis. The results showed that 30 risks were identified in the beef supply chain. The highest risk is the absence of a halal certificate on the product. The 30 risks are grouped into 4 risks that are included in extreme priority risk, 11 risks in high priority risk, 4 risks in moderate risk, and 11 risks as acceptable risk. Based on these results, the role of blockchain technology to minimize risk is in the flow of data, and transactions will be easier to track, more transparent, and safer to use as part of the control and supervision system for food safety and halal standards in the beef supply chain. This research has implications for transparency in the supply chain, the accuracy of product track records, prevention of food poisoning, improving halal compliance, risk management and thus increasing consumer confidence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCyber-attacks pose a significant challenge to the security of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, necessitating the development of robust countermeasures tailored to their unique characteristics and limitations. Various prevention and detection techniques have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this paper, we propose an integrated security framework using blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) to protect IoT sensor networks. The framework consists of two modules: a blockchain prevention module and an ML detection module. The blockchain prevention module has two lightweight mechanisms: identity management and trust management. Identity management employs a lightweight Smart Contract (SC) to manage node registration and authentication, ensuring that unauthorized entities are prohibited from engaging in any tasks, while trust management uses a lightweight SC that is responsible for maintaining trust and credibility between sensor nodes throughout the network's lifetime and tracking historical node behaviors. Consensus and transaction validation are achieved through a Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (VBFT) mechanism to ensure network reliability and integrity. The ML detection module utilizes the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm to classify malicious nodes and notify the blockchain network if it must make decisions to mitigate their impacts. We investigate the performance of several off-the-shelf ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Complement Naive Bayes, Nearest Centroid, and Stacking, using the WSN-DS dataset. LightGBM is selected following a detailed comparative analysis conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, processing time, training time, prediction time, computational complexity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) evaluation metrics.",

Using multivariate regression analysis, we find that blockchain fees in USD increase with network congestion, measured by the mempool count, in a non-linear manner as hypothesized by Huberman et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSeveral studies were conducted to demonstrate the application of Process Mining (PM) techniques to Ethereum-compatible application event data. However, the availability of event data is constrained by the applicationâs process awareness, which is under-reported in the literature. Based on domain analysis, which identified several challenges to mining the business process from blockchain applications, a framework was designed, instantiated, and tested in this study. The framework supports identification of appropriate cases for PM and automates the generation of event logs from blockchain data. It consists of two modules, the Process Awareness Recognizer (PAR) and the Event Log Generator (ELG). PAR is a rule-based classifier to assess the process awareness of a given application. ELG is an automated batch processing model consisting of three methods: (1) Extractor: to retrieve event data from blockchains; (2) Decoder: to transform the extracted data to a human-readable format; and (3) Formatter: to produce event log files in a format compatible with PM tools. It was validated by implementing a proof-of-concept application with an input set of 201 real-world applications. The results prove the frameworkâs feasibility and applicability.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (193KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDrawing from the literature on decentralized finance (DeFi) and third-level digital (in)equality as well as from the emerging literature on artificial intelligence (AI), this study examined differences between investors and non-investors of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Data from a cross-sectional survey among users of AI technologies (N = 502) indicate that investors of blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs show higher blockchain transparency perception, greater trust in cryptocurrencies, and higher perceived asset value of NFTs than non-investors. Results also indicate that investors show greater technopian views on AI, higher AI awareness, and higher third-level AI equality than non-investors. Furthermore, the mediation effect of trust in cryptocurrencies on the relationship between investment status and perceived asset value of NFTs and the moderation effect of AI awareness on the relationship between investment status and third-level AI equality were revealed. Differential psychographics of investors versus non-investors were also found such that investors feel lonelier, experience higher existential isolation, and indicate higher need to belong than non-investors. Unique theoretical contributions to the literature on the intersection of DeFi and third-level digital (in)equality in light of AI-driven digital transformation as well as managerial implications for the emerging NFT FinTech marketplace are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The consensus scheme is an essential component in the real blockchain environment. The Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a competitive consensus scheme that can decrease energy costs, promote decentralization, and increase efficiency, respectively. However, how to study the knowledge representation of the collective voting information and then select delegates is a new open problem. To ensure the fairness and effectiveness of transactions in the blockchain, in this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained knowledge representation method, which improves the DPoS scheme based on the linguistic term set (LTS) and proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (PHFLTS). To this end, the symmetrical LTS is used in this study to express the fine-grained voting options that can be chosen to evaluate the blockchain nodes. PHFLTS is used to model the collective voting information on the voted blockchain nodes by aggregating the voting information from other blockchain nodes. To rank the blockchain nodes and then choose the delegate, a novel delegate selection algorithm is proposed based on the cumulative possibility degree. Finally, the numerical examples are used to demonstrate the implementation process of the proposed DPoS consensus algorithm and also its rationality. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed DPoS consensus algorithm is verified. The results show that the proposed DPoS consensus algorithm shows better performance than the existing DPoS consensus algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIdentity sharing systems, regardless of their architectural models, share common vulnerabilities. These systems compel users to divulge personal information and furnish proof of identity for accessing services, leaving them susceptible to data breaches that can culminate in identity theft and jeopardize online data security. While blockchain technology offers a potential remedy, delivering enhanced security, immutability, and traceability, it simultaneously raises pertinent concerns surrounding privacy and transparency. The integration of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology has emerged as a promising solution, particularly in enhancing privacy within the transparent blockchain ecosystem. Our paper conducts an exhaustive survey of the existing literature, with a particular focus on the assimilation of ZKP technology into blockchain for the secure sharing of user identities. We undertake a critical evaluation of the advancements achieved in this domain, pinpoint the formidable challenges that must be confronted, and uncover nascent opportunities for further exploration. Our contribution transcends the realms of mere summarization and analysis; we go a step further by offering recommendations drawn from real-world case studies and delineating future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSeveral studies were conducted to demonstrate the application of Process Mining (PM) techniques to Ethereum-compatible application event data. However, the availability of event data is constrained by the applicationâs process awareness, which is under-reported in the literature. Based on domain analysis, which identified several challenges to mining the business process from blockchain applications, a framework was designed, instantiated, and tested in this study. The framework supports identification of appropriate cases for PM and automates the generation of event logs from blockchain data. It consists of two modules, the Process Awareness Recognizer (PAR) and the Event Log Generator (ELG). PAR is a rule-based classifier to assess the process awareness of a given application. ELG is an automated batch processing model consisting of three methods: (1) Extractor: to retrieve event data from blockchains; (2) Decoder: to transform the extracted data to a human-readable format; and (3) Formatter: to produce event log files in a format compatible with PM tools. It was validated by implementing a proof-of-concept application with an input set of 201 real-world applications. The results prove the frameworkâs feasibility and applicability.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (193KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBeef has an important role in the health of the body. Food safety and halal are the main factors for consumers in purchasing beef. However, in reality, several activities in the beef supply chain result in status changes to be unsafe and not halal for consumption. This occurs due to weak food safety and halal supervision in the beef supply chain system. Therefore, this study proposes the use of blockchain technology to strengthen the food safety and halal supervision system in the beef supply chain. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify food safety and halal risk factors, and (2) to develop a blockchain technology design for mitigating food safety and halal risks in the beef supply chain. This research uses the FMEA method to measure risks and FTA for risk analysis. The results showed that 30 risks were identified in the beef supply chain. The highest risk is the absence of a halal certificate on the product. The 30 risks are grouped into 4 risks that are included in extreme priority risk, 11 risks in high priority risk, 4 risks in moderate risk, and 11 risks as acceptable risk. Based on these results, the role of blockchain technology to minimize risk is in the flow of data, and transactions will be easier to track, more transparent, and safer to use as part of the control and supervision system for food safety and halal standards in the beef supply chain. This research has implications for transparency in the supply chain, the accuracy of product track records, prevention of food poisoning, improving halal compliance, risk management and thus increasing consumer confidence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCyber-attacks pose a significant challenge to the security of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, necessitating the development of robust countermeasures tailored to their unique characteristics and limitations. Various prevention and detection techniques have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this paper, we propose an integrated security framework using blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) to protect IoT sensor networks. The framework consists of two modules: a blockchain prevention module and an ML detection module. The blockchain prevention module has two lightweight mechanisms: identity management and trust management. Identity management employs a lightweight Smart Contract (SC) to manage node registration and authentication, ensuring that unauthorized entities are prohibited from engaging in any tasks, while trust management uses a lightweight SC that is responsible for maintaining trust and credibility between sensor nodes throughout the network's lifetime and tracking historical node behaviors. Consensus and transaction validation are achieved through a Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (VBFT) mechanism to ensure network reliability and integrity. The ML detection module utilizes the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm to classify malicious nodes and notify the blockchain network if it must make decisions to mitigate their impacts. We investigate the performance of several off-the-shelf ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Complement Naive Bayes, Nearest Centroid, and Stacking, using the WSN-DS dataset. LightGBM is selected following a detailed comparative analysis conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, processing time, training time, prediction time, computational complexity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) evaluation metrics.",

First, we provide a framework to establish the supply chain (SC) theory within the linchpins of the nine waves of sustainability theory. Second, we provide a real-world example of how blockchain operates to support the premise that hacking a blockchain requires very large capacities of computing power. We also demonstrate a method of detecting the possibility of hacking individual nodes that supply information to the blockchain. Third, we utilize the blockchain and gather thousands of data points and prove statistically that the tokenization of the oil and gas industry will increase market liquidity, market volume, profitability, and sustainability while reducing transaction time. The robotic blockchain is investigated as a mechanism for improving the efficiency of natural gas SC resource use through fuzzy modular function hashing and salting algorithms and entropy density.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn times of rapid and unpredictable developments, companies experience significant volatility in capacity utilization. Virtual capacity exchange platforms help to mitigate this challenge by exchanging capacities with anonymous participants in market-like peer-to-peer networks. However, its efficiency is hindered by behavioral uncertainties, including a lack of inter-organizational trust in other participants. To leverage the potential of such exchange platforms, this paper reports on a Design Science Research project aiming to derive and validate design principles for establishing trust in inter-organizational capacity exchange in two design iterations. Using blockchain technology, we instantiate six design principles into an artifact and perform experimental evaluations to investigate their effect on perceived trust. Our paper contributes to research and practice by identifying and applying prescriptive design knowledge and advancing our understanding of how to design trust-enabling inter-organizational systems. The originality lies within the empirical investigation of how and why different design principle combinations can be established through blockchain technology as one of the promising approaches for establishing trust. In doing this, we also disclose future pathways for IS and blockchain researchers and practitioners.",

Using multivariate regression analysis, we find that blockchain fees in USD increase with network congestion, measured by the mempool count, in a non-linear manner as hypothesized by Huberman et al. (2021). Additionally, the fees are positively influenced by the respective native currency's returns over the past six months. The Merge resulted in a fee reduction for both Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.",

This research article presents a novel approach to enhance IoT security by leveraging collaborative threat intelligence and integrating blockchain technology with machine learning (ML) models. The iOS application acts as a central control centre, facilitating the reporting and sharing of detected threats. The shared threat data is securely stored on a blockchain network, enabling ML models to access and learn from a diverse range of threat scenarios. The research focuses on implementing Random Forest, Decision Tree classifier, Ensemble, LSTM, and CNN models on the IoT23 dataset within the context of a Collaborative Threat Intelligence Framework for IoT Security. Through an iterative process, the modelsâ accuracy is improved by reducing false negatives through the collaborative threat intelligence system. The article investigates the implementation details, privacy considerations, and the seamless integration of ML-based techniques for continuous model improvement. Experimental evaluations on the IoT23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in enhancing IoT security and mitigating potential threats. The research contributes to the advancement of collaborative threat intelligence and blockchain technology in the context of IoT security, paving the way for more secure and reliable IoT deployments.",

This article contributes by advancing an original approach to blockchain-based applications defined as Civic Blockchain. It is implemented with a wallet app currently experimented upon in local communities.\nOur approach is informed by an analysis of the critical literature on ethical and design dilemmas concerning blockchain for social impact. The conceptual framework revolves around three principles (Internet of Values 2.0, disintermediation of services, and local adaptation), that are reflected in our technical choices. The approach makes blockchains accessible to local community members, leveraging some of their core affordances and advancing new interpretations with a focus on technical and economic accessibility. Blockchain technology can support new socio-economic practices on a local level when intentional actions are undertaken by developers and users to address the societal challenges.",

Keeping this relevance in the banking sector, the current study aims to synthesize the body of knowledge on blockchain adoption for sustainability in developing countries while encapsulating challenges and opportunities using a systematic literature review. It offers a review of scholarly published articles published between 2010 and 2022 in EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The findings of the study revealed that scalability, the lack of operability among the blockchain service providers, and the absence of favorable regulatory laws and generally accepted rules were the major hurdles in the way of blockchain adoption in developing countries. Implantation of smart contracts, risk management, risk mitigation and faster payment are the opportunities for the banking sectors of developing countries to increase trust and transparency in their financial systems as well as formalization of their economy. However, the studies concluded that upon the adoption of blockchain technologies, there will be ease in financial transactions and transfers of money for financial institutions. Other challenges highlighted by the studies included threats of cybercrimes and privacy breaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe progress in industrial and corporate blockchain technology, particularly the pioneering fintech financing methods rooted in blockchain like Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Security Token Offerings (STOs), has the potential to disrupt across industries. These innovations offer creative solutions to address longstanding challenges. However, the novelty of these concepts has given rise to issues related to information asymmetry among investors, exacerbated by the opinions shared on social media platforms. To comprehensively analyse the trends of these technologies and their societal impact, as well as their influence on the contemporary business landscape, we conducted a study in the social platforms X (formerly known as Twitter) analysing 59,453 tweets using natural language processing (NLP). Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market. Thus, the idea that user opinions play a crucial role in influencing decisions is supported, and their impact can fluctuate depending on the changing dynamics of the market.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe consortium blockchain has been widely applied in various fields such as agricultural product traceability, supply chain management, and logistics transportation. As an indispensable component of a consortium blockchain, the consensus algorithm ensures the consistency and trustworthiness of each node in the network. However, existing consensus algorithms in large-scale consortium blockchain scenarios suffer from low system throughput and high latency due to the complexity of communication processes, rendering them impractical for real-world use. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel consensus algorithm called credit evaluation-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (CE-PBFT). This algorithm designs a new node credit evaluation model that considers node completion rate, consensus decay, and node behavior. It effectively measures and reflects the specific reliability status of nodes during system operation, thereby enhancing system reliability and security. Additionally, the paper introduces the innovative use of decision tree algorithms to analyze network node behavior and simplifies the existing consensus protocol. Nodes are categorized as excellent, good, ordinary, or poor based on the classification results, and non-Byzantine nodes are dynamically selected accordingly. This greatly improves the overall efficiency of the system. The performance of CE-PBFT is validated through experiments and compared with PBFT, G-PBFT, RBFT, WBFT and PPoR. Experimental results demonstrate that in large-scale consortium scenarios, CE-PBFT significantly improves system throughput, effectively reduces transaction latency and communication overhead, and outperforms the compared protocols.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFederated learning (FL) allows data owners to train neural networks together without sharing local data, allowing the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to share a variety of data. However, traditional FL frameworks suffer from data heterogeneity and outdated models. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual-blockchain based multi-layer grouping federated learning (BMFL) architecture. BMFL divides the participant groups based on the training tasks, then realizes the model training by combining synchronous and asynchronous FL through the multi-layer grouping structure, and uses the model blockchain to record the characteristic tags of the global model, allowing group-manners to extract the model based on the feature requirements and solving the problem of data heterogeneity. In addition, to protect the privacy of the model gradient parameters and manage the key, the global model is stored in ciphertext, and the chameleon hash algorithm is used to perform the modification and management of the encrypted key on the key blockchain while keeping the block header hash unchanged. Finally, we evaluate the performance of BMFL on different public datasets and verify the practicality of the scheme with real fault datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed BMFL exhibits more stable and accurate convergence behavior than the classic FL algorithm, and the key revocation overhead time is reasonable.",

We study intraorganizational blockchains from an agency perspective to understand how the distributed, sequenced, and consensus-based nature of blockchains mitigates information asymmetries and affects organizational structures. First, we explain how blockchains differ from conventional relational, contractual, and system-based mechanisms to address three pertinent information challengesâconcentration, continuity, and conflict. Subsequently, we address the consequences of introducing such blockchains, arguing that they create both direct and sequenced information channels among principals and agents, which elicit an organizational reconfiguration via vertical disintermediation and lateral reintermediation. Finally, we theorize the implications of blockchain-based organizing for agency theory regarding the chain of command, the unity of direction, and the span of control. Overall, we show how blockchains for intraorganizational governance can mitigate principal-agent problems and impact organizational design in profound ways.",

    "abstract": "In permissioned blockchain networks, the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, which uses the election of authorized nodes to validate transactions and blocks, has been widely advocated thanks to its high transaction throughput and fault tolerance. However, PoA suffers from the drawback of centralization dominated by a limited number of authorized nodes and the lack of anonymity due to the round-robin block proposal mechanism. As a result, traditional PoA is vulnerable to a single point of failure that compromises the security of the blockchain network. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized reputation management mechanism for permissioned blockchain networks to enhance security, promote liveness, and mitigate centralization while retaining the same throughput as traditional PoA. This paper aims to design an off-chain reputation evaluation and an on-chain reputation-aided consensus. First, we evaluate the nodesâ reputation in the context of the blockchain networks and make the reputation globally verifiable through smart contracts. Second, building upon traditional PoA, we propose a reputation-aided PoA (rPoA) consensus to enhance security without sacrificing throughput. In particular, rPoA can incentivize nodes to autonomously form committees based on reputation authority, which prevents block generation from being tracked through the randomness of reputation variation. Moreover, we develop a reputation-aided fork-choice rule for rPoA to promote the networkâs liveness. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed rPoA achieves higher security performance while retaining transaction throughput compared to traditional PoA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCounterfeit products have become a significant problem for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), with the estimated value of counterfeit goods worldwide reaching trillions of dollars. However, SMBs often lack the resources and technical expertise to implement sophisticated anti-counterfeiting measures. Towards this end, the work proposes a blockchain-based solution named as Fake Product Identification for Small and Medium Firms (FPISMF) using Hyperledger and AES encryption to enable SMBs to identify fake products and protect their brand reputation. The details of the products and the details of customers are encrypted using AES encryption and recorded on the blockchain. The application communicates with the blockchain network to validate the product and retrieve the details of the product. Chaincode is executed in a containerized environment, which provides isolation and security for the code and data being processed. An algorithm is also proposed to substitute the missing QR-code bits and data that helps reduce customer wait time. Experiments are conducted on synthesized data sets and results showing the effectiveness of the proposed FPISMF framework and reconciliation technique. It is observed from the results that though the time taken to replace a blurry bit is greatly reduced as compared to manual replacement of the product, there is an increase in this time when associated with encryption while extraction of the corresponding code from cloud database thereby achieving a time complexity of O(n), where ânâ is the number of scanned products. In addition, the AES SMB time complexity is approximately recoded as O(n/2) and the Cloud access and retrieval time is O(n) as compared to O(2n) in the existing work. This shows a significant improvement in the ability to replace missing bits and perform a secure analysis respectively.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain-enabled cybersecurity system to ensure and strengthen decentralized digital transaction is gradually gaining popularity in the digital era for various areas like finance, transportation, healthcare, education, and supply chain management. Blockchain interactions in the heterogeneous network have fascinated more attention due to the authentication of their digital application exchanges. However, the exponential development of storage space capabilities across the blockchain-based heterogeneous network has become an important issue in preventing blockchain distribution and the extension of blockchain nodes. There is the biggest challenge of data integrity and scalability, including significant computing complexity and inapplicable latency on regional network diversity, operating system diversity, bandwidth diversity, node diversity, etc., for decision-making of data transactions across blockchain-based heterogeneous networks. Data security and privacy have also become the main concerns across the heterogeneous network to build smart IoT ecosystems. To address these issues, todayâs researchers have explored the potential solutions of the capability of heterogeneous network devices to perform data transactions where the system stimulates their integration reliably and securely with blockchain.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nProtecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.",

Aiming at the possible problems of privacy leakage in the current electronic bidding and auction, this paper proposes an electronic bidding auction system based on blockchain against malicious adversaries, which uses the secure multi-party computation to realize secure bidding auction protocol without any trusted third party. The protocol proposed in this paper is an electronic bidding auction scheme based on the threshold elliptic curve cryptography. It can be implemented without any third party to complete the bidding auction for some malicious behaviors of the participants, which can solve the problem of resisting malicious adversary attacks. The security of the protocol is proved by the real/ideal model paradigm, and the efficiency of the protocol is analyzed. The efficiency of the protocol is verified by simulating experiments, and the protocol has practical value.",

The scheme utilizes a decentralized blockchain storage mechanism to enable remote storage of digital forensic data. Additionally, it leverages smart contract mechanisms to facilitate efficient retrieval and tracing of related evidence chains. To enhance data security of IIoT device nodes, a token mechanism is implemented for access control. Moreover, to meet real-time evidence acquisition requirements in IIoT, an efficient batch consensus mechanism is proposed. Experimental simulations demonstrate the superiority of the novel consensus algorithm compared to the traditional Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus in the proposed scheme for the IIoT environment. It meets speed requirements for evidence collection, ensuring tamper-proof, non-repudiable, and permanent storage of digital forensic data. Consequently, the application of blockchain technology for judicial access and evidence storage has made significant contributions to digital forensics within the IIoT context.",

But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.",

There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that integrates Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and advanced cryptographic techniques to address these challenges and enhance the security and transparency of transactions. This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions. This work highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized protocols in revolutionizing security and transparency across diverse sectors.",

On the one hand, smart contractsâ faster cycle time, lower fraud, and lower fees and charges have ensured that the business logic satisfies the stakeholderâs criteria. Agile approaches, on the other hand, are development processes that use incremental and iterative engineering methodologies to drive the system life cycle. Such methodologies are typically well-suited for incorporating and adapting management ideas early in the development life cycle. To reconcile both viewpoints, this work provides an organization modeling for constructing smart contracts on the blockchain utilizing organizational modeling techniques that allow all processes as well as the smart contracts management discipline in supply chain finance system development to be illustrated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAdaptor signature, a new primitive that alleviates the scalability issue of blockchain to some extent, has been widely adopted in the off-chain payment channel and atomic swap. As an extension of standard digital signature, adaptor signature can bind the release of a complete digital signature with the exchange of a secret value. Existing constructions of adaptor signatures are mainly based on Schnorr or ECDSA signature algorithms, which suffer low signing efficiency and long signature length. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a new construction of adaptor signature using randomized EdDSA, which has Schnorr-like structure with higher signing efficiency and shorter signature length. We prove the required security properties, including unforgeability, witness extractability and pre-signature adaptability, of the new adaptor signature scheme in the random oracle model. We conduct a comparative analysis with an ECDSA-based adaptor signature scheme to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our new proposal.",

The system relies on frequent communication for data exchange between the MaaS provider and transport service providers. Ideally, such communication would utilize trust technologies between these entities. However, current MaaS systems lack transparency and reliability, and their centralized nature creates a single point of failure for the entire service. To address these issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based MaaS, which includes an architecture and smart contract functionalities. The solutions are built on permissioned and permissionless Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum blockchain platforms, respectively, for a realistic deployment of network architecture and proposed smart contracts. Additionally, the paper presents a framework derived from comparing these two blockchain platforms. Finally, the framework is evaluated, and open questions and challenges are analysed.",

    "abstract": "Privacy and trust are significant issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Data security is critical in ITS systems since sensitive user data is communicated to another user over the internet through wireless devices and routes such as radio channels, optical fiber, and blockchain technology. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of connected, interconnected gadgets. Privacy issues occasionally arise due to the amount of data generated. However, they have been primarily addressed by blockchain and smart contract technology. While there are still security issues with smart contracts, primarily due to the complexity of writing the code, there are still many challenges to consider when designing blockchain designs for the IoT environment. This study uses traditional blockchain technology with the âYou Only Look Onceâ (YOLO) object detection method to accurately locate and identify license plates. While YOLO and blockchain technologies used for intelligent vehicle license plate recognition are promising, they have received limited research attention. Real-time object identification and recognition would be possible by combining a cutting-edge object detection technique with a regional convolutional neural network (RCNN) built with the tensor flow core open source libraries. This method works reasonably well for identifying any license plate. The Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) approach delivered outstanding results in various datasets. First, with a recognition rate of 96.2%, our system (UFPR-ALPR) surpassed the previously used technology, consisting of 4500 frames and around 150 films. Second, a deep learning algorithm was trained to recognize images of license plate numbers using the UFPR-ALPR dataset. Third, the license plateâs characters were complicated for standard methods to identify because of the shifting lighting correctly. The proposed model, however, produced beneficial outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology offers great value in terms of decentralization, data integrity, transparency, and traceability, however the transactional data is public, and accessible raising concerns about violating privacy regulations. For example, in the peer-to-peer energy trading and demand response use cases, the data stored in blockchain may allow a third party to infer the load profiles or even identify the behind the meter assets. In this paper, we employ homomorphic techniques to encrypt the energy transactional data stored on the blockchain allowing the smart contracts functions responsible for implementing the business logic of the energy flexibility trading and settlement to perform computations on encrypted data. As computations on smart contracts and public blockchains can be expensive, we have used the lighter version of the Partial Homomorphic Encryption scheme to obfuscate the energy data. To ensure the validity of the smart contracts' functions executed on encrypted data, we leverage on the consensus mechanism of the blockchain network, thus ensuring computation correctness. The solution was validated considering a micro-grid with 12 prosumers that trade their flexibility peer-to-peer (P2P). The results demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining encrypted energy data on the blockchain, executing smart contract functions on encrypted data, and preserving the privacy of computations. As anticipated, the trade-off for better privacy is the gas consumption overhead of the smart contractsâ functions which is higher compared to the non-encrypted case, depending on the length of the public-private keys pair. Nonetheless, our solution exhibits consistent execution times for smart contracts, making it suitable for private networks where gas costs are of minimal concern.",

However, current e-prescription systems have vulnerabilities, including erroneous information, hacking attempts, a single point of failure, and medical fraud. In addition to affecting the quality of data reporting, these issues violate a patientâs rights to data privacy. One promising solution is a blockchain-based prescription system. Blockchainâs immutable ledger accurately traces medical fraud and erroneous information, while its decentralized nature reduces the impact of failures. Performance is an important consideration, as healthcare systems need to be scalable and time-sensitive. This study aims to understand the performance and security of blockchain-based prescription systems. It focuses on evaluating system performance and scalability when using different encryption algorithms. The study found that using the most secure technology had only a small performance impact for all prototype features except key generation and report viewing. In addition, the results suggest that the proposed systemâs scalability is sufficient to service the entire Philippines. This knowledge will help improve prescription systems to protect patientsâ rights and improve report reliability.",

This architecture achieves efficient and secure Internet of Things data sharing through client node clustering and blockchain consensus processes. In addition, to address the issue of imbalanced distribution of data labels in system devices, a device clustering federated learning algorithm based on label similarity is designed to improve the accuracy and stability of the model. The experimental results showed that under independent synchronous data distribution and non independent synchronous data distribution, the research algorithm achieved a 95 % accuracy after 30 iterations, and the communication cost was relatively low. When testing algorithm stability under non independent synchronous data distribution, the more label categories there are, the higher the accuracy. When the label category M = 12, the accuracy could reach 96.0 %. In the medical sharing system of a certain hospital, the research system took about 42.9 % less time to extract information than the original system, and the accuracy could be maintained at over 98 %. This research method can effectively solve the problem of uneven distribution of device data labels, and improve the data transmission efficiency and accuracy of Internet of Things data sharing systems. Moreover, this method can also reduce the impact of malicious nodes on the global model, providing technical support for data transmission and security protection in other fields.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in IoT (Internet of Things) devices comes an inherent challenge of security. In the world today, privacy is the prime concern of every individual. Preserving oneâs privacy and keeping anonymity throughout the system is a desired functionality that does not come without inevitable trade-offs like scalability and increased complexity and is always exceedingly difficult to manage. The challenge is keeping confidentiality and continuing to make the person innominate throughout the system. To address this, we present our proposed architecture where we manage IoT devices using blockchain technology. Our proposed architecture works on and off blockchain integrated with the closed-circuit television (CCTV) security camera fixed at the rental property. In this framework, the CCTV security camera feed is redirected towards the owner and renter based on the smart contract conditions. One entity (owner or renter) can see the CCTV security camera feed at one time. There is no third-party dependence except for the CCTV security camera deployment phase. Our contributions include the proposition of framework architecture, a novel smart contract algorithm, and the modification to the ring signatures leveraging an existing cryptographic technique. Analyses are made based on different systemsâ security and key management areas. In an empirical study, our proposed algorithm performed better in key generation, proof generation, and verification times. By comparing similar existing schemes, we have shown the proposed architecturesâ advantages. Until now, we have developed this system for a specific area in the real world. However, this system is scalable and applicable to other areas like healthcare monitoring systems, which is part of our future work.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIndustrial cyberâphysical systems (ICPS) are emerging platforms for various industrial applications. For instance, remote healthcare monitoring, real-time healthcare data generation, and many other applications have been integrated into the ICPS platform. These healthcare applications encompass workflow tasks, such as processing within hospitals, laboratory tests, and insurance companies for patient payments, which necessitate a sequential flow. The external wireless, fog, and cloud services within ICPS face security issues that impact end-usersâ healthcare applications. Blockchain technology offers an optimal solution for ICPS-enabled applications. However, blockchain technology for the ICPS platform is still vulnerable to cyberattacks, while microservices are essential for executing applications. This paper introduces the novel âPattern-Proof Malware Validationâ (PoPMV) algorithm designed for blockchain in ICPS. It exploits a deep learning model (LSTM) with reinforcement learning techniques to receive feedback and rewards in real-time. The primary objective is to mitigate security vulnerabilities, enhance processing speed, identify both familiar and unfamiliar attacks, and optimize the functionality of ICPS. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to current blockchain frameworks, showcasing dynamic allocation of microservices and improved security with comprehensive attack detection by 30%.",

Blockchain applications exhibit the potential to mitigate counterfeit risks and facilitate the growing secondary markets by enabling product authentication and digital proof of ownership. In this study, we adopt a qualitative multiple-case study design and conduct interviews with informants from four blockchain projects in the Swiss luxury watch industry. We identify the industry-specific drivers and barriers to blockchain adoption and specifically explore the challenges at the physicalâdigital interface. Beyond an in-depth description of the problems, our findings suggest two main data management hurdles related to the validity of input data and data synchronicity. The main challenge, however, is to establish an unequivocal link between the physical watch to its digital record on the blockchain. We present several invasive and non-invasive linking approaches and discuss their potential advantages and disadvantages. Further, we outline different areas for future research. Overall, our study addresses a timely issue of blockchain applications, contributing to the operations and supply chain management literature and supporting blockchain use case design in practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rise in legislation and the need for task automation systems has resulted in an amplified requirement for software development. This is aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of reading and interpreting laws in legal activities, allowing for enhanced precision and swiftness. Currently, there is a need for analysts to interpret written legislation and then encode it into computer programs, which often leads to errors. As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, there is growing interest in utilizing Blockchain technology in the legal field. Specifically, smart contracts can be used to integrate business rules into laws and automate blockchain management. However, the process of writing fast and high-quality code can be improved by leveraging artificial intelligence based techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) to help practitioners. Despite reviewing the current state-of-the-art, there is a lack of existing work that combines smart contracts and NLP in the context of legislation analysis. This study work generates intelligent code from legislation analysis, utilizing NLP and Blockchain for this purpose. In this research work a pilot prototype for smart contract generation is developed and initial code samples are presented. This work demonstrates a promising results with 96% accuracy in Name Entity Recognition (NER) and also highlights the importance of smart contract generation through NLP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn todayâs world of decentralized production, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are facing more than ever an increasing complexity in their order management processes. On the one hand, they deal with issues related to data transparency, traceability, and security in constant back-and-forth communication exchange between customers and sub-contractors having to confirm the order status. On the other hand, there are significant obstacles when it comes to integrating their traditional order management systems with the partner organizationâs information systems within the production network. These complexities tend to decrease the ability of OEMs to remain flexible and profitable. Therefore, they are constantly looking for feasible solutions to overcome these issues and improve their order management processes. To this aim, this work proposes a novel blockchain-based conceptual framework for order management that intends to establish a secure environment for efficient communication and data integrity. The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain makes it capable of providing real-time data as well as ensuring data security and transparency. Furthermore, this work also set up basic level SQLite3 databases and design prototypical on-chain and off-chain smart contract logics that can be used to automate various operations and decisions making in order management, thereby, improving the overall order processing efficiency. According to the authors knowledge, there is no such framework available in research. Therefore, it is suggested that organization can utilize the proposed framework to develop their own blockchain based order management systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIndustry 5.0 is seen as the next stage of the industrial revolution. However, the centralized management of the vast amount of data in Industry 5.0 poses significant security challenges. Because blockchain can provide a stable decentralized network for data in Industry 5.0, blockchain technology becomes an ideal solution for the security of data in Industry 5.0. However, with the explosion of data in Industry 5.0, the rapidly growing storage requirements are putting unbearable pressure on nodes and users, making it especially important to address the scalability of the blockchain. While using light nodes can alleviate storage pressure on nodes, it can also lead to data availability attacks. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trusted data storage mechanism for Industry 5.0. The mechanism combines sharding and two-layer Merkle tree structures, and employs random low-density parity codes to code the tree. It enables light nodes to verify the authenticity of data and solve data availability attacks while improving the throughput of the blockchain. In addition, by using erasure codes to construct low-storage blockchain nodes, the network load of the nodes is effectively reduced, which solves the scalability issues of the blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs smart contracts, represented by Solidity, become deeply integrated into the manufacturing industry, blockchain-based Digital Twins (DT) has gained momentum in recent years. Most of the blockchain infrastructures in widespread use today are based on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism, and the process of creating blocks is known as âminingâ. Mining becomes increasingly difficult as the blockchain grows in size and the number of on-chain business systems increases. To lower the threshold of participation in the mining process, âmining poolsâ have been created. Miners can cooperate and share the mining rewards according to the hashrate they contributed to the pool. Stratum is the most widely used communication protocol between miners and mining pools. Its security is essential for the participants. In this paper, we propose two novel Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack schemes against Stratum, which allow attackers to steal miners' hashrate to any mining pool using hijacked TCP connections. Compared with existing attacks, our work is more secretive, more suitable for the real-world environment, and more harmful. The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) shows that our schemes work perfectly on most mining softwares and pools. Furthermore, we present a lightweight AI-driven approach based on protocol-level feature analysis to detect Stratum MITM for blockchain-based DTs. Its detection model consists of three layers: feature extraction layer, vectorization layer, and detection layer. Experiments prove that our detection approach can effectively detect Stratum MITM traffic with 98% accuracy. Our work alerts the communities and provides possible mitigation against these more hidden and profitable attack schemes.",

Blockchain, as a decentralized distributed ledger with decentralization, traceability and tamper-proof features, is an important way to achieve efficient consumption and multi-party supply of new energy. In this article, we establish a blockchain-based mathematical model of multiple microgrids and microgrid aggregatorsâ revenue, consider the degree of microgrid usersâ preference for electricity thus increasing usersâ reliance on the blockchain market, and apply the one-master-multiple-slave Stackelberg game theory to solve the energy dispatching strategy when each market entity pursues the maximum revenue. The simulation results show that the blockchain-based dynamic game of the multi-microgrid market can effectively increase the revenue of both microgrids and aggregators and improve the utilization of renewable energy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe space-air-ground-sea three-dimensional (3D) network is a comprehensive communication network system. This 3D network combines extensive coverage of satellite communications, adaptability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, reliability of terrestrial communications, and the necessity for maritime communications. These networks generate enormous amounts of data, and training machine learning (ML) models on this data will have a significant impact on industry. At the same time, the availability of such data poses numerous security threats, which can be overcome using Federated Learning (FL). Decentralized training in FL can provide a universal model from local data generated by 3D networks. However, most existing FL frameworks have a centralized server, which questions credibility, single-point failure, and global confidence. To solve these problems, industrial blockchain technology has received a lot of attention by replacing centralized servers in traditional FL, which offers a promising approach to address key issues like data privacy and security. In a blockchain-based system, digital signatures are a core component for ensuring data integrity and system security, however, private key disclosure can pose significant risks. Security can be enhanced by using threshold signatures which provide a more reliable foundation for FL by storing keys in multiple nodes and requiring multiple nodes to collaborate to generate signatures. In this paper, we propose a Threshold signing scheme for ISO/IEC Digital Signature Standards (TDSS) in an industrial blockchain. The TDSS scheme helps FL to achieve truly distributed decentralization for unified space-air-ground-sea model training. The TDSS scheme exploits the SM-2 digital signature algorithm in the ISO/IEC standard when\nout of\nnodes in an industrial blockchain interact with each other to calculate the signature. The experimental results and analysis show that the TDSS scheme has provable security and efficient against security attacks, which can be applied to large-scale threshold signing scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe sixth-generation (6G) network utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning technology and obtains high attention, while the fifth-generation (5G) industry is still developing globally. Unfortunately, 6G encounters challenges to achieve performance superiority, such as scalability, massive connection, integrity, and trust. As a result, future network technologies are migrating away from centralized management entities and toward decentralized and distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. However, the security of the blockchain is based on the computational complexity of solving specific mathematical problems that are impossible to solve on existing computers in real-time. On the other hand, quantum computers can effortlessly translate such problems with easy decryption. As a result, this study presents an architecture demonstrating the integration of quantum blockchain (QBC) with 6G networks. To show the quantum advantage, highly entangled/secured QBC of 5-, 6-, and 7-qubits are used to create the above systemâs quantum circuits. After circuit optimization, mitigation is executed with the efficiency analysis to show the advantage of the error mitigation approach in recreating the state of the QBC circuit and executing on quantum hardware. Furthermore, quantum algorithms of blockchain smart provenience contracts for the cloud-centric Internet of Things (IoT) are proposed, and corresponding quantum circuits are designed. The possible outcomes from these circuits based on the input transaction information are verified.",

    "abstract": "Load forecasting is a crucial aspect of intelligent Virtual Power Plant (VPP) management and a means of balancing the relationship between distributed power grids and traditional power grids. However, due to the continuous emergence of power consumption peaks, the power supply quality of the power grid cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, an intelligent calculation method is required to effectively predict the load, enabling better power grid dispatching and ensuring the stable operation of the power grid. This paper proposes a decentralized heterogeneous federated distillation learning algorithm (DHFDL) to promote trusted federated learning (FL) between different federates in the blockchain. The algorithm comprises two stages: common knowledge accumulation and personalized training. In the first stage, each federate on the blockchain is treated as a meta-distribution. After aggregating the knowledge of each federate circularly, the model is uploaded to the blockchain. In the second stage, other federates on the blockchain download the trained model for personalized training, both of which are based on knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that the DHFDL algorithm proposed in this paper can resist a higher proportion of malicious code compared to FedAvg and a Blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with Committee consensus (BFLC). Additionally, by combining asynchronous consensus with the FL model training process, the DHFDL training time is the shortest, and the training efficiency of decentralized FL is improved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a new balanced economy, the green economy guides the upgrade and transformation of industrial structures based on the original concept of sustainable development. Reducing carbon emissions is indispensable for achieving better and faster green economic development. From a functional perspective, forestry carbon sinks have good carbon sequestration potential and have positive attributes, such as climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance, for the entire ecosystem. To promote the continuous development of forestry carbon sink trading in China, blockchain, a new technology with several advantages such as traceability, supervision, and tamper-proofness, has emerged, which creates a good market trading environment and has made a breakthrough in the trading mode. If forestry carbon sink trading is effectively supported, organic combinations and simultaneous synergistic development can be conducted, which will open new avenues for the carbon sink economy. In this study, a game model of the forest carbon sink trading mode under blockchain technology was constructed from the perspective of traders, and influential factors, such as the carbon sink available for sale by the supply side and the demand side's perspective towards emission reduction, were considered. Subsequently, the MATLAB R2020b software was used to conduct a simulation analysis of the transactions, thereby showing the evolutionary path of the game between the two sides and the influence mechanism of the addition of blockchain technology on the evolution trajectory of the demand-side decision. The findings indicate that, from the perspective of participating traders, the inclusion of blockchain technology in forestry carbon sink trading resulted in positive effects. Moreover, the greater the probability that the carbon sinks available for sale in the market can meet the demand, the more likely the demand side is to participate in the transaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEnsuring strict adherence to security during the phases of Android app development is essential, primarily due to the prevalent issue of apps being released without adequate security measures in place. While a few automated tools are employed to reduce potential vulnerabilities during development, their effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities may fall short. To address this, âDefendroidâ, a blockchain-based federated neural network enhanced with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is introduced in this work. Trained on the LVDAndro dataset, the vanilla neural network model achieves a 96% accuracy and 0.96 F1-Score in binary classification for vulnerability detection. Additionally, in multi-class classification, the model accurately identifies Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories with a 93% accuracy and 0.91 F1-Score. In a move to foster collaboration and model improvement, the model has been deployed within a blockchain-based federated environment. This environment enables community-driven collaborative training and enhancements in partnership with other clients. The extended model demonstrates improved accuracy of 96% and F1-Score of 0.96 in both binary and multi-class classifications. The use of XAI plays a pivotal role in presenting vulnerability detection results to developers, offering prediction probabilities for each word within the code. This model has been integrated into an Application Programming Interface (API) as the backend and further incorporated into Android Studio as a plugin, facilitating real-time vulnerability detection. Notably, Defendroid exhibits high efficiency, delivering prediction probabilities for a single code line in an average processing time of a mere 300 ms. The weight-sharing transparency in the blockchain-driven federated model enhances trust and traceability, fostering community engagement while preserving source code privacy and contributing to accuracy improvement.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) access control mechanism may encounter security issues such as single point of failure and data tampering. To address these issues, a blockchain-based IoT reputation value attribute access control scheme is proposed. Firstly, writing the reputation value as an attribute into the access control policy, and then deploying the access control policy in the smart contract of the blockchain system can enable the system to provide more fine-grained access control; Secondly, storing a large amount of resources from the Internet of Things in Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) to improve system throughput; Finally, map resource access operations to qualification tokens to improve the performance of the access control system. Complete simulation experiments based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. From the simulation experimental results, it can be seen that the access control system can achieve more fine-grained and dynamic access control while maintaining high throughput and low time delay, providing sufficient reliability and security for access control of IoT devices.",

This study introduces a novel feature to the metaverse by capturing a fundamental aspect of individualsâtheir conversationsâand transforming them into digital assets. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning methods to extract a key sentence from user conversations and matches them with emojis that reflect their sentiments. The selected sentence, which encapsulates the essence of the userâs statements, is then transformed into digital art through a generative visual model. This digital artwork is transformed into a non-Fungible Token (NFT), becoming a valuable digital asset within the blockchain ecosystem that is ideal for integration into metaverse applications. Our aim is that the management of personality traits as digital assets will foster individual uniqueness, enrich user experiences, and facilitate more personalized services and interactions with both like-minded users and non-player characters, thereby enhancing the overall user journey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe cold chain supply chain of e-commerce has the characteristics of long chain, dispersed production, heterogeneous information sources, etc., which is easy to cause the upstream and downstream information of the supply chain to be broken and opaque. Traditional traceability data is stored in each node enterprise, and there are problems such as low cooperation trust and poor authenticity in the upstream and downstream data transmission process of the supply chain, resulting in consumers' trust crisis on the authenticity of traceability information. Blockchain traceability system through the establishment of multi-party participation, joint maintenance of distributed database, and the use of cryptography and consensus mechanism to establish trust relationships, with data can not be tampered with, sharing of high credibility. On the basis of stochastic Petri net theory, this study constructed a blockchain e-commerce cold chain traceability model centering on the actual application of blockchain technology in logistics traceability to improve the reliability and validity of e-commerce cold chain traceability. Correlation matrix and invariants were used to analyze the validity of the model, and an isomorphic Markov chain was constructed to analyze the effectiveness evolution of the model. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the cold chain traceability system of blockchain e-commerce from the three aspects of the best optimization link, the best synergism scale, and the adaptive ability of the system to provide reference for the improvement of cold chain traceability ability by blockchain technology.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have revolutionized a wide range of industries, including monitoring, agriculture, surveillance, and supply chain. However, their widespread use also poses significant challenges, such as public safety, privacy, and cybersecurity. Cyberattacks, targeting UAVs have become more frequent, which highlights the need for robust security solutions. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies has the potential to address these challenges. This study suggests a platform that utilizes blockchain technology to manage drone operations securely and confidentially. By incorporating blockchain technology, the proposed method aims to increase the security and privacy of drone data. The suggested platform stores information on a public blockchain located on Ethereum and leverages the Ganache platform to ensure secure and private blockchain transactions. The MetaMask wallet for Ethbalance is necessary for BCT transactions. The present research finding shows that the proposed approachâs efficiency and security features are superior to existing methods. This study contributes to the development of a secure and efficient system for managing drone operations that could have significant applications in various industries. The proposed platformâs security measures could mitigate privacy concerns, minimize cyber security risk, and enhance public safety, ultimately promoting the widespread adoption of UAVs. The results of the study demonstrate that the blockchain can ensure the fulfillment of core security needs such as authentication, privacy preservation, confidentiality, integrity, and access control.",

Small construction projects in Malaysia always need help adopting new technology like blockchain. This research aimed to investigate the challenges affecting the implementation of blockchain technology in small construction projects in Malaysia. The study examined Malaysian minor construction project blockchain implementation issues. A total of 17 challenges were found significant in affecting the implementation of Blockchain technology in small construction projects in Malaysia. Five constructs were seen: technological barriers, work environment barriers, economic and planning barriers, operational barriers, and privacy and regulation barriers. Structural equation modeling and these structures create a blockchain implementation model for modest building projects. The model's validity, dependability, and forecast accuracy for all obstacles and their potential influence on blockchain deployment in small construction projects in Malaysia are substantial. The model also has good convergent and discriminant validity, supporting it. Blockchain use in Malaysian small building projects could be improved mainly through economic and planning issues. The present study needs to highlight the Malaysian small construction sector's essential obstacles in integrating blocks and technology that are the basis for more creative technologies. This research will help the Malaysian construction sector concentrate on improvements and assess the effect of blockchain on modest projects.",

Given the current maturity of digital twin technology (yet in progress), improving the models that these systems use is typically achieved off-line, requiring the system to stop and reconfigure to run each new model version. In fact, most works use cloud back-ends to run heavy machine learning algorithms, imposing strict requirements on the data exchange between the physical system and the cloud.\nWe address the online improvement of digital twin models in cyberâphysical systems by supporting model refinement without disrupting nor stopping the normal operation of the system. This improves the dynamicity of the system that may turn into a major competitive advantage in a number of industrial scenarios. Precisely, we exploit the collaborative expectation of next generation cyberâphysical systems based on highly-connected cells enabled by 5G and 6G networking; and on top of these, we design a shared space properly managed to deliver the needed temporal behaviour required by cyberâphysical systems.\nFor this, we present the design of CoTwin framework as a middleware that allows cells to collectively improve digital twin models seamlessly. CoTwin manages the interaction of cells with a blockchain-based collaborative space offering a built-in trusted storage model. We integrate neural network algorithms as they provide fast execution that meet the time-sensitivity requirements of cyberâphysical systems. Our contribution is validated by means of its implementation and deployment on an actual blockchain network, and an exhaustive set of experiments to analyse the resulting overhead and temporal behaviour. Results show that CoTwin achieves stable execution times across all its functional pieces; and it exhibits stable service time for large sets of cells.",

Nevertheless, scalability challenges, characterized by diminished broadcast efficiency, heightened communication overhead, and escalated storage costs, have significantly constrained the broad-scale application of blockchain. This paper introduces a novel Encode-and CRT-based Scalability Scheme (ECSS), meticulously refined to enhance both block broadcasting and storage. Primarily, ECSS categorizes nodes into distinct domains, thereby reducing the network diameter and augmenting transmission efficiency. Secondly, ECSS streamlines block transmission through a compact block protocol and robust RS coding, which not only reduces the size of broadcasted blocks but also ensures transmission reliability. Finally, ECSS utilizes the Chinese remainder theorem, designating the block body as the compression target and mapping it to multiple modules to achieve efficient storage, thereby alleviating the storage burdens on nodes. To evaluate ECSSâs performance, we established an experimental platform and conducted comprehensive assessments. Empirical results demonstrate that ECSS attains superior network scalability and stability, reducing communication overhead by an impressive 72% and total storage costs by a substantial 63.6%.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing holds broad applications in information acquisition and dissemination, yet encounters challenges pertaining to data quality assessment and user reputation management. Reputation mechanisms stand as crucial solutions for appraising and updating participant reputation scores, thereby elevating the quality and dependability of crowdsourced data. However, these mechanisms face several challenges in traditional crowdsourcing systems: 1) platform security lacks robust guarantees and may be susceptible to attacks; 2) there exists a potential for large-scale privacy breaches; and 3) incentive mechanisms relying on reputation scores may encounter issues as reputation updates hinge on task demander evaluations, occasionally lacking a dedicated reputation update module. This paper introduces a reputation update scheme tailored for crowdsourcing, with a focus on proficiently overseeing participant reputations and alleviating the impact of malicious activities on the sensing system. Here, the reputation update scheme is determined by an Empirical Cumulative distribution-based Outlier Detection method (ECOD). Our scheme embraces a blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework utilizing a homomorphic encryption method to ensure data transparency and tamper-resistance. Computation of user reputation scores relies on their behavioral history, actively discouraging undesirable conduct. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic weight incentive mechanism that mirrors alterations in participant reputation, enabling the system to allocate incentives based on user behavior and reputation. Our scheme undergoes evaluation on 11 datasets, revealing substantial enhancements in data credibility for crowdsourcing systems and a reduction in the influence of malicious behavior. This research not only presents a practical solution for crowdsourcing reputation management but also offers valuable insights for future research and applications, holding promise for fostering more reliable and high-quality data collection in crowdsourcing across diverse domains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIndustry 5.0 has introduced a novel interpretation of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) that emphasizes the importance of building a transparent and trustworthy network that can be continuously monitored and controlled through stakeholder collaboration as well as the use of advanced, intelligent machinery. The ultimate goal of SSCs is to meet specific economic, social, and environmental standards. The implementation of blockchain technology can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of the information exchanged among stakeholders in SSCs. However, these stakeholders inevitably possess varying informational advantages and exhibit divergent perspectives regarding the adoption of blockchain technology. This paper thus aims to examine the impediments to the adoption of blockchain technology in the context of SSCs with the goal of promoting blockchain adoption. To achieve this objective, this study analyzes the barriers to blockchain adoption from the perspectives of various stakeholders in SSCs and constructs a barrier severity assessment model that utilizes group decision-making methods to integrate all stakeholdersâ attitudes. This study employs the PEEST (political, economic, environmental, social, and technological) framework to identify 27 barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology. Subsequently, an expertise-based group decision-making approach is used to quantify the prominence of various barriers according to various types of stakeholders. The results indicate that the five most intense barriers are storage constraints, insufficient economic incentives, high integration costs, a lack of functional appeal, and ambiguity regarding data disclosure and public data management regulations. This research makes novel theoretical and practical contributions, as it takes an empirical and all-encompassing approach to identifying obstacles to the adoption of blockchain technology and provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to reference in overcoming these obstacles.",

We examine the activity in trading of voluntary carbon credits on a new blockchain-based exchange, which reduces the amount of intermediation in this market. Over the years 2021 and 2022, about 3.8 million tCO2e tokens have been tokenized on the carbon token exchange, of which about 2.8 million tCO2e tokens have been burned, leaving 1.0 million tCO2 tokens available for purchase on the exchange. Over these two years, the total secondary market trading turnover has been $ 21.2 million. Trading liquidity is limited to only a few types of carbon credit tokens. The prices of these most liquid tokens move in line with prices of similar carbon projects available for purchase elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "This research presents a reputation-based blockchain consensus mechanism called Proof of Intelligent Reputation (PoIR) as an alternative to traditional Proof of Work (PoW). PoIR addresses the limitations of existing reputation-based consensus mechanisms by proposing a more decentralized and fair node selection process. The proposed PoIR consensus combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with the Network Entity Reputation Database (NERD) to generate reputation scores for network entities and select authoritative nodes. NERD records network entity profiles based on various sources, i.e., Warden, Blacklists, DShield, AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX), and MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform). It summarizes these profile records into a reputation score value. The PoIR consensus mechanism utilizes these reputation scores to select authoritative nodes. The evaluation demonstrates that PoIR exhibits higher centralization resistance than PoS and PoW. Authoritative nodes were selected fairly during the 1000-block proposal round, ensuring a more decentralized blockchain ecosystem. In contrast, malicious nodes successfully monopolized 58% and 32% of transaction processes in PoS and PoW, respectively, but failed to do so in PoIR. The findings also indicate that PoIR offers efficient transaction times of 12 s, outperforms reputation-based consensus such as PoW, and is comparable to reputation-based consensus such as PoS. Furthermore, the model evaluation shows that BiLSTM outperforms other Recurrent Neural Network models, i.e., BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit), UniLSTM (Unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory), and UniGRU (Unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) with 0.022 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This study concludes that the PoIR consensus mechanism is more resistant to centralization than PoS and PoW. Integrating BiLSTM and NERD enhances the fairness and efficiency of blockchain applications.",

The model leverages the inherent characteristics of blockchain, including anti-tampering, transparency, and security, to establish a secure and trustworthy voting mechanism. By utilizing smart contract, the model automates voting, enforces rules, records ballots in real-time, and prevents double voting, thereby significantly reduces human errors and election fraud. It also ensures privacy, eliminates coercion, and realizes on-chain tallying using the Paillier homomorphic encryption. The model is analyzed in terms of security and deployed on Polygon, a sidechain of Ethereum. Comparisons with other schemes demonstrate that this model is also optimized for reducing gas cost.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is an emerging paradigm that offers numerous services at the infrastructure level for vehicle applications. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is an advanced form of ITS where diverse vehicle services are deployed on the roadside unit. V2I consists of distributed computing nodes where transport applications are parallel processed. Many research challenges exist in the presented V2I paradigms regarding security, cyber-attacks, and application processing among heterogeneous nodes. These cyber-attacks, Sybil attacks, and their attempts cause a lack of security and degrade the V2I performance in the presented paradigms. This paper presents a new secure blockchain framework that handles cyber-attacks, as mentioned earlier. This paper formulates this complex problem as a combinatorial problem, encompassing concave and convex problems. The convex function minimizes the given constraints, such as time and security risk, and the concave function improves performance and accuracy. Therefore, numerous constraints, such as time, energy, malware detection accuracy, and application deadlines, require optimization for the considered problem. Combining the jointly non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and long short-term memory (LSTM) schemes is the best way to meet the problemâs limitations. In this study, the paper designed a malware dataset with known and unknown malware. The different kinds of malware lists (e.g., cyber-attacks) are considered in the form of known and unknown malware lists with the characteristics, size of code, where malware comes from, attack on which data, and current status of the workload after being attacked by the malware. Our main idea is to present blockchain, NSGA-II, and LSTM schemes that handle phishing, routing, Sybil, and 51% of cyber-attacks without compromising application performance. Simulation results show that the study reduces delay and energy, improves accuracy, and minimizes security risks for vehicular applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently, with the rapid development of smart home technology, the demand for establishing efficient and sustainable smart home systems in rural areas is increasing. However, in rural environments, the effective management and intelligent control of green energy face many challenges. To address these issues, this work aims to design a smart home system based on blockchain technology to achieve efficient energy management and intelligent control in a green lighting environment in rural areas. The main goals include improving the performance and safety of the system to meet the lighting needs of rural areas and promote sustainable development. The system comprises two primary components: the home gateway and cloud services. These components encompass functions like data monitoring and transmission, cloud storage, and remote control. The work also introduces the structural interaction, user node interaction, and the data security transmission scheme of the smart home system. Ultimately, the system's effectiveness is confirmed through simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the system achieves the lowest latency when the transaction arrival rate is 40tps and the block size is 10. Additionally, the access control scheme based on the Hyperledger Fabric consortium chain can efficiently handle access requests for smart home resources and meet the practical application requirements within an appropriate range of security parameters. The main research conclusion is that the designed smart home system based on blockchain technology has achieved significant results in improving performance and security. This not only provides reliable lighting solutions for rural areas, but also provides important theoretical and practical guidance for the future development of smart home systems. The direction of future work includes further optimizing system performance, expanding the scope of application, and exploring more advanced blockchain technology applications in the field of smart homes. This will provide more possibilities and innovative directions for the development of future smart home systems.",

Current editable blockchain schemes with little regard for security in the editing process, and there is a lack of effective monitoring and auditing measures. These are also susceptible to the formation of a centralized trend of editing rights and bring privacy protection problems. Aiming at editable application requirements, to solve the problems of âwho will editâ and âthe security of editableâ, selection of node with editing rights and privacy protection mechanisms based on dual-blockchain are proposed, including data chain and audit chain. In the data chain, to avoid some nodes being in the chain for a long time, being used by attackers and editing rights tending to be centralized, heterogeneity among nodes is used as one of the decisions. An Execution Node Authority Confirmation Mechanism (ENACM) based on confidence, reliability, and heterogeneity is proposed. The performance of nodes at different stages can be effectively used. Node with editing rights is ensured to be unpredictable and protected from targeted attacks. In the audit chain, the Parameter Audit Mechanism (PAM) is proposed. To anonymously update and verify the parameters used in the ENACM, Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature, Pedersen commitment, and Schnorr signature are employed. Privacy protection is ensured for associated information of the node. A prototype system of the proposed scheme based on Hyperledger Fabric has been implemented.

Minimizing material delivery delays by comprehensively monitoring material supply chain processes via a blockchain network.\nâ¢\nReduction of Total Material Cost (TMC) achieved through implementing a blockchain inventory management smart contract.\nâ¢\nEmpowering stakeholders through real-time material information access, improved decision-making, and reduced supply delays.\nAbstract\nThe prevailing practices in construction supply chain management are characterised by significant challenges, including fragmentation, a lack of trust among stakeholders, and restricted information sharing. This research introduces a blockchain-based integrated system for managing construction materials and inventory to enhance the traceability and transparency of shared supply chain material information. This initiative will foster a collaborative and open supply chain environment among stakeholders and effectively address material delays, resulting in smoother project operations and minimized disruptions, thus promoting operational efficiency. Furthermore, the system's potential to substantially reduce the incidence of legal disputes is underpinned by the secure and tamper-proof storage of information within shared ledgers, fostering a high level of accountability and trustworthiness. The integration of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) approach within blockchain smart contracts streamlines procurement processes, leading to a noteworthy reduction in purchase orders and associated overhead costs. The study employs a Design Science Research (DSR) approach to create a decentralised construction supply chain system, monitoring changes in material information during the supply process and addressing uncertainties associated with managing construction material inventory. The proposed system empowers project stakeholders by providing real-time material information access, resulting in improved decision-making and a reduction in material delays. Additionally, the construction material management-based blockchain and smart system enables project parties to efficiently handle inventory for complex projects, interconnecting all supply chain tasks within an integrated smart contract. The usability of the proposed solution was assessed using a usability test technique, with participants confirming its applicability in construction environments. They highlighted key benefits, including reduced material purchasing costs, decreased legal disputes among project stakeholders, and improved decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe healthcare industry has witnessed a transformative impact due to recent advancements in sensing technology, coupled with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs)-based healthcare systems. Remote monitoring and informed decision-making have become possible by leveraging an integrated platform for efficient data analysis and processing, thereby optimizing data management in healthcare. However, this data is collected, processed, and transmitted across an interconnected network of devices, which introduces notable security risks and escalates the potential for vulnerabilities throughout the entire data processing pipeline. Traditional security approaches rely on computational complexity and face challenges in adequately securing sensitive healthcare data against evolving threats, thus necessitating robust solutions that ensure trust, enhance security, and maintain data confidentiality and integrity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a two-phase framework that integrates blockchain technology with IoMT to enhance trust computation, resulting in a secure cluster that supports the quality-of-service (QoS) for sensitive data. The first phase utilizes the decentralized interplanetary file system and hashing functions to create a smart contract for device registration, establishing a resilient storage platform that encrypts data, improves fault tolerance, and facilitates data access. In the second phase, communication overhead is optimized by considering power levels, communication ranges, and computing capabilities alongside the smart contract. The smart contract evaluates the trust index and QoS of each node to facilitate device clustering based on processing capabilities. We implemented the proposed framework using OMNeT++ simulator and C++ programming language and evaluated against the cutting-edge IoMT security approaches in terms of attack detection, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and latency. The qualitative results demonstrated that the proposed framework enhanced attack detection by 6.00%, 18.00%, 20.00%, and 27.00%, reduced energy consumption by 6.91%, 8.19%, 12.07%, and 17.94%, improved packet delivery ratio by 3.00%, 6.00%, 9.00%, and 10.00%, increased throughput by 7.00%, 8.00%, 11.00%, and 13.00%, and decreased latency by 4.90%, 8.81%, 11.54%, and 20.63%, against state-of-the-art methods and was supported by statistical analysis.",

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (212KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "6G is envisioned as the next generation of wireless communication technology, promising unprecedented data speeds, ultra-low Latency, and ubiquitous Connectivity. In tandem with these advancements, blockchain technology is leveraged to enhance computer vision applicationsâ security, trustworthiness, and transparency. With the widespread use of mobile devices equipped with cameras, the ability to capture and recognize Chinese characters in natural scenes has become increasingly important. Blockchain can facilitate privacy-preserving mechanisms in applications where privacy is paramount, such as facial recognition or personal healthcare monitoring. Users can control their visual data and grant or revoke access as needed. Recognizing Chinese characters from images can provide convenience in various aspects of peopleâs lives. However, traditional Chinese character text recognition methods often need higher accuracy, leading to recognition failures or incorrect character identification. In contrast, computer vision technologies have significantly improved image recognition accuracy. This paper proposed a Secure end-to-end recognition system (SE2ERS) for Chinese characters in natural scenes based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) using 6G technology. The proposed SE2ERS model uses the Weighted Hyperbolic Curve Cryptograph (WHCC) of the secure data transmission in the 6G network with the blockchain model. The data transmission within the computer vision system, with a 6G gradient directional histogram (GDH), is employed for character estimation. With the deployment of WHCC and GDH in the constructed SE2ERS model, secure communication is achieved for the data transmission with the 6G network. The proposed SE2ERS compares the performance of traditional Chinese text recognition methods and data transmission environment with 6G communication. Experimental results demonstrate that SE2ERS achieves an average recognition accuracy of 88% for simple Chinese characters, compared to 81.2% with traditional methods. For complex Chinese characters, the average recognition accuracy improves to 84.4% with our system, compared to 72.8% with traditional methods. Additionally, deploying the WHCC model improves data security with the increased data encryption rate complexity of â¼12 & higher than the traditional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe difficulties about user security and privacy have appeared as significant concerns in recent years. The number of cyber-attacks grows at a concerning velocity, hence rendering internet users susceptible to malicious activities perpetrated by hackers. Data mining approaches are employed to extract accurate results from massive and complex databases. Furthermore, the utilization of Blockchain (BC) approaches is increasingly popular in current Internet of Things (IoT) applications as an opportunity to address issues related to privacy and security. Lots of studies have been performed on algorithms for data mining and techniques concerning blockchain. Time series data is a commonly used form of data. Time Series Classification (TSC) refers to the creation of predictive models that generate a target variable or label based on linear or sequential data inputs across a considerable duration. The possible results may be presented in either ordinal or numerical form. Even so, previous studies have shown major limitations when it comes to handling privacy and security issues that canât be applicable in dynamic instances, as well as the substantial computational cost necessary. Moreover, correctly determining the amount of sensitive parameters required to complete the classification process remains a challenge. We have put forth a comprehensive survey on the classification of blockchain data. In the first phase of our study, we conducted an analysis and categorization of both conventional data classification approaches and contemporary time series data classification techniques. We further discussed limitations and strengths of existing techniques. Finally, we highlight future research problems and directions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research study aims to reveal the role of supply chain parameters approved by blockchain technology toward firm performance through trust. This study has also examined the moderating role of government support between trust and firm performance. The underlying theories reinforce the usefulness and flexibility of a supply chain in regulating daily fluctuations and uncertainties in supply and demand. Blockchain technology adoption with supply chain tactics provides a more suitable environment for better firm performance. Governments address legal and security concerns related to blockchain technology and provide clear guidelines and standards for its use in supply chains, which build trust among firms and stakeholders. A conceptual model has been developed with the assistance of past empirical research studies and associated theories. This research study has examined the following relationships from a sample of 465 employees from textile industrial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. The current research study assesses these parameters using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method. The analysis showed that supply chain parameters (alignment, agility, adaptability) approved by blockchain technology positively correlate with firm performance. Trust positively mediated the relationship between supply chain parameters approved by blockchain technology and firm performance. Furthermore, government support positively moderated the relationship between trust and firm performance. The study would provide directions for further research. These findings will give the global supply chain industry valuable insights into blockchain technology for firm performance. In theory, this research study would contribute to the scientific literature by answering how trust and government support affect the overall firm performance.",

Considering the significance and popularity of IoT systems, it can be predicted that the number of users and IoT devices are going to increase exponentially shortly. Therefore, it is extremely important to improve the QoS provided by IoT applications to increase their adaptability. Majority of the IoT systems are characterized by their heterogeneous and diverse nature. It is challenging for these systems to provide high-quality access to all the connecting devices with uninterrupted connectivity. Considering their heterogeneity, it is equally difficult to achieve better QoS parameters. Artificial intelligence-based machine learning (ML) tools are considered a potential tool for improving the QoS parameters in IoT applications. This research proposes a novel approach for enhancing QoS parameters in IoT using ML and Blockchain techniques. The IoT network with Blockchain technology is simulated using an NS2 simulator. Different QoS parameters such as delay, throughput, packet delivery ratio, and packet drop are analyzed. The obtained QoS values are classified using different ML models such as Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Ensemble, learning techniques. Results show that the Ensemble classifier achieves the highest classification accuracy of 83.74 % compared to NB and DT classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEdgeâedge collaboration is the main collaboration mode for edge computing (EC) in time-sensitive networking (TSN). This distributed collaboration mode, in which the computing work is implemented collaboratively by the edge computing nodes (ECNs) without the involvement of cloud servers, poses challenges to collaboration management. However, most existing methods of ECN collaboration only focus on the scheduling of computing resources rather than management process design and rarely consider the transparency, security, and fair distribution guarantee mechanism of collaboration benefits. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based and decentralized management scheme for ECNs autonomous collaboration in TSN. First, we design an edgeâedge collaboration management framework and its workflow based on blockchain for EC in TSN (TECChain), which combines blockchain with TSN technology and EC paradigm. To solve the consensus problem in TECChain, the proof of diligence (PoD) and delegated PoD (DPoD) consensus mechanisms are designed. Furthermore, by leveraging the high-precision synchronous clock foundation of TSN, we propose two time-slot-driven consensus algorithms, named sequential decision-making based on DPoD (S-DPoD) and Byzantine fault tolerance based on DPoD (BFT-DPoD) respectively. Theoretical analysis results show that the proposed algorithms perform better in terms of security, transactions per second (TPS), energy saving, etc., compared to other algorithms. Comparison experiments reveal that S-DPoD consumes fewer interactive messages and has higher Byzantine fault tolerance and success rate of consensus than BFT-DPoD, but BFT-DPoD has lower transaction verification latency and larger TPS.",

    "abstract": "Currently, data security and privacy protection are becoming more and more important. Access control is a method of authorization for users through predefined policies. Token-based access control (TBAC) enhances the manageability of authorization through the token. However, traditional access control policies lack the ability to dynamically adjust based on user access behavior. Incorporating user reputation evaluation into access control can provide valuable feedback to enhance system security and flexibility. As a result, this paper proposes a blockchain-empowered TBAC system and introduces a user reputation evaluation module to provide feedback on access control. The TBAC system divides the access control process into three stages: policy upload, token request, and resource request. The user reputation evaluation module evaluates the userâs token reputation and resource reputation for the token request and resource request stages of the TBAC system. The proposed system is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The TBAC system is evaluated to prove that it has high processing performance. The user reputation evaluation model is proved to be more conservative and sensitive by comparative study with other methods. In addition, the security analysis shows that the TBAC system has a certain anti-attack ability and can maintain stable operation under the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe technological shifts driven by Industry 4.0 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered new challenges for seaports, necessitating a transformation in their information and communications systems to enhance global competitiveness. As the United Nations (UN) International Maritime Organization mandates the adoption of a Maritime Single Window in short time, seaports are compelled to adapt their operations. Addressing these challenges, this research introduces the Dependable Machine Learning for seaports using Blockchain (DMLBC) method, offering a secure technological system that integrates transactional data among various logistics stakeholders. DMLBC enhances efficiency in document control, traceability, loading processes, and collaborative workflows. The method employs a architecture grounded in Blockchain (BC) and harnesses Machine Learning Techniques. In a practical application, DMLBC is implemented in a real case study, demonstrating its efficacy for decision making of port operations. The research discusses the contributions that the DMLBC method has compared to what exists in the bibliographic review and in other port industries worldwide. Describes future exploration directions and It emphasizes the potential for generating additional predictions by incorporating others Key Performance Indicators (KPI)s, integrating DMLBC with Decision Support System (DSS), and delving into the realm of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to fortify the security of seaport operations in the evolving technological landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nChit fund is a peer-to-peer saving and borrowing scheme operated among trusted groups of people. It is a reliable source of funds in emergencies with no guarantor and low-interest rate. Despite their enduring benefits, chit funds face challenges related to trust, transparency, and security. At present, unscrupulous subscribers might join chit-funds, borrow money, and make payment defaults. This leads to disruptions in contribution cycle and affects overall functioning. Additionally, non-transparent record-keeping and transaction processes, hinder participants from verifying fund activities, creating a susceptible environment for fraud and malpractice. These challenges are an obstacle to the sustainability and trustworthiness of the chit-fund system. Therefore, to overcome aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes TruChit, a blockchain-based chit fund system with creditworthiness evaluation framework. It leverages the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to assess the creditworthiness of subscribers, which ensures the credibility and reliability of individual participants. Further, proposes permissioned blockchain-assisted chit-fund framework with role-based access control to instill trust, security, and transparency within chit-fund operations. Moreover, the efficacy of TruChit is evaluated by analyzing credit score dataset and achieves 93.5% accuracy, which is better than other approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has great potential for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling interactive vehicle applications, such as advanced driving and infotainment. It is crucial to ensure the reliability during the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction process. Although the emerging blockchain has superiority in handling security-related issues, existing blockchain-based schemes show weakness in highly dynamic IoV. Both the transaction broadcast and consensus process require multiple rounds of communication throughout the whole network, while the high relative speed between vehicles and dynamic topology resulting in the intermittent connections will degrade the efficiency of blockchain. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled blockchain framework for dynamic IoV, which aims to reduce both the communication cost and the operational latency of blockchain. To address the dynamic context, we propose a DT construction strategy that jointly considers the DT migration and blockchain computing consumption. Moreover, a communication-efficient Local Perceptual Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (LPMA-DDPG) algorithm is designed to execute the DT construction strategy among edge servers in a decentralized manner. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can greatly reduce the communication cost, while achieving good security performance. The dynamic DT construction strategy shows superiority in operation latency compared with benchmark strategies. The decentralized LPMA-DDPG algorithm is helpful for implementing the optimal DT construction strategy in practical ITS.",

This study explores container shipping service providersâ (CSSPs) current adoption status and perceived barriers in integrating blockchain applications before providing adoption recommendations. A qualitative analysis was conducted on thirty-two interviews with experts holding managing positions from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders. Thematic analysis was employed to extract and aggregate information from the qualitative database. This study revealed the difference between CSSPsâ perceptions of blockchain adoption barriers and, accordingly, their adopting approaches. A challenging implementing process for the current blockchain applications in container shipping was depicted with ten barriers and twenty-nine connections. Industry experts provided six recommendations for successful blockchain adoption to address the complicated situation. This paper deepens the knowledge about blockchain in supply chains, especially maritime logistics operations. It sheds light on the complexity of perceived adoption barriers, their effect on CSSPsâ approaches to blockchain applications, and potential digitalization policies to be taken.",

This paper explores the applicability of blockchain technology, and of distributed ledger technologies in general, to urban water supply and sanitation services in Spain. The potential of this technology for improving processes in this sector is assessed through a specific methodology of strategic analysis developed for this purpose. First, the technical, legal and managerial factors that condition the potential use of this technology to address the global, operational and governance challenges faced by urban water management are explored. Second, strategic analysis tools (e.g. value chain, factors of competition, and benchmarking) are used to model a water utility organization as a set of processes and characterize blockchain as an enabling technology with both benefits (traceability, immutability, and disintermediation) and limitations. Based on cost-benefit analysis, use cases in which the implementation of a blockchain could improve the organization's performance can be discerned. The results identify the processes and sub-processes of urban water utility management for which the use of a blockchain could improve performance: comprehensive maintenance, the management of serious incidents, and supplier management. Essentially, the methodology developed identifies management processes whose requirements are efficiently met through automation derived from blockchain solutions. Regardless of the management models currently in place in Spain, the traceability and disintermediation benefits of blockchain solutions can help to overcome governance and efficiency challenges associated with the management of urban water supply and sanitation services.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe application of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies has received increasing attention from industry and scholars alike. Given predicted looming food crises, some of the most impactful deployments of blockchains are likely to concern food supply chains. This study outlined how blockchain adoption can result in positive affordances in the food supply chain. Using Q- methodology, this study explored the current status of the agri-food supply chain and how blockchain technology could be useful in addressing existing challenges. This theorization leads to the proposition of the 3TIC value-driver framework for determining the enabling affordances of blockchain that would increase shared value for stakeholders. First, we propose a framework based on the most promising features of blockchain technology to overcome current challenges in the agri-food industry. Our value-driver framework is driven by the Q-study findings of respondents closely associated with the agri-food supply chain. This framework can provide supply chain stakeholders with a clear perception of blockchain affordances and serve as a guideline for utilizing appropriate features of technology that match organizationsâ capabilities, core competencies, goals, and limitations. Therefore, it could assist top-level decision-makers in systematically evaluating parts of the organization to focus on and improve the infrastructure for successful blockchain implementation along the agri-food supply chain. We conclude by noting certain significant challenges that must be carefully addressed to successfully adopt blockchain technology.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach that seamlessly integrates blockchain and substitution cipher techniques to enhance the security landscape of the metaverse. The proposed approach encompasses the generation of the rule table for substitution encryption and decryption, as well as a methodology for data encryption and decryption utilizing the rule table. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approachâs security robustness, especially focusing on its resistance against potential security attacks, including the brute-force attack. Moreover, a series of performance experiments were meticulously conducted to comprehensively gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique. The findings revealed that the proposed approach outperforms asymmetric key algorithms in terms of encryption elapsed time. Additionally, the decryption process of the proposed approach is notably faster than both symmetric and asymmetric key algorithms. The results of security analysis and performance evaluations underscore the viability and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a promising solution for secure and swift data management within the metaverse environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nProbability distributions are frequently used for statistical modeling of real-life phenomena in every field of life. Most often, real-life data sets are skewed in nature, and therefore, asymmetrical probability distributions are very competent for such scenarios. In the recent gains in distribution theory, researchers are focusing on developing new symmetrical and asymmetrical trigonometric-based probability distributions for data modeling in various fields. In the literature, however, there is no published work on statistical modeling of the transaction confirmation times on blockchain technology using trigonometric-originated probability distributions. For the first time covering the aforesaid research gap, this paper introduces a new trigonometric-based probabilistic approach for modeling the transaction confirmation times on blockchain technology. The new approach is called a new sine-G family of distributions. Using the proposed method, a new probability distribution called a new sine-Weibull distribution is studied. The proposed model is very flexible and obeys the symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes of its density function. The estimators of the new sine-Weibull distribution are derived, and their evaluation is tested through a simulation study. The applicability of the new sine-Weibull distribution is demonstrated by analyzing the average waiting time until the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed on blockchain technology.",

Cyber attacks could harm the power systemâs functioning and cause substantial economic losses. Malicious injection of compromised synchrophasor measurements is capable of hampering adequate control actions and jeopardizing the security and reliability of the power system. To tackle this issue, an adequate method for detecting cyber intrusion in the communication network should be developed for the secure operation of the cyberâphysical power system. Blockchain has evolved as a proven technology that holds the potential for enhancing grid security. In this paper, we investigate the application of blockchain for enhancing grid security and propose a random sequence-based symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a blockchain-based secure platform for sharing the decryption keys. The presence of cyber-attack has been identified using a weighted least square-based state estimator. We have further developed a cyber-attack simulator application that could emulate the behavior of a false data injector and proposed the attack detection mechanism.

With the increasing demand for multimedia visual images, the quality of image analysis is also increasing. However, in image processing and computer vision tasks, protecting users' privacy and preventing data leakage and abuse are not handled well. Image enhancement and nonlinear image color balance algorithm are applied to improve the visual quality of multimedia visual images and make them clearer and fuller. The article utilized image enhancement and a non-linear image color balance algorithm to improve the processing effect before visual image analysis. It also utilized the encryption mechanism of blockchain technology to detect the similarity of multimedia visual images. By comparing the feature points of the images, similar images were matched to address the copyright issue of the images. After experimental testing, the effect of image enhancement is significant, and the histogram of image equalization is significantly better than the original image. In the experiment of image analysis, the computer accurately classified visual images with different attributes. Finally, in the similarity detection algorithm of blockchain, the test results showed that when the number of image transactions reaches 500, the difference hash algorithm takes 1.13 s and 0.78 s to calculate the similarity comparison between the original and secondary images. The differential hash algorithm of blockchain is significantly superior to the Message-Digest Algorithm (MD5) in terms of computational speed and resource consumption. It has better image similarity detection performance and can also provide better image copyright protection mechanisms.",

This includes the decision of blockchain type, the use of digital signature technology to implement responsibility, and the construction of a hybrid blockchain system using the blockchain's consensus mechanism. The paper presents the general design, the design of the system structures, and the design of modules of the system.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFederated learning combines with fog computing to transform data sharing into model sharing, which solves the issues of data isolation and privacy disclosure in fog computing. However, existing studies focus on centralized single-layer aggregation federated learning architecture, which lack the consideration of cross-domain and asynchronous robustness of federated learning, and rarely integrate verification mechanisms from the perspective of incentives. To address the above challenges, we propose a Blockchain and Signcryption enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning (BSAFL) framework based on dual aggregation for asynchronous cross-domain federated learning scenarios. In particular, we first design two types of signcryption schemes to secure the interaction and access control of collaborative learning between domains. Second, we construct a differential privacy approach that adaptively adjusts privacy budgets to ensure data privacy and local models' availability of intra-domain user. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous aggregation solution that incorporates consensus verification and elastic participation using blockchain. Finally, security analysis demonstrates the security and privacy effectiveness of BSAFL, and the evaluation on real datasets further validates the high model accuracy and performance of BSAFL.",

Often E-Commerce companies are accused of manipulating with the data and it suffers from biasing. Biasing leads to wrong customer's view creation thereby prediction for a top rating product fails. This study shows how crowd annotation prevents this biasness and thereby design a smart contract which ultimately will help to eliminate the data manipulation. The smart contract is deployed and tested to see if data can be saved in the run time storage memory regions of the Ethereum blockchain, and the test results are positive. In future this will help to get the unbiased data and better machine learning results, which will ultimately be beneficial for the economy.",

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in vehicle traffic volume in modern societies has raised the need to develop innovative solutions to reduce traffic congestion and enhance traffic management efficiency. Revolutionary advanced technology, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enables improved traffic management, helps eliminate congestion, and supports a safer environment. ITS provides real-time information on vehicle traffic and transportation systems that can improve decision-making for road users. However, ITS suffers from routing issues at the network layer when utilising Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). This is because each vehicle plays the role of a router in this network, which leads to a complex vehicle communication network, causing issues such as repeated link breakages between vehicles resulting from the mobility of the network and rapid topological variation. This may lead to loss or delay in packet transmissions; this weakness can be exploited in routing attacks, such as black-hole and gray-hole attacks, that threaten the availability of ITS services. In this paper, a Blockchain-based smart contracts model is proposed to offer convenient and comprehensive security mechanisms, enhancing the trustworthiness between vehicles. Self-Classification Blockchain-Based Contracts (SCBC) and Voting-Classification Blockchain-Based Contracts (VCBC) are utilised in the proposed protocol. The results show that VCBC succeeds in attaining better results in PDR and TP performance even in the presence of Blackhole and Grayhole attacks.",

    "abstract": "The concept of smart houses has grown in prominence in recent years. Major challenges linked to smart homes are identification theft, data safety, automated decision-making for IoT-based devices, and the security of the device itself. Current home automation systems try to address these issues but there is still an urgent need for a dependable and secure smart home solution that includes automatic decision-making systems and methodical features. This paper proposes a smart home system based on ensemble learning of random forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for programmed decision-making tasks, such as categorizing gadgets as âOFFâ or âONâ based on their normal routine in homes. We have integrated emerging blockchain technology to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy authentication and recognition of IoT devices. Our system consists of a 5V relay circuit, various sensors, and a Raspberry Pi server and database for managing devices. We have also developed an Android app that communicates with the server interface through an HTTP web interface and an Apache server. The feasibility and efficacy of the proposed smart home automation system have been evaluated in both laboratory and real-time settings. It is essential to use inexpensive, scalable, and readily available components and technologies in smart home automation systems. Additionally, we must incorporate a comprehensive security and privacy-centric design that emphasizes risk assessments, such as cyberattacks, hardware security, and other cyber threats. The trial results support the proposed system and demonstrate its potential for use in everyday life.",

This article introduces DA2Wa, a protocol designed to establish a secure pairing between a cryptocurrency wallet and a DApp, both of which run as isolated applications on the same machine. The protocol utilizes a six-character PIN exchange mechanism, delivering a security level equivalent to that of Bluetooth. To demonstrate the security of DA2Wa, we employ Tamarin Prover, a tool for symbolically modelling and analysing security protocols.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIntrusion detection in the Internet of Things (IoTs) is a vital unit of IoT safety. IoT devices face diverse kinds of attacks, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a significant role in detecting and responding to these threats. A typical IDS solution can be utilized from the IoT networks for monitoring traffic, device behaviour, and system logs for signs of intrusion or abnormal movement. Deep learning (DL) approaches are exposed to promise in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of IDS for IoT devices. Blockchain (BC) aided intrusion detection from IoT platforms provides many benefits, including better data integrity, transparency, and resistance to tampering. This paper projects a novel sandpiper optimizer with hybrid deep learning-based intrusion detection (SPOHDL-ID) from the BC-assisted IoT platform. The key contribution of the SPOHDL-ID model is to accomplish security via the intrusion detection and classification process from the IoT platform. In this case, the BC technology can be used for a secure data-sharing process. In the presented SPOHDL-ID technique, the selection of features from the network traffic data takes place using the SPO model. Besides, the SPOHDL-ID technique employs the HDL model for intrusion detection, which involves the design of a convolutional neural network with a stacked autoencoder (CNN-SAE) model. The beetle search optimizer algorithm (BSOA) method is used for the hyperparameter tuning procedure to increase the recognition outcomes of the CNN-SAE technique. An extensive simulation outcome is created to exhibit a better solution to the SPOHDL-ID method. The experimental validation of the SPOHDL-ID method portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.59â¯% and 99.54â¯% over recent techniques under the ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets.",

    "abstract": "Background\nBlockchain has been proposed as a critical technology to facilitate more patient-centric research and health information sharing. For instance, it can be applied to coordinate and document dynamic informed consent, a procedure that allows individuals to continuously review and renew their consent to the collection, use, or sharing of their private health information. Such has been suggested to facilitate ethical, compliant longitudinal research, and patient engagement. However, blockchain-based dynamic consent is a relatively new concept, and it is not yet clear how well the suggested implementations will work in practice. Efforts to critically evaluate implementations in health research contexts are limited.\nObjective\nThe objective of this protocol is to guide the identification and critical appraisal of implementations of blockchain-based dynamic consent in health research contexts, thereby facilitating the development of best practices for future research, innovation, and implementation.\nMethods\nThe protocol describes methods for an integrative review to allow evaluation of a broad range of quantitative and qualitative research designs. The PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) framework guided the reviewâs structure and nature of reporting findings. We developed search strategies and syntax with the help of an academic librarian. Multiple databases were selected to identify pertinent academic literature (CINAHL, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and gray literature (Electronic Theses Online Service, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Open Access Theses and Dissertations, and Google Scholar) for a comprehensive picture of the fieldâs progress. Eligibility criteria were defined based on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) requirements and a criteria framework for technology readiness. A total of 2 reviewers will independently review and extract data, while a third reviewer will adjudicate discrepancies. Quality appraisal of articles and discussed implementations will proceed based on the validated Mixed Method Appraisal Tool, and themes will be identified through thematic data synthesis.\nResults\nLiterature searches were conducted, and after duplicates were removed, 492 articles were eligible for screening. Title and abstract screening allowed the removal of 312 articles, leaving 180 eligible articles for full-text review against inclusion criteria and confirming a sufficient body of literature for project feasibility. Results will synthesize the quality of evidence on blockchain-based dynamic consent for patient-centric research and health information sharing, covering effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, regulatory compliance, and methods of managing identity.\nConclusions\nThe review will provide a comprehensive picture of the progress of emerging blockchain-based dynamic consent technologies and the rigor with which implementations are approached. Resulting insights are expected to inform best practices for future research, innovation, and implementation to benefit patient-centric research and health information sharing.\nTrial Registration\nPROSPERO CRD42023396983; http://tinyurl.com/cn8a5x7t\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nDERR1-10.2196/50339",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\n\"Developed a real-time analysis and prediction framework for dynamic supply chain operations, integrating IoT, BIM, and blockchain technology.\"\nâ¢\n\"Created a supply chain management model (SCMM-PDO) integrating physical, digital, and operational layers in a robust system architecture.\"\nâ¢\n\"Addressed information traceability and reliability challenges in offsite manufacturing supply chain with a new framework.\"\nâ¢\n\"Combined IoT, BIM, and blockchain for improved efficiency and transparency in supply chain management.\"\nâ¢\n\"Highlight potential improvements and trust across supply chain activities through IoT, BIM, and blockchain integration.\"\nAbstract\nThe transformation of dynamic supply chains within the realm of offsite manufacturing presents a unique and compelling opportunity to effectively respond to shifts in market demand. However, this paradigm shift also entails novel challenges and prospects for streamlining processes, augmenting efficiency, and ultimately driving success across production workflows and logistical operations. Dynamic supply chains necessitate unimpeded access to high-quality, dependable data to facilitate real-time, data-driven decision-making. Furthermore, owing to their inherently intricate nature, these supply chains are subject to a heightened vulnerability to disruptions and delays, surpassing those encountered in traditional supply chains. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes a framework that synthesises the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), Building Information Modelling (BIM), and blockchain technology (BCT) into a cohesive and integrated system, thereby optimising the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management operations. The proposed framework takes cognisance of the challenges inherent in ensuring information traceability, mitigating fragmented information, enhancing interoperability, and fortifying reliability throughout the design, production, and implementation phases of assets within dynamic supply chains operating in the offsite manufacturing domain. To illustrate the efficacy of our proposition, we present a framework that exemplifies the seamless integration of a permissioned, open-source distributed ledger, which forms the bedrock of our support infrastructure for IoT and BIM integration.\nThrough rigorous analysis, we showcase the effectiveness of the developed framework in the form of a designed Supply Chain Management Model (SCMM-PDO), which harmonises the physical, digital, and operational layers within a robust system architecture (BCT.IoT-BIM). The integration of these technologies provides a decentralised solution, reinforcing supply chains with improved security, reliability, and quality control mechanisms, thus enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain network. It is anticipated that this transformative integration will yield substantial improvements in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as operational efficiency, cost reduction, and the cultivation of trust and accountability across supply chain activities.\nThe research proposes an IoT and BIM conceptual framework that simulates the dynamic supply chain operations, facilitating real-time analysis and prediction of supply chain participants' behaviours from resources, processes, and assets. Furthermore, the integration of IoT-BIM (digital twinning) with a blockchain-based system, such as Hyperledger Fabric, engenders a secure and transparent framework for the diligent tracking of assets and information throughout the supply chain. The findings of this study offer an all-encompassing conceptual framework for the secure and transparent tracking of asset information by integrating Blockchain-based technologies with IoT and BIM. This research endeavour thus expands the existing body of knowledge, establishing a foundation for future investigations within this proliferating field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the realm of modern healthcare, Electronic Health Records EHR serve as invaluable assets, yet they also pose significant security challenges. The absence of EHR access auditing mechanisms, which includes the EHR audit trails, results in accountability gaps and magnifies security vulnerabilities. This situation effectively paves the way for unauthorized data alterations to occur without detection or consequences. Inadequate EHR compliance auditing procedures, particularly in verifying and validating access control policies, expose healthcare organizations to risks such as data breaches, and unauthorized data usage. These vulnerabilities result from unchecked unauthorized access activities. Additionally, the absence of EHR audit logs complicates investigations, weakens proactive security measures, and raises concerns to put healthcare institutions at risk. This study addresses the pressing need for robust EHR auditing systems designed to scrutinize access to EHR data, encompassing who accesses it, when, and for what purpose. Our research delves into the complex field of EHR auditing, which includes establishing an immutable audit trail to enhance data security through blockchain technology. We also integrate Purpose-Based Access Control (PBAC) alongside smart contracts to strengthen compliance auditing by validating access legitimacy and reducing unauthorized entries. Our contributions encompass the creation of audit trail of EHR access, compliance auditing via PBAC policy verification, the generation of audit logs, and the derivation of data-driven insights, fortifying EHR access security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) contribute to strengthening the global market by creating new jobs. Interactions among these companies may indeed be facilitated via e-commerce platforms. However, e-commerce activities seem to be a virtual face-to-face transactions, highly digital, and mutable. E-commerce based SMEs are frequently exposed to virtuous risks and competitive intensity. Blockchain is a digital database with the features of truthfulness, assurance, accountability, and intractability. It is made up of decentralized data storage, a consensus algorithm, and smart contracts. As a result, integrating e-commerce platforms and blockchain networks to help SMEs overcome their security difficulties. Conventional e-commerce platforms and storage depends on authorized intermediary networks or distributed cloud storage. Still, the failure of a single device is a danger, and third parties access, and data storage systems might be subject to data theft attacks. This paper presents a proof-of-authority (PoA) based consensus mechanism for e-commerce platforms in SMEs to address security issues in the network. This manuscript initially developed an energy-efficient PoA based consensus mechanism supported by e-commerce platforms for SMEs. We construct a comprehensive PoA consensus model based on pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) and accumulated validators number (AVN) for adding a new block in the conceptual framework. Finally, we demonstrate the security performance of the proposed consensus mechanism to help SMEs solve finance and trading issues. To evaluate the energy performance of the proposed model, we did a CPU utilization analysis and compared it with existing consensus protocols.",

At the same time, in Spain, the adoption of new technologies for the digitization of the agri-food sector has been proposed as a solution to address structural issues such as lack of competitiveness and innovation. In fact, systems using blockchain-related technologies for food control and traceability have seen great progress in recent years and, currently, the use of blockchain in supply chain management is almost doubling year on year. In this context, this paper investigates the level of development of blockchain technology in the agri-food sector in Spain and its applications for certifying food production conditions within the supply chain, and how it is supported by public policies. It identifies several challenges that need to be addressed for a widespread adoption could take place, such as data recorded on the blockchain, lack of standards, limited scope of projects, and integration of data capture automatically or with other technologies like RFID and AI. The document proposes to reorient public development policies to address these challenges, such as reusing data from, already in place, European data collections for production control and food traceability, educating users and stakeholders about the use of blockchain technology, and fostering legal and technical provisions which ensure system transparency to facilitate a successful implementation of blockchain.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of quantum technology poses significant security risks to blockchain systems. However, quantum technology can also provide solutions for enhancing blockchain security. In this paper, we propose a quantum-enhanced blockchain scheme to achieve a high level of security against quantum computing attacks. We first discuss quantum computing attacks on classic blockchains, including attacks on hash functions, digital signatures, and consensus mechanisms. We then introduce quantum technologies, such as a quantum hash function (QHF), a quantum digital signature (QDS), and proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, into our scheme to improve the security of the blockchain system. Our security analysis demonstrates that our scheme offers superior security against quantum and classic attacks. Finally, we compare our scheme with previous works, showing that our scheme has achieved a perfect balance in terms of practicality, reliability, scalability, and efficiency. Overall, this work contributes to the ongoing research on quantum blockchain in the quantum era.",

It pays particular attention to industry-based analyses and options presented by cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and digital currencies for the credit supply and financial stability. A positivistic or quantitative research design is employed. The method of data collection is a survey-based questionnaire, as well as the time interval data method, from December 2021 to December 2022. The study sample comprises of five industrial zones of Punjab. The respondents are businessmen, managers, and employees (N = 449). The study finds that the use of various digital currencies quickly transforms business. The study shows that most industries do not require central banks and, instead, concentrate on modern digital currency and blockchain systems for monetary transfers. The private and public models of physical money will likely fail in the future. Rather, central banks should adopt digital currency and blockchain with an online technological payment strategy in order to enhance domestic financial stability and payment systems.",

    "abstract": "System-wide information management (SWIM) is a complex distributed information transfer and sharing system for the next generation of Air Transportation System (ATS). In response to the growing volume of civil aviation air operations, users accessing different authentication domains in the SWIM system have problems with the validity, security, and privacy of SWIM-shared data. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a SWIM cross-domain authentication scheme based on a consistent hashing algorithm on consortium blockchain and designs a blockchain certificate format for SWIM cross-domain authentication. The scheme uses a consistent hash algorithm with virtual nodes in combination with a cluster of authentication centers in the SWIM consortium blockchain architecture to synchronize the userâs authentication mapping relationships between authentication domains. The virtual authentication nodes are mapped separately using different services provided by SWIM to guarantee the partitioning of the consistent hash ring on the consortium blockchain. According to the dynamic change of userâs authentication requests, the nodes of virtual service authentication can be added and deleted to realize the dynamic load balancing of cross-domain authentication of different services. Security analysis shows that this protocol can resist network attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, and Sybil attacks. Experiments show that this scheme can reduce the redundant authentication operations of identity information and solve the problems of traditional cross-domain authentication with single-point collapse, difficulty in expansion, and uneven load. At the same time, it has better security of information storage and can realize the cross-domain authentication requirements of SWIM users with low communication costs and system overhead.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in demand for data trustworthiness and data security, distributed data storage technology represented by blockchain has received unprecedented attention. These technologies have been suggested for various uses because of their remarkable ability to offer decentralization, high autonomy, full process traceability, and tamper resistance. Blockchain enables the exchange of information and value in an untrusted environment. There has been a significant increase in attention to the confidentiality and privacy preservation of blockchain technology. Ensuring data privacy is a critical concern in cryptography, and one of the most important protocols used to achieve this is the secret-sharing method. By dividing the secret into shares and distributing them among multiple parties, no one can access the secret without the cooperation of the other parties. However, Attackers with quantum computers in the future can execute Groverâs and Shorâs algorithms on quantum computers that can break or reduce the currently widely used cryptosystems. Furthermore, centralized management of keys increases the risk of key leakage. This paper proposed a post-quantum threshold algorithm to reduce the risk of data privacy leakage in blockchain Systems. This algorithm uses distributed key management technology to reduce the risk of individual node private key leakage and provide post-quantum security. The proposed privacy-preserving cryptographic algorithm provides a post-quantum threshold architecture for managing data, which involves defining users and interaction processes within the system. This paper applies a linear secret-sharing solution to partition the private key of the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) algorithm into n parts. It constructs a tân threshold that allows recovery of the plaintext only when more than t nodes participate in decryption. The characteristic of a threshold makes the scheme resistant to collusion attacks from members whose combined credibility is less than the threshold. This mitigates the risk of single-point private key leakage. During the threshold decryption process, the private key information of the nodes will not be leaked. In addition, the fact that the threshold algorithm is founded on the NTRU lattice enables it to withstand quantum attacks, thus enhancing its security. According to the analysis, the proposed scheme provides superior protection compared to currently available methods. This paper provides post-quantum security solutions for data security protection of blockchain, which will enrich the use of blockchain in scenarios with strict requirements for data privacy protection.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is an important distributed model training technique in Internet of Things (IoT), in which participant selection is a key component that plays a role in improving training efficiency and model accuracy. This module enables a central server to select a subset of participants to perform model training based on data and device information. By doing so, selected participants are rewarded and actively perform model training, while participants that are detrimental to training efficiency and model accuracy are excluded. However, in practice, participants may suspect that the central server may have miscalculated and thus not made the selection honestly. This lack of trustworthiness problem, which can demotivate participants, has received little attention. Another problem that has received little attention is the leakage of participantsâ private information during the selection process. We will therefore propose a federated learning framework with auditable participant selection. It supports smart contracts in selecting a set of suitable participants based on their training loss without compromising the privacy. Considering the possibility of malicious campaigning and impersonation of participants, the framework employs commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs to counteract these malicious behaviors. Finally, we analyze the security of the framework and conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate that the framework can effectively improve the efficiency of federated learning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research investigates the intricate relationships between Environmental Management Control Systems (EMCS), Blockchain Adoption (BCHA), Cleaner Production (CLPR), Product Efficiency (PROD), Environmental Reputation (ENRE), and Environmental Performance (ENPE) within organizational contexts in Indonesia. The study aims to shed light on the role of technology adoption, sustainability practices, and reputation management in shaping environmental outcomes. Methodologically, the research employs a quantitative approach, utilizing survey data from diverse organizations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyzes the data and tests the hypothesized relationships. The findings reveal significant positive relationships between EMCS and BCHA, EMCS and CLPR, EMCS and PROD, BCHA and CLPR, BCHA and PROD, and BCHA and ENRE. Cleaner Production demonstrates a substantial positive impact on both ENRE and ENPE. Product Efficiency influences ENRE positively. However, the direct influence of PROD on ENPE is found to be inconclusive. The study contributes to understanding sustainability dynamics by highlighting the pivotal roles of EMCS, BCHA, CLPR, and PROD in driving environmental reputation and performance within organizations. Furthermore, it underscores the significance of aligning perceived reputation with tangible environmental commitment. Limitations include potential data constraints and the challenge of establishing causality due to the study's correlational nature. Future research is encouraged to explore diverse contexts, conduct in-depth case studies, and investigate moderating variables. This research offers novel insights into the complex interplay between technology adoption, sustainability practices, reputation management, and environmental outcomes, providing valuable guidance for organizations striving to navigate the sustainability landscape in an era of heightened environmental awareness.",

This research presents a novel Renewable Energy Trading Platform (RETP) that leverages blockchain technology to enable secure and decentralized energy trading. The platform utilizes distributed ledger technology to record and verify energy transactions, ensuring transparency and immutability. Smart contracts are employed to automate trade execution and settlement, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. The RETP integrates renewable energy data from various sources, such as smart meters and IoT devices, to enable accurate tracking and verification of energy production and consumption. Through the implementation of the RETP, energy producers can directly sell excess renewable energy to consumers, promoting the adoption of green energy and enhancing energy grid efficiency. A comprehensive evaluation of the platform demonstrates its efficiency, scalability, and security. The proposed RETP has the potential to revolutionize the renewable energy market by fostering peer-to-peer energy trading, empowering energy communities, and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nE-coupons have gradually gained attention with the development of the e-commerce market. The traditional e-coupon system is based on a centralized organization with problems, such as a single point of failure and e-coupon counterfeiting. Blockchain possesses characteristics such as decentralization that can enhance traditional e-coupon systems. In this study, we designed an e-coupon system based on blockchain called Ecoupon-Chain. First, we defined the mini-block, designed the account, block, and transaction structure, and built the system model. Second, we proposed a simple and efficient consensus protocol called Proof of Activeness to improve the systemâs throughput and encourage nodes to perform transactions. Finally, we built a prototype of this e-coupon system and conducted security analysis and experimental evaluation on the prototype. The results show that the system can resist typical attacks, such as fork, double spending, replay, and Sybil attacks. The system throughput can be maintained above 1000 transactions per second under specific circumstances. The efficiency of the system is significantly improved compared to that of the existing consensus protocol. We present a simplified prototype of Ecoupon-Chain at https://github.com/YangYi215613/Ecoupon-Chain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFossil fuel pollution has contributed to dramatic changes in the Earthâs climate, and this trend will continue as fossil fuels are burned at an ever-increasing rate. Many countries around the world are currently making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and one of the methods is the Tradable White Certificate (TWC) mechanism. The mechanism allows organizations to reduce their energy consumption to generate energy savings certificates, and those that achieve greater energy savings can sell their certificates to those that fall short. However, there are some challenges to implementing this mechanism, such as the centralized and costly verification and control of energy savings. Moreover, the verification process is not transparent, which could lead to fraud or manipulation of the system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based TWC mechanism to automatically create, verify, and audit the TWC certificates. In addition, we propose a smart-contract-based TWC trading mechanism that enables traders to trade their TWCs without exposing their private information in an untrusted environment. Evaluations show that the proposed TWC framework is scalable for 1000 TWC traders simultaneously, and optimization problem can be solved in less than 120ms. Moreover, it has been shown that Polygon Matic incurs least gas cost compared to other blockchain-based solutions.",

While existing centralized data marketplaces facilitate data trading, they are often marred by trust issues, a single point of failure, and significant security and privacy vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical shortcomings, this paper introduces a blockchain-based industrial data trading system that not only ensures secure and transparent data trading but also offers advantages over conventional systems. Unlike traditional marketplaces, our proposed system emphasizes trustworthiness by mitigating third-party risks, enhancing data integrity through decentralized storage, and employing graph technology for efficient blockchain querying. Further, with integrated access control, our system elevates security standards. Preliminary evaluations reveal the systemâs potential to offer a more secure, transparent, auditable, and trustworthy data trading environment, distinctly outpacing the capabilities of current marketplaces.",

The protocol introduces a mechanism for users to reveal certain properties of their transaction without having to reveal the transaction itself. The core concept involves allowing users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction history. This is achieved by proving membership in custom association sets, which are designed to demonstrate compliance with regulatory frameworks or social consensus. We illustrate how this mechanism can create a separating equilibrium between compliant and non-compliant withdrawals. Our work describes the technical underpinnings, incentives, and broader implications of this mechanism, highlighting how Privacy Pools-like protocols can create more private yet compliant blockchain transactions.",

However, concerns regarding performance and implementation limitations persist. To demonstrate the challenges regarding the performance and efficiency of blockchain in logistics use cases, this study presents a proof-of-concept model by leveraging the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network to emulate the shipping logistics process and illustrate the automated and self-executing nature of smart contracts and transactions among various logistics participants by implementing RAFT consensus mechanism. Utilizing Hyperledger Caliper, this study evaluates the performance by systematically adjusting parameters including the number of clients, the number of concurrent transactions, and transaction rates per second. Then nuanced variations in latency, send rate, and throughput are examined. Preliminary findings indicate significant performance impacts related to client numbers and transaction rates per second. When exceeding the processing capacity, the average latency of transactions experiences an exponential increase due to limited resources. Furthermore, different types of operations are compared, with Read operations exhibiting the lowest latency and Update operations displaying the highest latency due to the complex computations and validations involved. Lastly, the latency measures of the LogisticChain network between fixed-rate and linear-rate controllers are compared, highlighting lower latency with fixed-rate controllers. This research contributes to the advancement of knowledge in this field by developing open-source codes specifically tailored for maritime logistics use cases.",

However, technology selection can be challenging, especially for multi-party workflows across different geographical boundaries. The chosen technologies must satisfy the requirements of the tasks at hand and align with international and local laws and regulations. Marine bunkering is a global industry comprising multiple stakeholders with diverse roles and responsibilities that must adhere to global standards and regulations. Through a single case study, we endeavor to understand the role of blockchain technology in marine bunkering, drawing on the Task-Technology Fit theory and Group Support System model to investigate this concept. Our analysis reveals that fit depends on underlying legal norms, task characteristics, and technological properties. Furthermore, we shed light on the blockchain framework used and the role of smart contracts in the value chain. Our research offers insights into an extended Task-Technology Fit theory where stakeholders in a value chain are distributed across multiple geographical boundaries.",

    "abstract": "With the application and development of blockchain technology, many problems faced by blockchain traceability are gradually exposed. Such as cross-chain information collaboration, data separation and storage, multi-system, multi-security domain collaboration, etc. To solve these problems, it is proposed to construct trust domains based on federated chains. The public chain is used as the authorization chain to build a cross-domain data traceability mechanism applicable to multi-domain collaboration. First, the architecture of the blockchain cross-domain model is designed. Combined with the data access strategy and the decision mechanism, the open and transparent judgment of cross-domain permission and cross-domain identity authentication is realized. And the public chain consensus node election mechanism is realized based on PageRank. Then, according to the characteristics of a nonsingle chain structure in the process of data flow, a data retrieval mechanism based on a Bloom filter is designed, and the cross-domain traceability algorithm is given. Finally, the safety and effectiveness of the traceability mechanism are verified by security evaluation and performance analysis.",

This paper defines a model, a graphical domain specific language, and a set of tools aimed at helping supply chain domain experts to create blockchain based tracing systems for their supply chains. Starting from a graphical representation of the supply chain, the solidity smart contracts implementing the related tracing system are automatically generated by our framework. Small interventions of programmers are required to customize and finalize such smart contracts. A set of web based interfaces to interact with such smart contracts are also automatically generated. We are confident that our results will increase blockchain usage for supply chain traceability thanks to the automatic process of smart contract generation.",

Compared with the effect of ESG information disclosure practice in western countries, ESG information disclosure practice in China is facing great challenges. Due to the inconsistency of the disclosure forms and disclosure standards of ESG information, the phenomenon of ESG information greenwashing cannot be effectively suppressed. From the perspective of ESG information collection, integration and verification, this paper analyzes the key factors restricting the quality of ESG information disclosure. The distributed accounting technology, across-chain interaction technology, and the characteristics such as imtamability and traceability of the Blockchain can effectively deal with the above constraints. By establishing a private chain within the enterprise, which is interacting with multiple external alliance chains, the enterprises can improve the quality of ESG information disclosure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research paper provides a cross-institutional analysis of design trends, enablers, and challenges in blockchain-enabled cash and voucher delivery in humanitarian programs. The study examines six pilot projects led by three prominent international NGOs across four countries to identify obstacles to innovation, adoption, and scalability that may arise in this context. The research applies human-centered design theory, combined with the multiple case study method, to generate a cross-case synthesis, revealing common threads, specific trends, key reflections, angles of analysis, and design approaches that can facilitate this work in the future. The findings and conclusions from this study aim to be useful and relevant to practitioners, private sector actors, and researchers. The research aims to address existing research gaps and promote a more informed, coordinated, responsible, and rigorous research agenda and community of practice for the use of blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector. Throughout the discussion, this study highlights the frictions related to variables such as context, agency, and participation. A framework for analysis, focused on four key variables: process, people, program and product, is proposed to provide a basis for comparative analysis, and eventually, a series of propositions for interested stakeholders. The study concludes that blockchain technology has the potential to address cost and time inefficiencies in cash and voucher assistance, but success of implementation is highly dependent on design, context, and stakeholder engagement. The paper recommends continued research in this area to further validate findings and expand the use of blockchain technology in humanitarian and development programs. It also emphasizes the significance of integrating these variables into novel approaches to uphold ethical and professional standards in humanitarian work.",

This study used Hyperledger Fabric to develop a Blockchain network for a secured and validated system for issuing, distributing, and sharing digital credentials. For the initial prototype, the network was tested on two use cases: national identification system and academic credentials. Chaincodes were developed for each type of digital credential and deployed into designated Channels in the network. Initial results show that a Blockchain-based system using the Hyperledger Fabric framework is feasible for developing a secure digital credential platform. The current architecture can support the implementation of the initial use cases and can also accommodate the addition of new use cases in the future. The current iteration of our work provides the groundwork for developing a production-level ready platform. Future work for this study includes the development of the end-user web application where users can interact with the network and initiate transactions. The deployment of the Blockchain network may pave the way toward decentralized e-Participatory governance.",

The suggested model explains how usersâ perceptions of specific features of such concepts influence acceptance in ways that existing theories like TPB, TAM, or UTAUT cannot. The results revealed that user empowerment was the most significant factor influencing acceptance. Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance. The findings imply that stakeholders should balance technicality and behavioural aspects, and be aware of the context.",

Traditional data management approaches often involve decentralized data storage that is vulnerable to tampering, making it challenging to conduct multi-party collaborative learning under privacy protection conditions and fully leverage the value of data. Moreover, data with compromised integrity can lead to incorrect results if used for model training. Therefore, this paper aims to break down data sharing barriers and fully utilize decentralized data for multi-party collaborative learning under privacy protection conditions. We propose a trustworthy engine data management method based on blockchain technology to ensure data immutability and non-repudiation. To address the issue of limited data samples for some users resulting in poor model performance, we introduce swarm learning techniques based on centralized machine learning and design a trustworthy data management method for swarm learning, achieving trustworthy regulation of the entire process. We conduct research on engine models under swarm learning based on the NASA open dataset, effectively organizing decentralized data samples for collaborative training while ensuring data privacy and fully leveraging the value of data.",

This study investigates the impact of 2022 World Cup matches on the dynamic performance of each team's fan token. The event study uncovers fan token returns surged six months before the World Cup, driven by positive anticipation effects. However, intraday analysis reveals a reversal of fan token returns consistently declining and trading volumes rising as matches unfold. To explain findings, we uncover asymmetries whereby defeats in high-stake matches caused a plunge in fan token returns, compared to low-stake matches, intensifying in magnitude for knockout matches. Contrarily, victories enhance trading volumes, reflecting increased market activity without a corresponding positive effect on returns. We align findings with the classic market adage \"buy the rumor, sell the news,\" unveiling cognitive biases and nuances in investor sentiment, cautioning the dichotomy of pre-event optimism and subsequent performance declines.\nGraphical Abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (458KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the development of smart agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) projects, the need for extensive collaboration among agricultural devices from different domains has surged, necessitating the authentication of device identities for secure communication. Existing centralized architecture-dependent authentication mechanisms encounter issues like a sole point of failure and inefficiencies. Most authentication schemes are unable to support plentiful devices synchronously connecting to numerous data servers in other domains. To address these problems, we propose a many-to-many cross-domain authentication scheme based on the hybrid blockchain architecture for smart agriculture IoT networks. The scheme enables multiple devices simultaneously executing mutual authentication with several data service providers from other agricultural systems. This paper designs a groupable batch verification (GBV) algorithm that dynamically adjusts the batch size by performing group verification for a list of requests, enhancing the flexibility of cross-domain batch authentication. Furthermore, the proposed scheme provides a pseudonym update mechanism to protect the privacy of devices and guards services of different domains from illegal access by tracking malicious devices. The security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior security features and performance.",

    "abstract": "In the education archive sharing system, when performing homomorphic ciphertext retrieval on the storage server, there are problems such as low security of shared data, confusing parameter management, and weak access control. This paper proposes an Education Archives Sharing and Access Control (EduASAC) system to solve these problems. The system research goal is to realize the sharing of security parameters, the execution of access control, and the recording of system behaviors based on the blockchain network, ensuring the legitimacy of shared membership and the security of education archives. At the same time, the system can be combined with most homomorphic ciphertext retrieval schemes running on the storage server, making the homomorphic ciphertext retrieval mechanism controllable. This paper focuses on the blockchain access control framework and specifically designs smart contracts that conform to the business logic of the EduASAC system. The former adopts a dual-mode access control mechanism combining Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and improves the tagging mode after user permission verification based on the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) authorization framework of Open Authorization (OAuth) 2.0; the latter is used in the system to vote on nodes to join requests, define access control policies, execute permission verification processes, store, and share system parameters, and standardize the behavior of member nodes. Finally, the EduASAC system realizes the encryption, storage, retrieval, sharing, and access control processes of education archives. To verify the performance of the system, simulation experiments were conducted. The results show that the EduASAC system can meet the high security needs of education archive sharing and ensure the systemâs high throughput, low latency, fast decision-making, and fine-grained access control ability.",

    "abstract": "The trusted sharing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can realize the efficient use of medical data resources. Generally speaking, EHRs are widely used in blockchain-based medical data platforms. EHRs are valuable private assets of patients, and the ownership belongs to patients. While recent research has shown that patients can freely and effectively delete the EHRs stored in hospitals, it does not address the challenge of record sharing when patients revisit doctors. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a deletion and recovery scheme of EHRs based on Medical Certificate Blockchain. This paper uses cross-chain technology to connect the Medical Certificate Blockchain and the Hospital Blockchain to realize the recovery of deleted EHRs. At the same time, this paper uses the Medical Certificate Blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store Personal Health Records, which are generated by patients visiting different medical institutions. In addition, this paper also combines digital watermarking technology to ensure the authenticity of the restored electronic medical records. Under the combined effect of blockchain technology and digital watermarking, our proposal will not be affected by any other rights throughout the process. System analysis and security analysis illustrate the completeness and feasibility of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMedicine counterfeiting has raised significant concern in recent years. Falsified and counterfeit drug production and distribution are illegal and a public health concern. The intensity of this problem varies significantly among different countries, depending on how strongly a countryâs laws and procedures are followed. Preventing counterfeit medicines has thus become a critical concern, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries. This research aims, firstly, to outline the possible factors of medicine counterfeiting; secondly, to propose a blockchain-based framework to prevent medicine counterfeiting; and thirdly, to evaluate the proposed framework. A content analysis and a semi-structured interview with the key personnel related to the medicine manufacturing and distribution system in Bangladesh were carried out to derive the current scenario of medicine counterfeit. Based on the interviews and content analysis, a set of use cases for preventing medicine counterfeiting in the context of Bangladesh was explored. The required features for developing a digital solution were extracted considering the derived use cases. A blockchain-based framework for preventing medicine counterfeit was proposed by adopting the extracted features. A prototype was developed based on the proposed framework, and an evaluation study was performed to evaluate the prototype. The evaluation study showed that the average block execution time is 201 ms, and the average block time is 482 ms. Again, the proposed framework was found secure, scalable, customer-oriented, and practical compared to other systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSince the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism can avoid the performance bottleneck of blockchain systems caused by Proof of Work (PoW), it has been widely used in many scenarios. However, in the blockchain system, each node is required to back up all transactions and block data of the system, which will waste a lot of storage resources. It is difficult to apply to scenarios with limited storage resources such as unmanned aerial vehicle networks and smart security protection; thus, it is often used in small-scale networks. In order to deploy PBFT-based blockchain systems in large-scale network scenarios, we propose an ultra-low storage overhead PBFT consensus (ULS-PBFT), which groups nodes hierarchically to limit the storage overhead within the group. In this paper, we first propose an optimal double-layer PBFT consensus from the perspective of minimizing the storage overhead, and prove that this consensus can significantly reduce the storage overhead. In addition, we also investigate the superiority of ULS-PBFT in terms of communication overhead while setting the security threshold in the presence of the possibility of Byzantine nodes. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of ULS-PBFT. Then, we extend such grouping idea to the blockchain system with X-layer PBFT and analyze its storage and communication overhead. Finally, the node grouping strategy of double-layer PBFT is studied for four application scenarios when the performance of storage overhead, communication overhead, and security are considered comprehensively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe subject of this article is an analysis of the hackathon concept as an educational approach and its role in the development of students' knowledge and skills. The goal is to conduct an in-depth examination of the effectiveness and achievements of the hackathon, with special reference to the attitudes of students and teachers involved in this educational methodology. The key emphasis is placed on participants' perception of the possibilities of hackathons providing long-term results and hackathons' impact as an educational format. Through a specific blockchain hackathon jointly organized by the University of Belgrade, Serbia, and the University of Florida, USA, the research examines participants' perspectives and their expectations, experiences, and overall impressions. The research focuses on the readiness of hackathon participants to incorporate new technical skills through this form of learning, knowledge acquisition, attitudes, and motivational drivers. Furthermore, the research examines how participants' views change before and after the event. The paper contains the insights of educators who, relying on their experiences at the hackathon, emphasize the importance of measuring and monitoring the outcome of the hackathon. Their perspectives highlight the motivation for promoting experimental learning methods in academic settings. This comprehensive research sheds light on multiple impacts of hackathon participation, which extend beyond knowledge acquisition to include changes in technological interests, success in specific domains, and the broader implications of hackathons as a transformative learning experience. The research contributes to the ongoing discussion about innovative approaches to learning. It provides a foundation for a better understanding of how hackathons shape attitudes and contribute to long-term outcomes for both students and teachers, establishing a conceptual framework for hackathon-based learning approaches and opportunities to monitor the effects of hackathons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) energy trading has emerged as a promising scheme to relieve the load imposed on the grid without intermediaries. The blockchain has always been regarded as the most potential solution for addressing the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV). The consensus mechanism is the core of the blockchain, it determines the security, efficiency, and scalability of the system. However, consensus mechanisms currently employed in V2V energy trading are traditional algorithms, which are unsuitable for the IoEV due to their high computational power and communication overhead. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a Block Alliance Consensus (BAC) mechanism based on Hashgraph. BAC can maintain the high throughput of the Hashgraph, and it solves the problem that the Hashgraph cannot support the dynamic addition and deletion of nodes if it is directly applied to V2V energy trading. We utilize the sharding technique, and each shard generates a consortium blockchain in accordance with the characteristic of the IoEV. The centralized component is retained to ensure macroeconomic control by state and local governments. We design a cryptography-based leader election combined with a reputation incentive mechanism to fairly elect centralized leader committee and motivate honest electric vehicles (EVs). We implement the BAC consensus and V2V energy trading blockchain (ETB) on the Hyperledger Fabric. The performance and practicality of BAC and the V2V ETB are verified through experiments.",

The multi-layered architecture integrates blockchain technology with other VPP components, such as a cloud service provider, grid and transmission operator, and forecasting of DERs, to optimize bidding and scheduling in real-time across multiple markets to enhance energy efficiency and grid stability. By employing a system engineering methodology, this framework incorporates smart meters to facilitate the transmission and reception of data i.e., voltage, and current between participants, and DERs within the network. This strategy makes it easier to advance sustainable energy sources, which advances predictive capabilities, strengthens the frameworkâs resilience, and protects the environment. The investigation of demand response, functional and system trade-off analysis, configuration selection, and other subsystems within a decentralized network offers insights into the necessary components and challenges involved in the construction of such a system.

However, managing a complex SC depends on multiple variables related to the SC and its environment. In addition, digital technologies have shown potential to reshape the present understanding of SC management. In this regard, blockchain technology (BT) can help business models by enhancing transparency, improving traceability, reducing costs, minimizing risks, and bringing resiliency to the SC processes. This paper follows the Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV) theory as a theoretical lens to investigate the capabilities of the BT and its impact on supply chain resilience (SCR). The paper uses a PLS-SEM method for analyzing the collected data and drawing evidence from the manufacturing and assembling industries to demonstrate the technological benefits and potential of BT, as well as its capacity to drive SCR and enhance efficiency in business models. The findings of the paper show that the sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities of the BT have a substantial effect on SCR (R2 adjusted= 0.701). The obtained results from this study highlight the potential of adopting BT to help policymakers in their query to build SCR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper delves into the crucial challenge of safeguarding data sensitivity and preventing security breaches, which can result in substantial losses, including significant financial costs and potential loss of lives. Notably, the United States faces the highest financial burden, with data breaches costing approximately USD 5.09 million. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enormous volumes of data are collected from diverse sources. However, the inherent limitations in computational power and memory of IoT devices render them susceptible targets for malicious attacks. This study focuses on fortifying the security of multimedia data, encompassing audio, video, and images, obtained from IoT devices. Cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and quantum cryptography are explored as promising avenues to bolster multimedia security and preserve privacy. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) emerges as an alternative to classical encryption and key distribution methods, offering heightened data security. Simultaneously, blockchain leverages hash functions to augment the overall security posture. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD facilitates secure key exchange between involved parties for data encryption and decryption. Additionally, the paper introduces innovative methodologies to enhance the security, privacy, and anonymity of IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Traditional email systems can only achieve one-way communication, which means only the receiver is allowed to search for emails on the email server. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based certificateless bidirectional authenticated searchable encryption model for a cloud email system named certificateless authenticated bidirectional searchable encryption (CL-BSE) by combining the storage function of cloud server with the communication function of email server. In the new model, not only can the data receiver search for the relevant content by generating its own trapdoor, but the data owner also can retrieve the content in the same way. Meanwhile, there are dual authentication functions in our model. First, during encryption, the data owner uses the private key to authenticate their identity, ensuring that only legal owner can generate the keyword ciphertext. Second, the blockchain verifies the data ownerâs identity by the received ciphertext, allowing only authorized members to store their data in the server and avoiding unnecessary storage space consumption. We obtain a formal definition of CL-BSE and formulate a specific scheme from the new system model. Then the security of the scheme is analyzed based on the formalized security model. The results demonstrate that the scheme achieves multi-keyword ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-keyword trapdoor privacy against any adversary simultaneously. In addition, performance evaluation shows that the new scheme has higher computational and communication efficiency by comparing it with some existing ones.",

Many machine learning algorithms are applied to detect such illegal behavior. These algorithms are often trained on the transaction behavior and, in some cases, trained on the vulnerabilities that exist in the system. In our approach, we study the feasibility of using the Domain Name (DN) associated with the account in the blockchain and identify whether an account should be tagged malicious or not. Here, we leverage the temporal aspects attached to the DN. Our approach achieves 89.53% balanced-accuracy in detecting malicious blockchain DNs. While our results identify 73769 blockchain DNs that show malicious behavior at least once, out of these, 34171 blockchain DNs show persistent malicious behavior, resulting in 2479 malicious blockchain DNs over time. Nonetheless, none of these identified malicious DNs were reported in new officially tagged malicious blockchain DNs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo solve the problem of climate warming, countries around the world have paid special attention to the construction of carbon governance. Carbon emission accounting is an important policy tool to control the vented CO\n. But at present, there are third-party agencies in carbon emission accounting that cannot ensure the fairness and impartiality of accounting, and there may be risks such as illegal use and leakage of sensitive information in the process of carbon emission data transmission. Therefore, We design the blockchain-based carbon emission security accounting scheme (BCESAS) and propose cross-chain verification contract to ensure the efficiency of cross-chain information accounting. In addition, bilinear pairing is used to ensure data integrity, and we encrypt private data using an improved and more secure homomorphic encryption algorithm to ensure that privacy is not leaked during the transfer of carbon emission data, which is more efficient than other homomorphic encryption algorithms. We also use reputation mechanism to regulate the behavior of carbon emission auditors. The theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates that BCESAS can verify the integrity, correctness and privacy of cross-chain data calculation result effectively, realizing secure and reliable expansion of blockchain.",

In particular, quality-relevant documents are not documented and communicated in a traceable and transparent manner, which often leads to quality deficiencies. However, combining AM with blockchain technology can enable a solution that maps the AM value chain digitally, transparently, traceably and securely in a part record. In this work, a quality assurance (QA) concept for the metal-based material extrusion (MEX) process is developed that enables a digital representation of the value chain in the form of an AM part record. The decentralized solution presented in this work uses an architecture consisting of a web application for data acquisition, a decentralized storage solution for storing larger amounts of data, a smart contract for capturing manufacturing events and the Ethereum blockchain for transparent, secure and traceable storage of blockchain data. The AM part record enables traceable and constantly available digital documentation of quality information. The cost-effectiveness of the solution is also shown in a demonstration study. The research results highlight the benefits of a blockchain-based AM part record for digital manufacturing documentation and represent an efficient alternative or extension to existing QM and QA solutions in AM.",

Specifically, maritime supply chains require numerous data and document exchanges and can significantly benefit from digital information sharing (DIS). This notable potential has attracted attention and has resulted in a growing number of studies on blockchain platforms, cloud-based platforms, and other digital technology platforms. However, DIS adoption and execution is a complex process as it depends on various success factors and barriers and affects numerous capabilities and performance outcomes. Moreover, various information systems and management theories can be utilised to underpin these relationships. Our study aims to conduct a systematic literature review that uncovers dynamic capabilities, barriers, enablers and outcomes of DIS with blockchain and cloud-based platforms, illustrates the relationship between them, and discloses methods and theories applied in supply chains. We discuss different use cases of blockchain and cloud-based platforms for DIS in various business functions in supply chains. Particularly, we reveal six DIS-powered capabilities, five performance outcomes improved by the DIS, eight main barriers, and nine enablers of DIS implementation. The lack of theoretical underpinning and causal empirical studies is identified as an important gap in the literature. This study also presents precise future research directions that can help address these gaps.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (86KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Consequently, our analyses tested the impact that blockchains have on customer purchase intentions in the food sector. Our results show that information provided to customers about the use of a blockchain to protect information throughout the supply chain can positively influence their purchase intentions. This study, consequently, offers new insights into the benefits generated by blockchains in the food sector and contributes to scientific understanding of the phenomenon overall. Moreover, our results provide insights that are also useful for managers and policymakers to further spread the use of blockchains.",

Paper-based profiles and defacement are vulnerable to spoofing, loss, and theft. Digital platforms with efficient IMS boost administrative processes and bring transparency and interoperability among establishments. The traditional paper-based identity systems are slow and rigid. Conventional centralized IMS lack transparency and are vulnerable to single-point failure. This paper presents a blockchain-aware decentralized identity management and access control (BADIMAC) model that mitigates these barriers. BADIMAC allows users to keep their digital identity within their control (i.e., self-sovereign identity). On the other hand, with the help of BADIMAC, service providers across enterprise boundaries can verify their identity without depending on any central authority. BADIMAC offers transparency and better security. The decentralized consensus-based design of BADIMAC enables the verifier to validate claims and establish proof of digital identity with process effectiveness.",

This often results in a high burden on central management systems and has adverse effects on energy prices. Blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading platforms can deliver strategic operation of decentralised multi-energy network among multiple domestic buildings to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and address global climate change issues. However, prevailing blockchain-based energy trading platforms focused on system implementation for peer-to-peer electricity trading while lacking predictive control and energy scheduling optimisation. Therefore, this paper presents an integrated blockchain and machine learning-based energy management framework for multiple forms of energy (i.e., heat and electricity) allocation and transmission, among multiple domestic buildings. Machine learning is harnessed to predict day-ahead energy generation and consumption patterns of prosumers and consumers within the multi-energy network. The proposed blockchain and machine learning-based decentralised energy management framework will establish optimal and automated energy allocation among multiple energy users through peer-to-peer energy transactions. This approach focuses on energy-matching from both the supply and demand sides while encouraging direct energy trading between prosumers and consumers. The security and fairness of energy trading can also be enhanced by using smart contracts to strictly execute the energy trading and bill payment rules. A case study of 4 real-life domestic buildings is introduced to determine the economic and technical potential of the proposed framework. In comparison to prevailing approaches, a key benefit from the proposed approach is an improved computational load/failure of a single point, energy trading strategy, workload, and capital cost energy. Findings suggest that energy costs reduced between 7.60% and 25.41% for prosumer buildings and a fall of 5.40%-17.63% for consumer buildings. In practical applications, the proposed approach can involve a larger number of prosumer and consumer buildings within the community to decentralise multiple energy trading, thus significantly contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing environmental sustainability.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (162KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Smart parks serve as integral components of smart cities, where they play a pivotal role in the process of urban modernization. The demand for cross-domain cooperation among smart devices from various parks has witnessed a significant increase. To ensure secure communication, device identities must undergo authentication. The existing cross-domain authentication schemes face issues such as complex authentication paths and high certificate management costs for devices, making it impractical for resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a blockchain-based lightweight and efficient cross-domain authentication protocol for smart parks, which simplifies the authentication interaction and requires every device to maintain only one certificate. To enhance cross-domain cooperation flexibility, a comprehensive certificate revocation mechanism is presented, significantly reducing certificate management costs while ensuring efficient and secure identity authentication. When a park needs to revoke access permissions of several cooperative partners, the revocation of numerous cross-domain certificates can be accomplished with a single blockchain write operation. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate the security and effectiveness of our scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the context of the complex and changing international situation and the uncertain global political and economic situation, cross-border trade faces many new challenges. In the form of \"barter\", cross-border barter avoids the credit creation needs of financial intermediaries, but puts forward higher requirements for the information coordination and resource integration of each subject in the transaction chain. The construction of a new type of cross-border barter biological system emphasizes the cooperation and interaction among the participants, and effectively integrates the barter link by means of financial technology, which is of great significance to promote the development of new cross-border barter trade. In this context, this paper proposes an ecosystem framework combining fintech and cross-border barter, and deeply studies the settlement model based on cross-border barter. The results show that the new cross-border barter ecosystem consists of platform leaders, barter trading entities, logistics warehousing supporters and environmental parasitism groups. The application of fintech can promote the collaboration of all parties in the ecosystem and realize the complementary advantages of system members. Through evolutionary game analysis, this paper finds that promoting cooperation among various groups, optimizing incentive policies of leaders and establishing fair profit distribution mechanism are conducive to the stable development of cross-border barter ecosystem. This paper designs a blockchain-based cross-border barter settlement model by referring to the Trade Swap Support Instrument (INSTEX) and the Bank of Kunlun's settlement model for Iran. Blockchain technology is used to achieve property rights allocation and value transfer of barter assets, and the barter settlement model of cross-border circulation of goods and domestic settlement of funds is realized through the \"closed loop\" of debt repayment, further exploring the deep-level settlement problems of cross-border barter, and providing theoretical support and practical guidance for the development of new cross-border barter trade.",

    "abstract": "The enormous volume of heterogeneous data from various smart device-based applications has growingly increased a deeply interlaced cyber-physical system. In order to deliver smart cloud services that require low latency with strong computational processing capabilities, the Edge Intelligence System (EIS) idea is now being employed, which takes advantage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Edge Computing Technology (ECT). Thus, EIS presents a potential approach to enforcing future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly within a context of a Vehicular Network (VNets). However, the current EIS framework meets some issues and is conceivably vulnerable to multiple adversarial attacks because the central aggregator server handles the entire system orchestration. Hence, this paper introduces the concept of distributed edge intelligence, combining the advantages of Federated Learning (FL), Differential Privacy (DP), and blockchain to address the issues raised earlier. By performing decentralized data management and storing transactions in immutable distributed ledger networks, the blockchain-assisted FL method improves user privacy and boosts traffic prediction accuracy. Additionally, DP is utilized in defending the userâs private data from various threats and is given the authority to bolster the confidentiality of data-sharing transactions. Our model has been deployed in two strategies: First, DP-based FL to strengthen user privacy by masking the intermediate data during model uploading. Second, blockchain-based FL to effectively construct secure and decentralized traffic management in vehicular networks. The simulation results demonstrated that our framework yields several benefits for VNets privacy protection by forming a distributed EIS with privacy budget (Îµ) of 4.03, 1.18, and 0.522, achieving model accuracy of 95.8%, 93.78%, and 89.31%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCollaboration of business processes is essential for business-to-business (B2B) processes. Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.",

The metaverse aims to bring 3D immersive and personalized experiences to users by leveraging many pertinent technologies. Despite great attention and benefits, a natural question in the metaverse is how to secure its usersâ digital content and data. In this regard, blockchain is a promising solution owing to its distinct features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. To better understand the role of blockchain in the metaverse, we aim to provide an extensive survey on the applications of blockchain for the metaverse. We first present a preliminary to blockchain and the metaverse and highlight the motivations behind the use of blockchain for the metaverse. Next, we extensively discuss blockchain-based methods for the metaverse from technical perspectives, such as data acquisition, data storage, data sharing, data interoperability, and data privacy preservation. For each perspective, we first discuss the technical challenges of the metaverse and then highlight how blockchain can help. Moreover, we investigate the impact of blockchain on key-enabling technologies in the metaverse, including Internet-of-Things, digital twins, multi-sensory and immersive applications, artificial intelligence, and big data. We also present some major projects to showcase the role of blockchain in metaverse applications and services. Finally, we present some promising directions to drive further research innovations and developments toward the use of blockchain in the metaverse in the future.",

    "abstract": "Plasma therapy is an extensively used treatment for critically unwell patients. For this procedure, a legitimate plasma donor who can continue to supply plasma after healing is needed. However, significant dangers are associated with supply management, such as the ambiguous provenance of plasma and the spread of infected or subpar blood into medicinal fabrication. Also, from an ideological standpoint, less powerful people may be exploited throughout the contribution process. Moreover, there is a danger to the logistics system because there are now just some plasma shippers. This research intends to investigate the blockchain-based solution for blood plasma to facilitate authentic plasma transfer. Blockchain parameters, including electronic identification, chain code, and certified ledgers, have the potential to exert a substantial, profound influence on the distribution and implementation process of blood banks. To understand the practical ramifications of blockchain, the current study provides a proof of concept approach that aims to simulate the procedural code of modern plasma distribution ecosystems using a blockchain-based architecture. The agent-based modeling used in the testing and evaluation mimics the supply chain to assess the blockchainâs feasibility, advantages, and constraints for the plasma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe continuous growth of blockchain has brought revolutionary impact on different areas with characteristics like decentralization, trust-worthy and tampering-proof. In the financial field, forecasting stock market had remained a challenging task for researchers. A novel integration of convolution and LSTM along with attention mechanism is proposed for prediction of stock price for the last hour of a day based itâs performance in six hours for making prediction in intraday trades. The proposed prediction model uses 4 different stocks of Apple, Facebook, Nike and Uber for data input. The input data is given to the combination of many convolutional and LSTM layers for predicting future value of stocks in short term. Furthermore, the proposed model combines the obtained data with LSTM layers output vectors enhanced for final prediction. The prediction is based on past value of stocks. Performance evaluation is done based on RMSE and computational time. The average values obtained were 0.091 and 11.57 seconds respectively, showing itâs superiority from benchmark models. The obtained data is stored on blockchain for enhanced security. The model can further be tuned for predicting other markets and will be more efficient than market specific markets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a highly disruptive digital technology, blockchain provides new solutions for reshaping corporate governance mechanisms and improving resource allocation. We empirically examine the relationship between blockchain and corporate investment inefficiency. We find that blockchain can help improve corporate investment efficiency, and this result is valid after a series of robustness tests. Blockchain can not only significantly restrain overinvestment but also alleviate underinvestment. Reducing financing costs and alleviating agency conflicts are the two channels through which blockchain is associated with corporate investment efficiency, and financial reporting quality is the condition on which the channels depend. When the CEO holds few shares or the trade credit environment in the region where the company is located is poor, the effect of blockchain is more prominent than it is otherwise. Investment efficiency cannot be improved by blockchain for companies providing blockchain products or services to customers, only for those promoting their own operations and management with blockchain. Ultimately, blockchain can enhance companiesâ value by alleviating inefficient investment. We reveal the role of blockchain in corporate investment efficiency, furnish microeconomic evidence for the integration of digital technology and the real economy and provide implications for China to promote digital technology to drive high-quality company development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain (BC) bloat, characterized by excessive data growth on BC networks, presents a pressing challenge. The need for a comprehensive study addressing BC bloat solutions arises due to the scarcity of knowledge in this emerging area. This study advances knowledge along with practical insights and inspires innovative approaches to address BC bloat. This research explores various techniques proposed to combat BC bloat. Two technique themes are identified: on-chain and off-chain techniques. On-chain techniques focus on updating the consensus mechanism, block size, or database partition. This study identified five on-chain techniques: structural modification, pruning, sharding, ephemeral BC, and zk-SNARKs. Off-chain techniques focus on processing in parallel, bundling transactions, or handling transactions off-chain. Further, three off-chain techniques identified are off-chain storage, historical data storage, and light clientsâ techniques. These recommendations aim to optimize resources use, enhance scalability, and maintain data integrity. However, these may compromise several BC capabilities, such as security, privacy, and data loss. The applicability of these techniques for resource-constrained devices is also explored. Future research should include further investigation into the performance and applicability of these techniques, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT and fog computing.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of introducing blockchain into electronic archives sharing and utilization is to break the information barrier between electronic archives sharing departments by relying on technologies such as smart contract and asymmetric encryption. Aiming at the problem of dynamic permission management in common access control methods, a new access control method based on smart contract under blockchain is proposed, which improves the intelligence level under blockchain technology. Firstly, the Internet attribute access control model based on smart contract is established. For the dynamic access of heterogeneous devices, the management contract, permission judgment contract and access control contract are designed; Secondly, the access object credit evaluation algorithm based on particle swarm optimization radial basis function (PSO-RBF) neural network is used to dynamically generate the access node credit threshold combined with the access policy, so as to realize the intelligent access right management method. Finally, combined with the above models and algorithms, the workflow of electronic archives sharing and utilization model of multi blockchain is constructed. The experimental results show that the time-consuming of the process increases linearly with the number of continuous access to electronic archives blocks, and the secure access control of sharing and utilization is feasible, secure and effective.",

Such a network is of great importance in data transmission, particularly in incidents and disasters, whether man-made or natural. However, message integrity and confidentiality are of concern when dealing with vital and physiological data transmission under strict privacy regulations. In this work, we propose a structure to classify messages based on their priority in different queues. Furthermore, due to the decentralized architecture of OppNets, we propose a blockchain-based structure for providing security for high-priority messages. It contains three sequences of functional blocks with a light and simplified implementation that make it suitable for battery-powered wearable devices that are limited in energy consumption and computational units. The simulation results show that by increasing the number of nodes in the network, the average of the changes in block sizes is neglectable, which addresses the computation bottleneck. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed structure in terms of message delivery and network overhead compared with the Epidemic and Prophet routing algorithms. These results indicate advancing the overall performance of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The carbon trading market can promote âcarbon peakingâ and âcarbon neutralityâ at low cost, but carbon emission quotas face attacks such as data forgery, tampering, counterfeiting, and replay in the electricity trading market. Certificateless signatures are a new cryptographic technology that can address traditional cryptographyâs general essential certificate requirements and avoid the problem of crucial escrow based on identity cryptography. However, most certificateless signatures still suffer from various security flaws. We present a secure and efficient certificateless signing scheme by examining the security of existing certificateless signature schemes. To ensure the integrity and verifiability of electricity carbon quota trading, we propose an electricity carbon quota trading scheme based on a certificateless signature and blockchain. Our scheme utilizes certificateless signatures to ensure the validity and nonrepudiation of transactions and adopts blockchain technology to achieve immutability and traceability in electricity carbon quota transactions. In addition, validating electricity carbon quota transactions does not require time-consuming bilinear pairing operations. The results of the analysis indicate that our scheme meets existential unforgeability under adaptive selective message attacks, offers conditional identity privacy protection, resists replay attacks, and demonstrates high computing and communication performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCrowdsourcing platforms play a crucial role in promoting transparency and collaborative engagement among participants while aiming to reduce resource consumption and costs. To achieve this, these platforms incorporate mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating worker quality performance. However, significant challenges persist. Centralized systems present trust issues due to their vulnerability to single-point failures. Moreover, data manipulation by malicious actors undermine confidence in the evaluation process, and biased assessments and reward distribution may lead to reduced worker motivation. Addressing these concerns necessitates the development of a decentralized system that ensures trustworthiness, tamper-resistance, accountability, reliability, transparency, and security. This paper introduces a secure multi-tier worker quality evaluation crowdsourcing framework based on blockchain technology. WQCrowd utilizes smart contracts and adopts a three-tier model comprising the Identity, Worker Activity, and Reputation tiers. Additionally, an automated game-based worker evaluation method is incorporated, enhancing the precision of performance assessments. Through our Proof of Concept (PoC) analysis, we demonstrate that the utilization of the blockchain system effectively addresses security concerns, including trust, privacy, and accountability, prevalent in current worker performance evaluation systems. Furthermore, the implementation of the game-based automated system enables our proposed solution to make informed decisions regarding worker quality performance evaluation.",

In SG environment, the Smart Meters (SMs) mostly exchange services and data from Service Providers (SPs) via insecure public channel. This makes the entire SG ecosystem vulnerable to various security threats. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we incorporate Digital Twin (DT) technology, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Deep Learning (DL) and blockchain into the design of a novel SG network. Specifically, a secure communication channel is first designed using an authentication method based on blockchain technology that has the ability to withstand a number of well-known assaults. Second, a new DL architecture that includes a self-attention mechanism, a Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, fully connected layers, and a softmax classifier is designed to enhance the attack detection process in SG environments. To deliver low latency and real-time services, the SDN is next employed as the networkâs backbone to send requests from SMs to a global SDN controller. DT technology is finally integrated into the SDN control plane, which stores the operating states and behavior models of SMs and communicates with SMs. The efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the blockchain implementation used in the SG network to assess computing time for the various numbers of transactions per block. Finally, the numerical results based on the N-BaIoT dataset shows better intrusion detection.",

Two technical challenges are addressed: motivating federated learning members to contribute their time and effort, and ensuring accurate aggregation of the global model by the centralized federated learning server. To overcome these issues and establish a decentralized solution, the integration of blockchain and federated learning proves effective, offering enhanced security and privacy for smart healthcare. The proposed approach includes a gamified element to incentivize and recognize contributions from federated learning members. This research work offers a solution involving resource management within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) using a newly proposed trust decentralized loop federated learning consensus blockchain. The obtained raw data is pre-processed by using handling missing values and adaptive min-max normalization. The appropriate features are selected with the aid of hybrid weighted-leader exponential distribution optimization algorithm. Because, data with multiple features exhibits varying levels of variation across each feature. The selected features are then forwarded to the training phase through the proposed pyramid squeeze attention generative adversarial networks to classify the EHR as positive and negative. The proposed classification model demonstrates high flexibility and scalability, making it applicable to a wide range of network architectures for various computer vision tasks. The introduced model provides better outcomes in terms of 98.5% in the training accuracy and 99% in the validation accuracy over Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, which is more efficient than the other traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nFor the past decade, there has been a significant increase in customer usage of public transport applications in smart cities. These applications rely on various services, such as communication and computation, provided by additional nodes within the smart city environment. However, these services are delivered by a diverse range of cloud computing-based servers that are widely spread and heterogeneous, leading to cybersecurity becoming a crucial challenge among these servers. Numerous machine-learning approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the cybersecurity challenges in heterogeneous transport applications within smart cities. However, the centralized security and scheduling strategies suggested so far have yet to produce optimal results for transport applications. This work aims to present a secure decentralized infrastructure for transporting data in fog cloud networks. This paper introduces Multi-Objectives Reinforcement Federated Learning Blockchain (MORFLB) for Transport Infrastructure. MORFLB aims to minimize processing and transfer delays while maximizing long-term rewards by identifying known and unknown attacks on remote sensing data in-vehicle applications. MORFLB incorporates multi-agent policies, proof-of-work hashing validation, and decentralized deep neural network training to achieve minimal processing and transfer delays. It comprises vehicle applications, decentralized fog, and cloud nodes based on blockchain reinforcement federated learning, which improves rewards through trial and error. The study formulates a combinatorial problem that minimizes and maximizes various factors for vehicle applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MORFLB effectively reduces processing and transfer delays while maximizing rewards compared to existing studies. It provides a promising solution to address the cybersecurity challenges in intelligent transport applications within smart cities. In conclusion, this paper presents MORFLB, a combination of different schemes that ensure the execution of transport data under their constraints and achieve optimal results with the suggested decentralized infrastructure based on blockchain technology.",

The complexity of globally dispersed supply chains is a major challenge for SCT. Blockchain technology's ability to support information sharing in a distributed network and create an immutable and traceable digital record of historical transactions makes it an attractive option for SCT. However, a major challenge persists â defining the scope of a blockchain-enabled SCT solution in terms of the number stages of the supply chain encompassed and the granularity of information captured at each supply chain stage. We analyze multiple cross-industry case studies and conduct an expert executive workshop to identify empirically the motivations and contextual factors influencing the diversity in the scope of traceability targeted by different organizations. We present a new evidence-based framework to define the scope of SCT depending on the motivations for and purpose of traceability. The framework specifies five identification categories and five levels of granularity of information within each category to inform and support decision-making on the types of data to capture across the supply chain for effective and scalable deployment of blockchain-enabled SCT solutions. The study highlights the need for more research examining the optimal level of traceability for different industries and supply chain configurations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs the global population continues to grow, the enormous stress on our environment and resources is becoming impossible to ignore. A focus on producing and consuming as cheaply as possible has created an economy in which objects are briefly used and then discarded as waste, featuring a linear lifecycle that creates an enormous amount of waste. The alternative to the linear economy âtake-make-wasteâ is called the âcircular economyâ. Under this paradigm, materials are recycled to build new products or components that are designed and built to promote their reuse and refurbishment. This assures the continuous (re-)exploitation of existing resources, reducing the extraction of new raw materials. However, customers often reject these reused or refurbished products under the suspicion that they do not meet the same usability, safety, or performance levels of new products. In this sense, trustworthy records of historical details of refurbished products could increase consumersâ confidence in products and components of the âcircular economyâ, prioritizing trustworthiness, reliability, and transparency. This work presents a new certification tool based on blockchain technology to guarantee trusted, accurate, transparent, and traceable lifecycle information of products and their components and to generate trustworthy certificates to probe refurbished product historical details. This tool aims to enhance refurbished product visibility by creating the basis for making the circular economy a reality in any domain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has been rapidly growing since Bitcoin was invented in 2008. The most common type of blockchain system, public (permissionless) blockchain system, has some unique features that lead to a tension with the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other similar data protection laws. In this paper, we report the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on 114 research papers discussing and/or addressing such a tension. To the best of our knowledge, our SLR is the most comprehensive review of this tension, leading to a more in-depth and broader analysis of related research work on this important topic. Our results revealed three main types of issues: (i) difficulties in exercising data subjectsâ rights such as the âright to be forgottenâ (RTBF) due to the immutable nature of public blockchains; (ii) difficulties in identifying roles and responsibilities in the public blockchain data processing ecosystem (particularly on the identification of data controllers and data processors); and (iii) ambiguities regarding the application of the relevant law(s) due to the distributed nature of blockchains. Our work also led to a better understanding of solutions for improving the GDPR compliance of public blockchain systems. It can help inform not only blockchain researchers and developers but also policymakers and law markers to consider how to reconcile the tension between public blockchain systems and data protection laws (the GDPR and beyond).",

This is further compounded by the need for the industry to answer new challenges to meet the requirement of the International Maritime Organization 2020. The aim of this work is to illustrate how blockchain technology may be adopted for aiding in bunker dispute resolution.\nTo demonstrate how blockchain may aid in disputes within the bunker industry, this paper first examines the existing bunker supply process, which involves the formation of contracts under English law, the Bunker Delivery Notes, the different types of disputes that may arise during a bunker transaction and the methods of dispute resolution utilised by the industry. Furthermore, the current literature in relation to blockchain technology and blockchain smart contracts is examined. Finally, interviews and surveys within the industry have been conducted to identify the benefits and challenges in adopting blockchain technology.\nThe research found that blockchains may benefit the bunker supply chain offering the effective resolution of bunker quality disputes. Furthermore, blockchains may also serve as a verification tool for electronic bunker delivery notes, which may aid quality and quantity bunker disputes as well as compliance with the new International Maritime Organisation 2020 requirements. As a result, despite the research having shown blockchain to be situationally dependent and having an element of legal uncertainty, blockchain does offer a solution to aid in bunker disputes and for improving the trust and credibility within the bunker industry.",

    "abstract": "The data in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) contains tremendous market value, and data sharing can maximize the usefulness of the data. However, certain data is quite sensitive, and sharing it directly may violate privacy. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a secure distributed machine learning framework that completes joint model training by passing encrypted model parameters rather than raw data, so there is no data privacy leakage during the training process. Therefore, the VFL can build a bridge between data demander and owner to realize data sharing while protecting data privacy. Typically, the VFL requires a third party for key distribution and decryption of training results. In this article, we employ the consortium blockchain instead of the traditional third party and design a VFL architecture based on the consortium blockchain for data sharing in MEC. More specifically, we propose a V-Raft consensus algorithm based on Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs), which is a variant of the Raft. The V-Raft is able to elect leader quickly and stably to assist data demander and owner to complete data sharing by VFL. Moreover, we apply secret sharing to distribute the private key to avoid the situation where the training result cannot be decrypted if the leader crashes. Finally, we analyzed the performance of the V-Raft and carried out simulation experiments, and the results show that compared with Raft, the V-Raft has higher efficiency and better scalability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe proliferation of blockchain technology has resulted in diverse token standards, posing challenges for compatibility, security, and performance in existing cross-chain bridges. This paper introduces a novel framework capable of concurrently facilitating fungible token exchange, as well as the processing of both individual and batch non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We deploy token bridges that meet different token standards to support cross-chain staking and unlocking of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155. To minimize both waiting times and handling fees, we relocate processes necessitating frequent transactions and verifications to the sidechain. Additionally, we adopt a batch-processing approach for tokens necessitating cross-chain transfers, leveraging payment channels to facilitate efficiency. The systemâs reliability is upheld through the validator group. Validators acquire an initial reputation value by making deposits and enhance both their rewards and reputation by successfully completing NFT auction tasks on the sidechain. We use OpenZeppelinâs security library functions to standardize token operations, and carefully design the validatorâs reward, punishment, and reputation mechanisms. Our comprehensive contract security audit and system analysis validate our solutionâs effectiveness in mitigating common vulnerabilities and internal threats. Implementation and testing with Ethereum and its test network demonstrate substantial reductions in transmission time for key cross-chain token steps by nearly half. Moreover, our framework showcases efficiency and cost-effectiveness with an average gas cost of 693,379.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAccording to World Economic Forum the COVID-19 crisis exposed the vulnerabilities in global supply chains. One notable impact was in shipping rates, as transport ground to a halt and a worldwide backlog of containers built up in ports around the world. Another was a dramatic increase in the number of people shopping online as measures to safeguard public health meant that many were confined to their homes. Logistics service providers were forced to get creative and identify means of mitigating costs while maintaining the speed and quality of service.\nWithin the commodity supply chain, there are many stakeholders, each with their own set of platforms and methods. Multiple versions of the same document can inundate end-users, especially if they need to enter one set of data in multiple places. These circumstances open up loopholes for fraudulent or malicious activity in the supply chain. Logistics suppliers are fragmenting their operations in response to this shift, spreading out their processes to minimize concentration risk and the disruption caused by events like geopolitical tension or a pandemic.\nUsing a world production growth function the contribution of the Logistics Performance Index(LPI) components of 133 countries has been estimated for the period 2007-2018 through the econometric method of panel data with fixed effects.\nBlockchain Technology can guarantee transparency and quality, and automation where Smart Contracts can be written and often reused between different entities and a set of agreements that can automatically take effect after a period or condition is met.\nThe content of the paper reflects the results of research conducted on the contribution of logistics port and freight transport with which we can solve inefficiencies in the ease of arranging international shipments at competitive prices with Blockchain to get Automation of whole supply chain with ports nodes.",

Since blockchain technology (BCT) allows for the development of a distributed environment, it is ideal for supply chain management (SCM) applications. However, concerns regarding data privacy have impeded the development of blockchains. Despite the fact that some blockchains can restrict participants from reading and/or writing data, blockchainâs transparency makes protecting sensitive data challenging. To solve the data privacy challenge, this paper proposes a framework, AccessChain, that is an SCM access control framework that is based on an attribute-based access control (ABAC) model that restricts access to competing parties while allowing for network scalability. This proposed AccessChain model has two types of ledgers in its system: local and global. Local ledgers are used to store business contracts between stakeholders and the attribute-based access control model management, whereas the global ledger is used to record transaction data. AccessChain can enable decentralized, fine-grained and dynamic access control management in SCM when combined with the ABAC model and BCT. This paperâs experimental results illustrate that high throughput can be achieved in a large-scale request environment while maintaining data privacy and sustaining a scalable network.",

Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamirâs secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed frameworkâs performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of distributed electric vehicles (EV), energy management in the Internet of vehicles (IoV) has attracted more attention, especially demand response (DR) management to achieve efficient energy management in IoV. Therefore, it is a tendency to introduce distributed energy such as renewable energy into the existing supply system. For optimizing the energy internet (EI) for IoV, in this paper, we introduce blockchain into energy internet and propose a secure EI scheme for IoV based on post-quantum blockchain, which provides the new information services and an incentive cooperation mechanism for the current energy IoV system. Firstly, based on the principles of constructing a short lattice basis and preimage sampling, a lattice signature scheme is proposed and used in blockchain for authentication, which provides anti-quantum security. Secondly, we design the EI based on the post-quantum blockchain model. Lastly, based on this model, we design a secure EI scheme for IoV based on post-quantum blockchain. Through our analysis and experiment, this new scheme can increase the efficiency of energy utilization and enrich EIâs application in IoV. In particular, we further illustrate and analyze its performance. It is shown that EI based on post-quantum blockchain is more secure and efficient in information communications and energy trading.",

Blockchain technology applications in procurement can work as a major enabler in this process. Despite the unquestionable relevance of Blockchain Technology (BCT)-integrated Procurement, no comprehensive review exists. Considering this significant research gap, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive literature review by deeply examining 95 highly relevant papers published from January 2012 to Sep 2023. Existing literature studies suggest BCT as the imitable enabler of the Procurement 4.0 era, yet the topic has not been fully explored and researched. This study identifies noteworthy deficits in theoretical underpinnings, technological contributions in generating new revenue models, radical impacts anticipated on the procurement organization restructuring, and so forth. The research is timely and importantly advantageous because it offers a holistic view of relevant literature-driven evidence about a range of existing dimensions on the subject. More specifically, this study provides exhaustive key recommendations for future research on BCT applications in procurement utilizing the Theory, Context, and Methodology (TCM) framework.",

Specifically, we identify-five potential advantages of blockchain-based programs over traditional loyalty programs pertaining to usage, accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability. We then apply expectancy theory to assess consumersâ perceptions in two empirical studies, both of which reveal an overall preference for blockchain-based loyalty programs over traditional models: an analysis of 5,059 Twitter tweets detects more positive feedback for the blockchain-based program, and a survey of 206 consumers reveals a significantly more positive attitude toward the blockchain-based loyalty program with respect to accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (292KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the development of Internet technology, secure storage and secure sharing of data have become increasingly important. Traditional data sharing schemes exist a series of problems including lack of security and low efficiency. In this paper, we construct a secure and efficient data sharing scheme based on threshold Paillier algorithm and blockchain technology, which achieves secure data storage and sharing without a third-party institution. Firstly, we propose a\nthreshold Paillier blockchain data sharing scheme, which effectively prevents decryption failures caused by the loss of a single nodeâs private key. Secondly, we propose a combined on-chain and off-chain data storage scheme, we store the ciphertext on the cloud server and the ciphertext hash value on the blockchain, which not only ensures the integrity of the data but also solves the storage limitation problem on the blockchain. Finally, we use the simulation paradigm to prove the security of the scheme in the semi-honest model. The discussion results of the comparison and the analysis of performance show that the blockchain data security sharing scheme proposed in this paper has lower computational overhead and higher security than other similar schemes.",

However, this sharing process is subject to cyberâphysical contingency conditions, which limits its accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that incorporates a cyber-layer with the power system to ensure accurate sharing of the generatorsâ dynamic states. The proposed framework utilizes a weighted average consensus mechanism within a blockchain environment. The consensus ensures that the communication links/data among generator buses are reliable in both directions and that any link/data failure is detected to guarantee the validity, and hence accuracy of the shared generatorsâ states. Moreover, a smart contract at each generator applies the proposed consensus mechanism and credits the validator generator bus that creates the next block in the statesâ blockchain after achieving the consensus. Finally, the proposed framework is tested on the standard IEEE 3-generator 9-bus power system under data contingency conditions. The generatorsâ speed states are tested, while the other states can be verified in a similar manner. Simulation results show the ability of the proposed framework to ensure accurate sharing of the generatorsâ speed states and to detect possible cyber-attacks, compared to the case without using the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe main objective of this article is to present a prototype that integrates blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to digitize information across a generic Supply Chain (SC). Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain has been viewed as a breakthrough and an innovative technology due to its privacy, security, immutability, and data integrity characteristics. The consensus layer of the blockchain is the backbone and the most important layer of the blockchain architecture because it acts as the performance and security manager of the blockchain. The detection of Long-Range Attacks (LRA) on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain is a complex task. Earlier studies have shown various challenges in detecting long-range attacks and monitoring the activities of validator nodes on the blockchain network. Thus, this paper proposes a novel dataset for node classification on a proof-of-stake permissionless blockchain and proposes a Deep Learning method that can be used to classify nodes into malicious or non-malicious nodes to mitigate long-range attacks with high accuracy. The performance metrics for the model are compared and measured which suggest the developed performance of the proposed model. The proposed solution can serve as a guide on how future researchers and blockchain developers can simulate and curate proof-of-stake datasets and goes further to demonstrate that artificial intelligence models can be used as a mitigating checkpoint for long-range attacks. The dataset in the paper is publicly available and can be used by other researchers to detect other activities and behaviors on a permissionless blockchain. These techniques can further enhance security, performance and create fairness on the proof-of-stake consensus.",

In this context, blockchain technology has emerged as a possible answer to the future problems of the supply chain. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on blockchain in the context of supply chains. The goal of our work is to present the factors and capabilities of blockchain technology that contribute to improving supply chain resilience. We also show which supply chain management factors limit the use of blockchain technology. Based on this, we identify various areas and applications of blockchain technology to support supply chains and highlight current work in the field. From the reviewed literature, we deduce a number of open challenges regarding the application of blockchains in the context of supply chains, e.g. the need (a) to improve the implementation process, (b) to make blockchain more cost-effective, (c) to educate potential users regarding blockchain security aspects, and (d) to further digitize supply chains as part of the digital transformation process.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRenewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as a substitute for fossil energy production. However, distributed renewable energy production faces several challenges regarding trading and management, such as inflexible pricing models and inaccurate green consumption information. A decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity marketplace may address these challenges. It enables prosumers to market their self-produced electricity. However, such a marketplace needs to guarantee that the transactions follow market rules and government regulations, cannot be manipulated, and are consistent with the generated electricity. One of the ways to provide these guarantees is to leverage blockchain technology.\nThis work describes a decentralized blockchain-based P2P energy marketplace addressing privacy, trust, and governance issues. It uses a private permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HF) and its smart contracts to perform energy trading settlements. The suggested P2P marketplace includes a particular regulator actor acting as a governmental representative overseeing marketplace operations. In this way, the suggested P2P marketplace can address the governance issues needed in electricity marketplaces. Further, the proposed marketplace ensures actorsâ data privacy by employing HFâs private data collections while preserving the integrity and auditability of all operations. We present an in-depth performance evaluation and provide insights into the security and privacy challenges emerging from such a marketplace. The results demonstrate that partial centralization by the applied regulator does not limit the P2P energy trade settlement execution. Blockchain technology allows for automated marketplace operations enabling better incentives for prosumer electricity production. Finally, the suggested marketplace preserves the userâs privacy when P2P energy trade settlements are conducted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe demand for high data throughput and security in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication is rising. Efficient data transmission remains challenging due to limited wireless resources. This paper introduces a Scale Perception Compression Method that leverages compression and blockchain technology to optimize UAV communication. The method involves normalizing data into matrices, generating compression and decompression matrix codebook pairs, and selecting suitable pairs for small or large-scale matrices. Simulation results show that the error rate is associated with the distributions of the data and compression matrix. It remains relatively low when the data and compression matrix subjected to Uniform distribution compared to Gaussian distribution, regardless of the values of the number of rows m and columns r in compression matrix. Bubble method is more suitable to find out the proper matrix pair to compress and decompress transmitted data for small-scale codebook because it is stable, fast and results in lower difference between original and recovered data matrices. The same applies to Merge method for the large-scale codebook. The ER is always lower based on a small-scale codebook searching by Bubble method than that of on a large-scale codebook searching by Merge method, which indicates the former is sufficient for compression.",

    "abstract": "The research on the governing blockchain by blockchain supervision system is an important development trend of blockchain technology. In this system there is a supervisory blockchain managing and governing the supervised blockchain based on blockchain technology, results in a uniquely cross-blockchain demand to consensus mechanism for solving the trust problem between supervisory blockchain and supervised blockchain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a cross-blockchain consensus mechanism based on smart contract and a set of smart contracts endorse the cross-blockchain consensus. New consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Endorse-Contracts (PoEC) consensus, which firstly transfers the consensus reached in supervisory blockchain to supervised blockchain by supervisory nodes, then packages the supervisory block in supervisory blockchain and transmits it to the smart contract deployed in the supervised blockchain, finally miners in supervised blockchain will execute and package the new block according to the status of the smart contract. The core part of the consensus mechanism is Endorse Contracts which designed and implemented by us and verified the effectiveness through experiments. PoEC consensus mechanism and Endorse Contracts support the supervised blockchain to join the governing blockchain by blockchain system without changing the original consensus mechanism, which has the advantages of low cost, high scalability and being able to cross-blockchain. This paper proves that our method can provide a feasible cross-blockchain governance scheme for the field of blockchain governance.",

Nevertheless, several performance and vulnerability issues have been identified for the different typologies supporting the wide range of blockchain-based applications currently implemented in different domains.\nA variety of analytical and empirical models are being used to evaluate the issues associated with the different blockchain typologies, enabling systematic analyses of the corresponding efficiency impact, and technical or economic threats.\nA thorough systematic literature review of these models has been performed, followed by a detailed assessment on the way these models have been employed, and the target parameters and applications evaluated (336 research selected and analysed). We propose a co-classification of these models, allowing us to identify which ones are employed to a greater extent to address the different blockchain issues in scientific research. In a second step, a bibliometric analysis on the selected research is conducted, offering a complementary overview of the status of and trends in blockchain modelling, including the most prolific authors and leading contributing countries to the topic.\nThe main outcome and contribution of the paper is the provision of a broad overview on how blockchain issues have been analytically tackled, through the synthesis and meta-analysis of the models used in the scientific literature since the inception of blockchain technology. The results have two main direct applications, firstly supporting novel vulnerability and performance analyses of existing blockchain applications by providing historical information on the models used so far, as well as the key parameters and typology of the blockchain-based applications evaluated. Secondly, in the implementation of new applications, by allowing the recognition of key issues identified that are associated with the different blockchain typologies and to determine the most suitable models to analyse the weaknesses and risks of the alternative designs under evaluation for these new implementations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe traceability of what we eat is a lingering issue. Blockchain enables transparency across the value chain as it tracks a productâs origin, location, and history. In this work we adopt a mix-method approach - experiment plus qualitative evidence - to understand why consumers consider the traceability offered by blockchain important and what are the barriers that suppliers face when considering blockchain adoption. Our findings show that, when the food is local, blockchain increases consumersâ trust and, in turn, attitudes and behaviors toward the sharing experience. On the supply side, we find that, while operators see key benefits in blockchain adoption â including enhanced trust, they are still hesitant in using the technology because of a greater need for intra-organizational support and a concern in data sharing. By looking at both consumers and suppliers, we offer a complete picture on the integration of blockchain technology in the food supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nA long and short-term pseudo-identity algorithm is designed to protect EV usersâ privacy.\nâ¢\nA certificateless signcryption algorithm is designed to realize secure communication.\nâ¢\nAn improved PoR consensus mechanism is designed to improve the scheme's efficiency.\nAbstract\nWith the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) electricity transactions have gained popularity. Among them, EV users can easily obtain information such as their own location and speed through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and communicate with other entities through the IoV, but the leak of the electricity transaction plan and private information such as identity, location, speed, etc. required for the transaction may put the users in danger and undermine the fairness of the transaction. Aiming at the above problems, A V2V electricity transaction scheme with privacy protection based on the IoV and consortium blockchain is proposed. Firstly, a long-term and short-term pseudo-identity algorithm is designed for users participating in V2V transactions. Users conduct each electricity transaction with different short-term pseudo-identities to prevent the leakage of their identity information; and when fraudulent transactions occur, the real identity of the fraudulent users can be traced based on their long-term pseudo-identities or public key information. Secondly, a certificateless aggregate signcryption algorithm is designed for secure communication in the IoV. Finally, consortium blockchain technology is adopted to solve the problems of single point of failure and data tampering that exist in centralized transactions. At the same time, a reputation value evaluation mechanism based on transaction completion rate and a Proof of Reputation consensus mechanism based on fixed time and fixed block capacity packing method are also designed, which not only reduces the computational power consumption but also motivates the seller EV to conduct V2V electricity transactions in good faith. The theory proves that the scheme is capable of protecting the privacy of EV users effectively. The performance evaluations demonstrate that this scheme has low communication overhead and the computational overhead also has certain advantages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe architecture of cloud-based services is typically opaque and intricate. As a result, data subjects cannot exercise adequate control over their personal data, and overwhelmed data protection authorities must spend their limited resources in costly forensic efforts to ascertain instances of non-compliance. To address these data protection challenges, a group of computer scientists and socio-legal scholars joined forces in the Privacy-Aware Cloud Ecosystems (PACE) project to design a blockchain-based privacy-enhancing technology (PET). This article presents the fruits of this collaboration, highlighting the capabilities and limits of our PET, as well as the challenges we encountered during our interdisciplinary endeavour. In particular, we explore the barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration between law and computer science that we faced, and how these two fieldsâ different expectations as to what technology can do for data protection law compliance had an impact on the project's development and outcome. We also explore the overstated promises of techno-regulation, and the practical and legal challenges that militate against the implementation of our PET: most industry players have no incentive to deploy it, the transaction costs of running it make it prohibitively expensive, and there are significant clashes between the blockchain's decentralised architecture and GDPR's requirements that hinder its deployability. We share the insights and lessons we learned from our efforts to overcome these challenges, hoping to inform other interdisciplinary projects that are increasingly important to shape a data ecosystem that promotes the protection of our personal data.",

In doing so, a Pythagorean fuzzy-set-based DEMATEL method to assess these barriers in a complex environment is proposed. The results of the study suggest that âmarket-based risksâ, âhigh costs for maintaining sustainabilityâ, and âusage in the underground economyâ are the most influential barriers to the adoption of BT in CSCM. Furthermore, the study identifies that âinadequate knowledge/employee trainingâ, âcontractual riskâ, and âscalability issuesâ play a pivotal role within the CSCM system. The reliability and validation of the obtained results were also shown using sensitivity analysis and the focus-group-discussion approach. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the construction industry to design and implement effective measures to overcome the identified barriers to the adoption of BT in CSCM. By addressing these barriers, stakeholders can facilitate the adoption of BT, leading to more efficient and effective construction supply chain management practices.",

These gadgets offer remote observing and the exchange of wellbeing information, which enormously further develop the patient's personal satisfaction while at the same time reducing treatment expenses for both the patient and the medical care suppliers (telemedicine). For individuals' wellbeing, a cutting edge individual wellbeing record framework is fundamental. Here, there are still difficulties with information mix from different EHRs, information interoperability, and guaranteeing that admittance to information is totally under the power of the patient. Some security issues are caused by the Network. To settle these issues, we propose a novel profound learning-based framework that circuits state of the art decentralized innovations like IPFS and blockchain with wellbeing information interoperability principles and advances like FHIR's APIs. In this review, we show that correspondence between private clinical gadgets is as a matter of fact powerless to different cyber attacks. We show how an outer assailant could involve man-in-the-center, replay, bogus information infusion, and refusal of-administration assaults to block delicate wellbeing information stream by capturing the correspondence of the individual clinical gadget. We likewise suggest an Interruption Recognition Framework (IDS), GAN, to additional screen traffic on private clinical gear and spot attacks against them. Our extensive investigation shows that GAN, with an F1-score of 98 % and an accuracy of 98.7 %, can successfully and accurately recognise numerous assaults on personal medical equipment.",

This evolution has given rise to several metaverse platforms that utilize blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to establish ownership of metaverse elements and attach features and information to them. This article seeks to delve into the complexity and heterogeneity of the data involved in these metaverse platforms and highlight some of the dynamics and features that make them unique. Additionally, the paper introduces a metaverse analysis tool developed by the authors, which leverages machine learning techniques to collect and analyze daily data, including blockchain transactions, platform-specific metadata, and social media trends. The experimental results of our approach are presented with a use-case scenario focused on the trading of digital parcels, commonly referred to as metaverse real estate. This scenario allows us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool and showcase the potential of using machine learning techniques to analyze and gain insights into the metaverse ecosystem.",

Using blockchain, a data structure has been proposed to promptly register trust of vehicles on publicly available blocks, allowing any vehicle to retrieve. In the trials, tests on various datasets have been run. Suggested system is resistant to multiple trust model threats, improving the security of vehicles' confidentiality and privacy. The performance evaluation metrics are precision, recall, f-measure and false positive rate (FPR) are used to evaluate the proposed system. Results from the simulation show that the proposed method is efficient and practical in reality. The suggested method was tested in a simulated traffic situation to verify its effectiveness.",

The multichannel mechanism, private data collection and querying mechanism of HF enable private data sharing, transparency, traceability, and verification across the supply chain. However, the existing querying mechanism of HF needs further improvement for statistical data sharing because the query is evaluated on the original data recorded on the ledger. As a result, it gives rise to privacy issues such as leaking of business secrets, tracking of resources and assets, and disclosing of personal information. Therefore, we solve this problem by proposing a differentially private enhanced permissioned blockchain for private data sharing in the context of supply chain in IIoT which is known as (EDH-IIoT). First, we integrate differential privacy into the chaincode (smart contract) of HF which evaluates the query and adds a calibrated noise into it. Second, we propose an algorithm to efficiently utilize Ïµ through reuse of the privacy budget for the repeated queries. Third, we also propose an algorithm to track the privacy budget (Ïµ) and avoid the degrade of privacy preservation in case of multiple queries on the same portion of the ledger's data. Furthermore, the reuse and tracking of Ïµ enables the data owner to ensure that Ïµ does not exceed the threshold which is the maximum privacy budget (\n). Finally, we model two privacy attacks namely linking attack and composition attack to evaluate and compare privacy preservation, and the efficiency of reuse of Ïµ with the default chaincode of HF and traditional differential privacy model, respectively. The results confirm that EDH-IIoT obtains an accuracy of 97% in the shared data for Ïµ = 1, and a reduction of 35.96% in spending of Ïµ.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technologies are of great interest to marketers uncovering opportunities in the context of the sharing economy. The novel appeal of blockchain is that it provides an immutable audit trail of digital tokens and contracts via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network without the need for a market intermediary. It thus enables digital exchange without the need for a trusted central authority or third party, affording an infrastructure for a variety of applications. We assess how blockchain technologies facilitate sharing beyond its role as a technological protocol and how it instead operates as a social machine. We explore these implications for marketing philosophically through the lenses of assemblage and pharmakon. We identify two contradictions for marketers: (1) how marketing with blockchain technologies in the sharing economy challenges past institutional roles of marketers and seeks to eradicate them, and (2) how these technologies produce a new notion of capitalized sociality devoid of trust.",

The proposed logical model can be implemented on regular post-relational database servers linked with blockchain networks or through cloud services. The model was implemented on an Oracle Database 21c server using blockchain tables as an additional layer of security. Diferent types of users are granted access to traditional and blockchain tables based on their roles and certificates. Although blockchain tables introduce some latency, they can be optimised by caching, indexing, clustering, and partitioning data. The article presents the use of blockchain tables in Oracle databases as a practical and secure solution for managing medical data, ensuring the security and privacy of data while adapting to the individual needs of medical facilities.",

However, existing schemes based on single-chain architecture have the problems of storage limitation and scalability, and ignore the impact of event's priority and real-time on blockchain transaction. Therefore, for BOM, this paper provides a BOM framework based on sharding blockchain (SBC-BOMF), which constructs two-layer architecture based on master-chain and multiple shards, relieves the storage pressure of blockchain nodes and improves the concurrency capability. Priority-based transaction handling strategy is designed to achieve reasonable and rapid response for multi-level transactions. Finally, an actual BOM project is taken as example to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme; experiments are conducted for performance testing and evaluation. Results show that proposed scheme can effectively solve the scalability problem caused by the application of blockchain in BOM, reduce storage overhead, and realize efficient handling for blockchain transactions.",

Despite the potential benefits of trust creation and elimination of intermediary entities, adopting such innovative technologies promises to disrupt the current supply chains of those symbiotic networks. The literature on these topics is still beginning; thus, the present research intends to contribute. A framework for understanding the implications of adopting the blockchain technology in the supply chain structure (specifically, in the dependency dimension) of an additive symbiotic network was developed, considering a network theory lens. The case study method was deemed to be suitable for carrying out this research. A case study related to an additive symbiotic network is described in detail, with the development of two scenarios: scenario I âas-isâ for the current state of the network and scenario II âto-beâ considering the adoption of the blockchain technology. Results show that adopting blockchain technology impacts the supply chain structure of additive symbiotic networks. More specifically, there are implications for the power distribution among the networkâs stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDiabetes Mellitus, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has no cure to date and can lead to severe health complications, such as retinopathy, limb amputation, cardiovascular diseases, and neuronal disease, if left untreated. Consequently, it becomes crucial to be able to monitor and predict the incidence of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk factors. The proposed system is underpinned by blockchain to obtain a cohesive view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and ensure security and privacy of the user's data. We provide a comparative analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out within our proposed system, using the most accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the proposed system predicts diabetes using RF with 4.57% more accuracy on average in comparison with the other models LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant improvement. When using feature selection, the performance is improved by 1.14% for PIMA Indian and 0.02% for Sylhet datasets, while it is reduced by 0.89% for MIMIC III.",

In fact, transactions are confirmed according to a strong priority policy that favors those offering the highest fees. The problem of determining the optimal fee to offer to satisfy certain delay requirements is still widely open and, at the state of the art, mainly reactive methods based on historical data are available. In this work, we propose a queueing model based on the exact transient analysis of a\nsystem to address this problem. The model takes into account (\n) the state of the Mempool (the backlog of pending work) when the transaction is generated, (\n) the current transaction arrival intensity and (\n) the distribution of the fees offered by other transactions to the miners. We apply the model to study the performance of the Bitcoin blockchain. Its parameterization is based on an extensive statistical analysis of the transaction characteristics. To this aim, we collected data from over 1.5 million of pending transactions observed in the Mempool of our Bitcoin node. The outcome of our analysis allows us to provide an algorithm to quickly compute the expected transaction confirmation time given the blockchain state, and to highlight new insights on the relations between the transaction fees and confirmation time in BTC blockchain.",

As such, it is argued that blockchains could be used for validation, data management, transactions settlements and objective measurement for corporate sustainability indicators, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions during production processes. Following a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in data collection and database formation, the current work provides an analysis of the existing literature consisting of 59 contributions on blockchain applications in sustainability accounting. Several analysis steps containing bibliometric analyses were performed and presented, including novel coding of methodologies and industrial applications. Additionally, text mining analysis of the meta-data of contributions was conducted for the purpose of topic generation and retrieval of comparative insights. Results provide insights into the mapping of baseline technologies, regulatory environment, and practical factors outlined by previous contributions that influence the applications of blockchains for this cause. Future research areas include blockchains paired with other future-proof technologies, such as digital accounting tools (e.g. XBRL) or hardware IoT technologies in smart factories, to aid in the development of new pipelines of measurable and traceable sustainability information.",

This paradigm shift requires an energy market that supports its functions through well-designed market rules and transaction infrastructureâthe two ingredients that form a marketplace. Blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of both market rules and transaction infrastructure for newly emerging P2P transactive energy markets. In this paper, we propose a model for the design of a transactive energy marketplace using blockchain as transaction infrastructure based on game-theoretic market rules that incentivize a more sustainable energy generation and consumption behavior while preserving the privacy of economic agents in the market. We propose a novel consensus mechanism named Proof-of-Reserve (PoR) to perform consumer-prosumer transactions and block mining activities on a distributed ledger. The model is numerically analyzed on a test system to illustrate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of game-theoretic modeling in establishing market equilibrium and showcase the efficiency of blockchain technology in facilitating a functional, decentralized transaction settlement process.",

However, its security has also met great challenges, and many security vulnerabilities and attack issues in blockchain-based services have emerged. Recently, security issues of blockchain have attracted extensive attention. However, there is still a lack of blockchain security research from a full-stack architecture perspective, as well as representative quantitative experimental reproduction and analysis. We aim to provide a security architecture to solve security risks in blockchain services from a full-stack architecture perspective. Meanwhile, we propose a formal definition of the full-stack security architecture for blockchain-based services, and we also propose a formal expression of security issues and defense solutions from a full-stack security perspective. We use ConCert to conduct a smart contract formal verification experiment by property-based testing. The security vulnerabilities of blockchain services in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and China Nation Vulnerability Database (CNVD) are selected and enumerated. Additionally, three real contract-layer real attack events are reproduced by an experimental approach. Using Alibaba's blockchain services and Identity Mixer in Hyperledger Fabric as a case study, the security problems and defense techniques are analyzed and researched. At last, the future research directions are proposed.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (181KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a fast growing technology that autonomously connects things, allowing for exchange of information depending on relationships. However, the open nature of SIoT exposes it to various security challenges, such as default passwords, brute-forcing attacks, data privacy breaches, and an increasing number of IoT botnets. To address these vulnerabilities, a novel operational security framework for SIoT, leveraging the robust properties of blockchain technology. The primary objectives of the operational security model are to establish a secure and trusted environment in SIoT, protect sensitive data, ensure reliable device authentication, and enable secure and encrypted communication in SIoT operations. The proposed model combines key features of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, transparency, and cryptographic mechanisms, with SIoT security operations. Techniques like encryption, anonymization and differential privacy are employed to preserve privacy in SIoT devices and safeguard sensitive data. An empirical assessment of this operational security framework yields promising outcomes in the pursuit of its defined objectives. It furnishes a decentralized and tamper-proof foundation for device authentication, thereby cementing the trustworthiness of SIoT devices. Moreover, the proposed Graph Neural Network (GNN) model eclipses the performance of traditional models, boasting a 95% accuracy, a 96% precision, a 95% recall, and a 95% F1-score. This achievement can be attributed to the incorporation of computations that encapsulate both transitivity and composability among devices. In tandem, the suggested framework emerges triumphant when compared to other methodologies, spanning diverse metrics such as throughput, latency, security score, privacy score, and trust score. Notably, this framework not only secures communication but also upholds data integrity and confidentiality, ensuring exclusive access to SIoT devices and data by authorized entities. The proposed SIoT framework, with 280 Tx/s throughput, 2.2 seconds latency, 9.5 security score, 9.0 privacy score, and 9.5 trust score, outperforms other authorsâ models across all the parameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nOver the past decade, the blockchain technology has gained a significant traction with the introduction of the âbitcoinâ, the first cryptocurrency back in 2008. The rapid growth of âbitcoinâ as a currency and the Bitcoin as a protocol has served as a wake-up call to the IT community which began to realize the real potential of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is capable of filling many gaps that traditional IT solutions struggle to address. In the other hand the increasing complexity of adjudicating health insurance claims is an urge to introduce more secure and efficient claims adjudication system. Blockchain technology has the potential to reshape the claims adjudication process not only due to its decentralized and tamper-proof features but to its consensus protocols and much more other characteristics. This article studies some of the most recent researches on blockchain solution for health insurance claim adjudication, evaluates the its feasibility and identifies areas where blockchain technology could be applied to improve efficiency and accuracy. This study will also examine the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a blockchain-based system, like reducing administrative costs and improving fraud detection.",

    "abstract": "These days, data is regarded as a valuable asset in the era of the data economy, which demands a trading platform for buying and selling data. However, online data trading poses challenges in terms of security and fairness because the seller and the buyer may not fully trust each other. Therefore, in this paper, a blockchain-based secure and fair data trading system is proposed by taking advantage of the smart contract and matchmaking encryption. The proposed system enables bilateral authorization, where data trading between a seller and a buyer is accomplished only if their policies, required by each other, are satisfied simultaneously. This can be achieved by exploiting the security features of the matchmaking encryption. To guarantee non-repudiation and fairness between trading parties, the proposed system leverages a smart contract to ensure that the parties honestly carry out the data trading protocol. However, the smart contract in the proposed system does not include complex cryptographic operations for the efficiency of on-chain processes. Instead, these operations are carried out by off-chain parties and their results are used as input for the on-chain procedure. The system also uses an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes based on the trading proof recorded on the blockchain. The performance of the protocol is evaluated in terms of off-chain computation overhead and on-chain gas consumption. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocols can enable the implementation of a cost-effective data trading system.",

This research aims to study the underlying factors that build resistance toward blockchain among retailers. The study has used innovation resistance theory (IRT) and the dynamic capability model to build the conceptual model. The study used a single cross-sectional design to investigate the proposed model with data collected from 360 retailers. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling estimated with the maximum likelihood model. The study's results showed that the threat of data ownership is the most significant factor that builds resistance towards blockchain, followed by threat severity. The results also showed that managerial capability and innovation capability could indirectly influence the relationship of IRT variables to resistance towards blockchain. The research extends the knowledge in the blockchain and contributes to relevant literature and business practitioners concerned with the results.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nA flexible execution of multi-party business processes on blockchain.\nâ¢\nFlexibility is supported by an architecture based on off- and on-chain components.\nâ¢\nThe prototype implementation relies on the Ethereum blockchain and on Drools engine.\nAbstract\nIn modern business scenarios, more and more organisations have to deal with the critical requirements of trustworthiness and flexibility, when collaborating in multi-party business processes. This calls for new kinds of systems able to manage collaborative processes in untrusted and dynamic environments. Concerning the collaborative perspective, the Business Process Management discipline has provided effective and standardised solutions for a long time, now. Regarding the trustworthiness perspective, blockchain is advocated as one of the most prominent technologies to guarantee trust in a multi-party setting. However, while the immutability of blockchain provides transparent and secure proof of past business interactions, it hinders the flexibility of the business process execution, as the business logic regulating the process execution is immutably stored in the blockchain. On the other hand, flexibility is a property that is becoming crucial in such a setting due to the high dynamism of the business scenarios. In fact, it permits to modify a process at run-time to deal with internal or external changes. In this paper, we face this issue by proposing an architecture for the flexible blockchain-based execution of multi-party business processes. In our approach, business processes are modelled by BPMN choreography diagrams translated into code, whose execution state is then stored in the blockchain. Flexibility is achieved by decoupling the business processâs logic from its execution state, thus allowing run-time changes to the process execution without losing the fundamental properties of trust provided by the blockchain. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we provide a prototypical implementation, called FlexChain, and we use it on a case study from the healthcare application domain. The results obtained by the analysis of cost for the reported case study show the feasibility of the approach. In particular, major costs to sustain relate to one-time operations, such as the deployment and the run-time update of the model, while the most frequent actions are quite efficient.",

This culture is further compounded by a âlinear workflowâ that often results in low efficiency, delays, rework and unnecessary waste. Blockchain technology can help to mitigate these issues by creating a decentralised and transparent system, where all the actors can have access to a shared database, it allows tracking and monitors the different stages of the project, and even automate some processes increasing efficiency and reducing delays and rework.\nThis study highlights the advantages of Blockchain technology, particularly how it can provide a single source of truth for project data while allowing multiple parties to access and share data in a secure and transparent way, improving the workflow of BIM projects and decreasing the likelihood of errors, mistakes, or fraudulent activities. The paper explores the integration of BIM and Blockchain across life cycle and supply chains based on the RIBA plan of work, with the objective to streamline collaboration while improving process efficiency and resource traceability in projects. The study proposes a roadmap performing a detailed literature survey for Blockchain adoption in the construction industry, and validated on a real-world Bridge project. Furthermore, this study is innovative since it examines the integration of BIM and Blockchain throughout the entire project lifecycle by simulating the smart contract implementation based on the RIBA plan of work, thus providing an in-depth examination of the potential benefits of this integration.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (290KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Drawing on contingency theory, the study investigates the moderating effect of market turbulence. The data were collected from 204 SMEs in Malaysiaâs manufacturing sector and analysed using the partial least squares technique. The results showed that the intention of SMEsâ managers to adopt blockchain is influenced by the contributions of blockchain to supply chain transparency and agility. Supply chain transparency, alignment, adaptability, and agility are interrelated. Market turbulence moderates positively the association between agility and intention to adopt blockchain. This study extends the literature by decomposing the concept of relative advantages and investigating the influences of blockchain benefits on blockchain adoption. The moderating effect of market turbulence indicates that the influence of blockchain on agility is more important for SMEs operating in a turbulent environment than the SMEs in a stable market. The findings help the policymakers and blockchain vendors in developing effective plans and strategies to speed up the adoption of blockchain among SMEs. Furthermore, the results give confidence to the managers and owners of SMEs that blockchain can be a valuable competitive advantage source.",

This article contributes to this emerging body of work by considering how to use blockchain to enable sustainable food supply chains. To advance the use of blockchain for sustainability in the food supply chain context, this study proposes a blockchain-enabled architectural framework for trustworthy communication about the sustainability attributes of food products. The blockchain-enabled architectural framework outlines a multi-layered architecture for utilising blockchain-based traceability as a way to signal to consumers the trustworthy sustainability attributes of a particular food product. This kind of sustainability communication enables the accessibility of traceable and verifiable evidence and therefore can significantly enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of sustainable claims/credentials compared to printed food labels or other digital means of communication. The study contributes to sustainability communication empowered by blockchain-based traceability and offers invaluable insights to both researchers and practitioners in the industry 4.0 landscape.",

    "abstract": "Due to its decentralized, tamper-proof, and trust-free characteristics, blockchain is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) to guarantee the reliability of data. However, some technical flaws in blockchain itself prevent the development of these applications, such as the issue with linearly growing storage capacity of blockchain systems. On the other hand, there is a lack of storage resources for sensor devices in IoT, and numerous sensor devices will generate massive data at ultra-high speed, which makes the storage problem of the IoT enabled by blockchain more prominent. There are various solutions to reduce the storage burden by modifying the blockchainâs storage policy, but most of them do not consider the willingness of peers. In attempt to make the blockchain more compatible with the IoT, this paper proposes a storage optimization scheme that revisits the system data storage problem from a more practically oriented standpoint. Peers will only store transactional data that they are directly involved in. In addition, a transaction verification model is developed to enable peers to undertake transaction verification with the aid of cloud computing, and an incentive mechanism is premised on the storage optimization scheme to assure data integrity. The results of the simulation experiments demonstrate the proposed schemeâs advantage in terms of storage and throughput.",

Blockchain is a disruptive technology characterised by anonymity and identity, consensus mechanism, decentralisation, overall performance and expectancy, reliability of systems and data, and information transparency. Blockchain offers supply chain opportunities to strengthen end-to-end visibility and traceability, leading to enhanced levels of transparency. Supply chains are increasingly exploring blockchain technology and transparency, with many focusing on system development. This paper explores transparency in blockchain-based supply chains to understand the principles underlining its design. A systematic review of literature is used, accompanied by data-driven analysis. The results present the principles within a framework for transparency by design in blockchain-based supply chains. Limitations and areas for future work are also presented.",

Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling makerâs revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (235KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nConstruction waste management (CWM) and blockchain technology (BT) are two crucial topics for sustainable production and development. As a fundamental infrastructure for artificial intelligence, BT enables real-time, reciprocal, and immutable information provision in tracing construction waste and holds a significant potential to advance CWM. However, the barriers to adopting BT in CWM and their impact on CWM practices remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to identify BT adoption barriers in CWM, assess their criticality, and clarify their correlations through a fuzzy empirical analysis. Results show that, due to interdependence, actions on one or some of the barriers can have a closed-loop impact. The findings suggest that the government and the stakeholders have a critical influence on the further adoption of BT in CWM. This exploratory study advances sustainable construction by clarifying those BT adoption barriers and providing implications to integrate BT into CWM practices.",

The article contributes conceptually and empirically to a systemic vision of blockchain to sort out climate change challenges and clean energy transition and simultaneously increase the productivity and efficiency of good practices. This vision covers the popularization of ecological initiatives, waste reduction, organization of sustainable investments, control over responsibilities on both fighting and forecasting climate change and clean energy transition. By embracing the notion of blockchain as a problem-solving tool for climate change and clean energy transition, the paper draws and investigates the experiences of the 36 digitally developed and 25 digitally developing economies. It also examines the effectiveness of alternative practices in Industry 4.0. The paper's findings represent a systematic vision of implementing blockchain initiatives to solve climate change and clean energy transition. An energy-efficient model with a blockchain opens up massive opportunities for ecological monitoring, supports energy transition and ameliorates economic sustainability. Since the blockchain potential is not fully unlocked, a model expanding the use of blockchain in education to train green personnel and in science to support climate innovations is proposed.",

The permissionless blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the performance bottleneck of consensus protocols. With recent advances in consensus protocols, the execution and validation of transactions have become the new performance bottleneck.\nWe propose a novel framework, called FastBlock, to speed up the execution and validation steps by introducing fine-grained concurrency. Our early design of FastBlock supported three key modules: (1) a symbolic execution-based analyzer that automatically identifies minimal atomic sections in each transaction; (2) a concurrent execution step that executes possibly conflicting transactions in parallel using hardware transactional memory; (3) a concurrent validation step that introduces a happen-before relation to deterministically re-execute transactions.\nThe improved FastBlock presented in this article supports the nonce mechanism to schedule concurrent transactions from the same account. Moreover, we empirically study the impact of concurrency on Ethereum except for performance and shed light on potential optimizations of FastBlock. Finally, we implemented FastBlock and then evaluated the performance of FastBlock. Our result shows that the FastBlock outperforms state-of-art solutions significantly in performance: the execution step and validation step speed up to 3.0x and 2.3x on average over the original serial model, respectively, with eight concurrent threads. In addition, we evaluated the impact of the nonce mechanism, and the result shows that the performance loss caused by this mechanism is acceptable in practice.",

    "abstract": "Trustworthiness and product traceability are essential factors in the apparel industry 4.0 for establishing successful business relationships among stakeholders such as customers, manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has implemented different technology-based systems to record and track product transactions. However, these systems work in silos, and there is no intra-system communication, leading to a lack of complete supply chain traceability for all apparel stakeholders. Moreover, apparel stakeholders are reluctant to share their business information with business competitors; thus, they involve third-party auditors to ensure the quality of the final product. Furthermore, the apparel manufacturing industry faces challenges with counterfeit products, making it difficult for consumers to determine the authenticity of the products. Therefore, in this paper, a trustworthy apparel product traceability framework called ChainApparel is developed using the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to address these challenges of authenticity and traceability of apparel products. Specifically, multiple smart contracts are designed and developed for registration, process execution, audit, fault, and product traceability to authorize, validate, and trace every business transaction among the apparel stakeholders. Further, the real-time performance analysis of ChainApparel is carried out regarding transaction throughput and latency by deploying the compute nodes at different geographical locations using Hyperledger Fabric. The results conclude that ChainApparel accomplished significant performance under diverse workloads while ensuring complete traceability along the complex supply chain of the apparel industry. Thus, the ChainApparel framework helps make the apparel product more trustworthy and transparent in the market while safeguarding trust among the industry stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology is taking centre stage in major industries, ushering in a new era of decentralisation and digitalisation. While blockchain has garnered widespread traction in various sectors, there remain many technological, operational, societal, and legal challenges in deploying blockchain, mainly attributable to its sheer novelty. With ensuing ruminations about data protection concerns and given the real threats posed by the increasing usage of blockchain, scholars have examined these underlying challenges faced by blockchain users and regulators globally. Trust-building issues, such as data protection breaches, warrant our attention due to the negative consequences that may manifest and concretise in any measurable manner, triggering fragmentation of blockchain-based applications and socio-technical assemblages. This paper proposes eight data protection indicators (DPIs) to assess the maturity levels of countries in addressing data protection challenges in the blockchain landscape. The DPIs can contribute to developing institutional and governance frameworks to spur the global diffusion of hard and soft law instruments and establish broader safeguards of blockchain usersâ data.",

Although blockchain improves the cross-institution data sharing ability, there still exist the problems of authentication difficulty and privacy leakage. This paper first describes the architecture of the BIoMT system and designs an anonymous authentication model for medical data sharing. This BIoMT system is divided into four layers: perceptual, network, platform, and application. The model integrates an anonymous authentication scheme to guarantee secure data sharing in the network ledger. Utilizing the untampered blockchain ledger can protect the privacy of medical data and system users. Then, an anonymous authentication scheme called the group blind signature (GBS) scheme is designed. This scheme can provide anonymity for the signer as that one member can represent the group to sign without exposing his identity. The blind property also can protect the message from being signed as it is anonymous to the signer. Moreover, this GBS scheme is created with the lattice assumption, which makes it more secure against quantum attacks. In addition, the security proof shows that this GBS scheme can achieve the security properties of dynamical-almost-full anonymity, blindness, traceability, and non-frameability. The comparison analysis and performance evaluation of key size show that this GBS scheme is more efficient than similar schemes in other literature.",

However, one major drawback of blockchain investments is their substantial energy consumption, which has negative impacts on both the economy and the environment. The main cause of concern is the generation of atmospheric carbon emissions resulting from excessive energy usage. This research study aims to identify blockchain networks and systems that assert themselves as environmentally friendly and determine which of them produces the least amount of carbon emissions, such as Cardano, Tezos, and Bitgreen. This has been accomplished by following a comprehensive hybrid literature review. Our study has identified 23 blockchain networks that consume significantly less power and release fewer carbon dioxide emissions compared to the Bitcoin network. Some of these environmentally friendly networks include Algorand, Fantom, MobileCoin, and Electroneum. Additionally, we have found various projects and organizations that support greener blockchain initiatives, such as the Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism, Green Digital Finance Alliance, GreenTrust, and the Energy Web Foundation. While several projects in this area have been recognized and examined, comprehensive research and analysis are still needed to provide empirical evidence regarding the power consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of these claimed environmentally friendly blockchains. This is due to the relatively early stage of development in this field.",

    "abstract": "Cloud storage and edge computing are utilized to address the storage and computational challenges arising from the exponential data growth in IoT. However, data privacy is potentially risky when data is outsourced to cloud servers or edge services. While data encryption ensures data confidentiality, it can impede data sharing and retrieval. Attribute-based searchable encryption (ABSE) is proposed as an effective technique for enhancing data security and privacy. Nevertheless, ABSE has its limitations, such as single attribute authorization failure, privacy leakage during the search process, and high decryption overhead. This paper presents a novel approach called the blockchain-assisted efficient multi-authority attribute-based searchable encryption scheme (BEM-ABSE) for cloud-edge collaboration scenarios to address these issues. BEM-ABSE leverages a consortium blockchain to replace the central authentication center for global public parameter management. It incorporates smart contracts to facilitate reliable and fair ciphertext keyword search and decryption result verification. To minimize the computing burden on resource-constrained devices, BEM-ABSE adopts an online/offline hybrid mechanism during the encryption process and a verifiable edge-assisted decryption mechanism. This ensures both low computation cost and reliable ciphertext. Security analysis conducted under the random oracle model demonstrates that BEM-ABSE is resistant to indistinguishable chosen keyword attacks (IND-CKA) and indistinguishable chosen plaintext attacks (IND-CPA). Theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm that BEM-ABSE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, the discovery of new technologies is more intense than ever before. Terms such as Blockchain technology or Smart Contracts are becoming more and more familiar. Thanks to the decentralized system and the distribution of immutable records of transactions among all network participants, Blockchain finds application in almost any field, whether industry or society. Supply chain is one such area. In this paper, a theoretical model of supply chain based on Blockchain is presented. The participants of the presented model are the manufacturer with suppliers, the carrier, the retailer, and the final consumer. The model describes the process from the production of components to the sale of the final product to the final consumer. By implementing RFID and IoT, the participants can track the goods in real time. The end consumer enters the chain by scanning the QR code of the product. Contractual relationships are stored in the Blockchain in the form of Smart Contracts, which automatically execute the action based on the agreed terms. In addition, the paper describes selected Blockchain platforms that are used in the real world. Finally, we also present tools for simulating and testing Blockchain in a local network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology has the potential to be applied widely in supply chain operations. One such area is proactive supply chain risk management (SCRM). In this area, existing researchers have highlighted the fraudulent behaviour of supply chain partners who do not disclose information on the risks that impact their operations. Blockchain can address this problem by encoding each partnerâs commitment to SCRM and achieve consensus. However, before this can be achieved, a key challenge to address is the inability of existing consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to deal with information that does not have a digital footprint. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing the Proof by Earnestness (PoE) consensus mechanism which accounts for the authenticity, legitimacy and trustworthiness of information that does not have a digital footprint. We also propose the Subjective Information Authenticity Earnestness Framework (SIAEF) as the overarching framework that assists PoE in achieving its aim. We test the applicability of SIAEF and PoE in a real-world blockchain environment by deploying it as a decentralized application (Dapp) and applying it in BscScan Testnet which is an official test blockchain network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLongstanding assumptions underlying strategic alliances, such as agency theory, are actively being revoked by dynamics in the new economy. The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel âBlockchain Agency Theoryâ that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike.",

These devices can be from multiple manufacturers which makes their use in terms of data acquisition, processing, analysis and actions on these data challenging. Additionally, all these data must be analyzed and correlated in real time for the early detection of situations of interest (complex events) and subsequent decision making. These complex events must be able to automatically trigger decisions and be stored in a secure, immutable and accessible way. In this context, Event-Driven Applications (EDAs) are a solution to meet these needs, however, developing such applications requires vast knowledge in certain technologies. To address these challenges, an EDA is proposed in this paper to integrate Complex Event Processing (CEP) and blockchain through the low-code paradigm. This proposal allows for the development of EDAs in a user-friendly way. These applications make it possible to integrate IoT devices from multiple manufacturers and with different data formats together with CEP technology for complex event detection and blockchain for secure, immutable and accessible event storage. To demonstrate the feasibility, the architecture was applied and evaluated in a case study related to measuring and acting on air quality using IoT devices that measure different pollutants and factors such as temperature, humidity and wind. The results show that the graphically designed EDAs facilitate the real-time analysis of the collected IoT data via a CEP engine, whose outcome is transparently and automatically registered in a blockchain network.",

    "abstract": "Pandemics have always been a nightmare for humanity, especially in developing countries. Forced lockdowns are considered one of the effective ways to deal with spreading such pandemics. Still, developing countries cannot afford such solutions because these may severely damage the countryâs economy. Therefore, this study presents the proactive technological mechanisms for business organizations to run their standard business processes during pandemic-like situations smoothly. The novelty of this study is to provide a state-of-the-art solution to prevent pandemics using industrial internet of things (IIoT) and blockchain-enabled technologies. Compared to existing studies, the immutable and tamper-proof contact tracing and quarantine management solution is proposed. The use of advanced technologies and information security is a critical area for practitioners in the internet of things (IoT) and corresponding solutions. Therefore, this study also emphasizes information security, end-to-end solution, and experimental results. Firstly, a wearable wristband is proposed, incorporating 4G-enabled ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for smart contact tracing mechanisms in industries to comply with standard operating procedures outlined by the world health organization (WHO). Secondly, distributed ledger technology (DLT) omits the centralized dependency for transmitting contact tracing data. Thirdly, a privacy-preserving tracing mechanism is discussed using a public/private key cryptography-based authentication mechanism. Lastly, based on geofencing techniques, blockchain-enabled machine-to-machine (M2M) technology is proposed for quarantine management. The step-by-step methodology and test results are proposed to ensure contact tracing and quarantine management. Unlike existing research studies, the security aspect is also considered in the realm of blockchain. The practical implementation of the proposed solution also obtains the results. The results indicate the successful implementation of blockchain-enabled contact tracing and isolation management using IoT and geo-fencing techniques, which could help battle pandemic situations. Researchers can also consider the 5G-enabled narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT) technologies to implement contact tracing solutions.",

Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of the four BEAs: smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, play-to-earn games, and non-fungible tokens. These BEAs have implications for the marketing field as they affect consumers and brands. We propose a novel theoretical framework that articulates how the principles that underpin BEAs can impact consumers and then explains how brands can use BEAs to innovate their products and services. The core principles of blockchain technology, as well as enhanced digital connectivity, imply that consumers can become more in control of their data and privacy rights, responsible for their choices, and digitally connected. To cater to consumers, brands can use BEAs to roll out technology-focused service innovations, customer-focused service innovations, and product innovations. Based on this perspective, we then advance ten future research questions. This article aims to advance the nascent field of blockchain in marketing.",

The CNN-LSTM model is designed to efficiently extract and process data from diverse sources, thereby addressing the issue of data modality.\nâ¢\nWe devise the cross-platform runtime environment based on Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. This environment allows for the seamless processing of diverse data sources and types through heterogeneous computing nodes in IIoWT. By leveraging MQTT, the devised runtime environment ensures interoperability and facilitates the execution of data across heterogeneous computing nodes.\nâ¢\nWe devise a blockchain scheme that utilizes SHA-256 for data hashing. This scheme incorporates a proof-of-work mechanism and ensures data validity across heterogeneous nodes in IIoWT.\nIntroduction:\nThe Industrial Internet of Water Things (IIoWT) has recently emerged as a leading architecture for efficient water distribution in smart cities. Its primary purpose is to ensure high-quality drinking water for various institutions and households. However, existing IIoWT architecture has many challenges. One of the paramount challenges in achieving data standardization and data fusion across multiple monitoring institutions responsible for assessing water quality and quantity.\nObjective:\nThis paper introduces the Industrial Internet of Water Things System for Data Standardization based on Blockchain and Digital Twin Technology. The main objective of this study is to design a new IIoWT architecture where data standardization, interoperability, and data security among different water institutions must be met.\nMethods:\nWe devise the digital twin-enabled cross-platform environment using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to achieve seamless interoperability in heterogeneous computing. In water management, we encounter different types of data from various sensors. Therefore, we propose a CNN-LSTM and blockchain data transactional (BCDT) scheme for processing valid data across different nodes.\nResults:\nThrough simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed IIoWT architecture significantly reduces processing time while improving the accuracy of data standardization within the water distribution management system.\nConclusion:\nOverall, this paper presents a comprehensive approach to tackle the challenges of data standardization and security in the IIoWT architecture.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (182KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

This paper proposes the adoption of a framework based on Hybrid Distributed Ledger Technology (Hybrid-DLT) as a technological solution for improving trustworthiness. We detail three specific applications in the sector of critical infrastructure maintenance: Explainable AI (XAI) for risk classification, structural defects recognition, and real-time monitoring through IoT. The proposed approach employs tamper-resistant ledgers for tracking key processes such as dataset collection, model training, and inference generation, thereby ensuring non-repudiability for recorded actions and enabling auditability. We demonstrate how this strengthens the explainability mechanisms of AI models and enables the production of verifiable data lineage and certified inferences. Our framework can be applied to existing AI solutions, enhancing their trustworthiness.",

Such a gap exists mainly in the rest of the U.S. by the fact that patients' electronic health records are scattered across multiple health care facilities and often not shared due to privacy, security, and business interests concerns from both patients and health care organizations. In addition, patients have ethical concerns related to consent. To patients, data security, privacy, and consent are based on trustfulness, rather than patientsâ engagement in ensuring only authorized people can view their PHRs with patient-managed granularity. Resolving these challenges is an important step in making longitudinal PHR useful for patient care.\nObjective\nThis research aims to design and implement a blockchain-enabled sharing platform prototype for PHR with desired patient-controlled data security, privacy, and consent granularity.\nMethods\nBuilt upon our prior work of a blockchain-enabled access control (BAC) model, we design a blockchain-enabled sharing platform for PHR with patient-controlled security, privacy, and consent granularity. We further implement the construct by building a prototypical platform among a patient and two typical health care organizations. Health organizations that hold the patient's electronic health records can join the platform with trust based on the validation from the patient. The mutual trust can be established through a rigorous validation process by both the patient and the built-in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain consensus mechanism.\nResults\nWe proposed a system trusted by patients and health care providers and constructed a Web-based PHR sharing platform with patient-controlled security, privacy, and consent granularity. We analyzed the system scalability in three aspects and showed millisecond range of performance when simultaneously changing access permissions on hundreds of PHRs. Consent, security and privacy of the model are ensured by the merits of the BAC model. We discovered the current blockchain model limits the system scalability due to using a non-graphical database. A new graphical database is suggested for future improvements.\nConclusions\nIn this research, we report a solution to electronically sharing and managing patientsâ electronic health records originating from multiple organizations, focusing on privacy, security, and granularity control of consent in the U.S. Specifically, the system protects data security and privacy, and provides auditability, scalability, distributedness, patient consent autonomy, and zero-trust capabilities. The prototypical instantiation of the designed model suggested the feasibility of combining emerging blockchain technology with next generation access control model to tackle a longstanding longitudinal PHR problem.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe supply chain of rare earth metals plays a crucial role in producing thin-film solar photovoltaics (PVs), which are vital for renewable energy generation. However, this supply chain is often characterized by opacity, inefficiencies, and security concerns especially since those rare earth metals come from mainly one supplier, China. Also, the solar PVsâ certificates are purely technical and fail to consider the ethical sourcing and sustainable supply chain management conditions of mining. The working conditions of the miners are often neglected and are least prioritized. In this paper, a blockchain-based solution was proposed to leverage the intrinsic decentralized blockchain features including traceability, transparency, non-repudiation, and accountability in the supply chain of thin-film solar PVs, to safeguard not only the technical conditions of the mined products but also the ethical conditions of the workers during mining. Ethical mines must uphold good safety standards, pay their workers a fair wage, adhere to working hours, and legal working age. The solution paves the way to ethical mining where the certification of the PVs is not granted unless both technical and ethical conditions are met. The supply chain of thin-film PVs that goes from mining the rare earth metals in China, where more than 70% of the rare earth metals used are extracted from, to the disposal at the end-of-life (EOL) of the PVs was presented. Smart contracts to enable the on-chain traceability of the registration, manufacturing, assessment, delivery, and disposal of PVs were developed. The solution exploits the tamper-proof logs of the distributed ledger to ensure accountability and record transactions as part of the data provenance. The proposed solution includes a system design with sequence diagrams, smart contracts with algorithms, and a testing and analysis section.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe importance of traceability in food products in regard to consumer preferences, the difficulty of certifications in communicating credence attributes, and concerns about food safety, have led consumers to ask for more information about the credibility of information reported on the label with the product itself, due to the importance of traceability in food products. An objective of this study is to analyze the benefits of implementing blockchain technology in the supply chain for ancient wheat, as a technology capable of sharing reliable information about the products easily along the entire value chain. In particular, the aim is to evaluate how the consumer reacts when confronted with a package of ancient wheat pasta for which all the information on its origin and processing methods is available. In order to achieve these results, a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model has been developed and conducted in the Italian country. Result indicates the importance of identifying an independent variable that represents the degree of security when faced with a threat that creates a circumstance, condition or event that can lead to economic hardship, for example, data destruction, disclosure, modification, fraud, waste, and abuse. The strength of blockchain lies precisely in its ability to guarantee the immutability of data throughout the supply chain, providing the end consumer with a high-quality product.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNew digital technologies generate large amounts of information. This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the usersâ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjectsâ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPRâs legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.",

The article presents a technique for creating a blockchain-based, integrated identification system in a marketplace by automating and decentralizing the creation and auditing of strong and secure attributes. When individuals engage in market transactions, they act as nodes in a distributed blockchain network, contributing to the development of federated identities. Using a single federated identity, members of this network are able to use any of the participating companies' services. In this, IoT sensors and wearables can automatically log real-time data for you while identifying patterns and flagging problems. The total transparency of all blockchain transactions provides participants the ability to see which services they're using and their users the ability to track the usage of their identities.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain is a leading-edge technology that has received great public attention in the past few years. Due to its eccentric features i.e. transparency, immutability and decentralization, blockchain intends to targets any domain that deals with transactional data. In production sectors, significant efforts are in progress to make use of this disruptive technology for efficient collaboration among stakeholders and management of their products lifecycles. However, despite positive feedback and great aspiration, certain challenges still exist over which the executive level management has great concern. In this regard, this study tries to highlight and focus on what are the potential challenges in blockchain technology adoption? and provide recommendations for how organization can address those challenges? Initially, we elaborate and classify the potential challenges into two categories i.e. key challenges specific to blockchain adoption in PLM and some further challenges that are generic in nature and applicable to most of the applications of blockchain. The study then scientifically argues for potential directions and solutions to address the key challenges. Afterward, the general-purpose challenges are explored and broken down into four different aspects i.e. technical, organizational, environmental & social, and financial challenges. It is emphasized that both internal and external level decisions are need of the day to address these challenges. Finally, the evolution of a new era i.e. blockchain 5.0, its aims and capabilities to overcome the existing technical concerns has been discussed. Multiple Industrial sectors can follow the recommendation presented in this paper to setup their own secure and full-fledged blockchain-based PLM systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the rapid increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, massive amounts of sensitive IoT data are being generated and transmitted over the Internet. Despite its growing adoption in various fields, IoT security remains a major challenge requiring further research. IoT authentication is an essential security mechanism for building trust in IoT systems. However, conventional authentication approaches use expensive cryptographic primitives that do not align with the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices. Furthermore, centralized authentication schemes have proven to be inapplicable for cross-domain authentication and do not limit the scalability of IoT networks. Recently, blockchain technology has been applied to building decentralized authentication between IoT devices. Nevertheless, most existing blockchain-based authentication approaches incur high overhead in IoT computation, storage, and energy consumption. Authentication time is another critical issue in real-time IoT systems. When numerous IoT authentication requests are transferred to the blockchain, an additional time delay is imposed, in addition to the high computational cost of the blockchain caused by the consensus mechanism. This study proposes a hybrid centralized and blockchain-based authentication architecture for IoT systems. Edge servers are deployed to provide centralized authentication for associated IoT devices. A blockchain network of centralized edge servers is then established to ensure decentralized authentication and verification of IoT devices that belong to different and heterogeneous IoT systems. Lightweight cryptographic methods are implemented to achieve efficient authentication, in which limiting the consumption of IoT resources is required. The architecture is demonstrated using a local Ethereum blockchain network. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in terms of computation cost, execution time, and power consumption for IoT compared with centralized and blockchain-based authentication schemes. A security analysis proves the ability of our architecture to mitigate attacks and satisfy the IoT security requirements.",

Although a large body of blockchain research has been conducted in various fields, little is known about press perspectives on adopting blockchain in journalism. This study explores the determinants of applying blockchain in journalism activities in Vietnam. Based on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and previous research, we surveyed 287 people working at press agencies in Vietnam. The results from testing nine research hypotheses show that five factors, namely Technology Affinity, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Condition, Technology Readiness, and Regulatory Support, positively impact the intention of applying Blockchain in journalism activities in Vietnam. Two factors, namely Performance Expectancy and Trust, were not positively strongly correlated to the use of blockchain. Besides, Regulatory Support is found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between Facilitating Condition and Behavioral Intention.",

As agricultural systems become increasingly connected to the Internet, they provide many new opportunities but also introduce new challenges. Connecting such systems to a network exposes them to cyberattacks and vulnerabilities; therefore, security and privacy are important challenges that should be addressed. Specifically, because of the distinct characteristics of smart farming such as environmental and farm conditions, security solutions suitable for smart farming are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a location verification (LV) protocol as a security solution for autonomous and intelligent moving devices such as drones and robots deployed in smart farming. Moreover, as an application of the proposed LV protocol, we propose a blockchain-based secure drone rental mechanism for smart farming. We present a security analysis in which the proposed LV protocol and rental mechanism are secure against man-in-the-middle, impersonation, modification, replay, and relay attacks, with the rental mechanism providing mutual authentication. Through a performance evaluation of the LV protocol in terms of the communication overhead, computation cost, and storage cost and a performance evaluation of the blockchain for drone rental with regard to throughput and latency, we confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the LV protocol and drone rental mechanism in the smart farming.",

However, centralized evidence gathering and maintenance reduces the credibility of digital evidence. This article suggests a unique digital forensic architecture for the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud combining rapidly expanding Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain technologies to address this serious issue. Blockchain helps to store the gathered evidence, which means it is shared among many peers in the proposed forensic architecture. The Secure-Ring-Verification-based Authentication (SRVA) technique is recommended to ensure security from suspicious accounts. The Harmony Search Optimization (HSO) technique helps to produce secret keys that strengthen the cloud environment. Depending on their level of sensitivity, all information is encrypted and kept on a cloud server. Sensitive Aware Deep Elliptic Curve Cryptography (SAD-ECC) method was used for encryption. In the cloud, a piece of information is saved, and the SDN manager creates the blocks and stores the history of that piece of data as metadata. Utilizing Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3), a Merkle Hash Tree is constructed for each block. The proposed technology uses Fuzzy-based Smart Contracts (FSCs) to enable clients to trail their data. At last, evidence analysis is made possible by creating a Logical-Graph of Evidence (LGoE) using data collected through Blockchain. The network simulator-3.26 and java (for cloud and Blockchain) environment are used for experiments. A thorough investigation shows that the suggested forensic architecture exhibits favorable response, evidence insertion, and verification times.",

It includes four smart contracts on a private-permissioned blockchain network for supply chain traceability and counterfeit detection of COVID-19 vaccine, more specifically to (i) handle the rules and regulations of vaccine importing countries and provide authorization for cross the borders (regulatory compliance and border authorization smart contract), (ii) register new and imported vaccines in the Vacledger system (vaccine registration smart contract), (iii) find the number of stocks that have arrived in the Vacledger system (stock accumulation smart contract), and (iv) identify the exact location of the stock (location tracing update smart contract). Our results show that the proposed system keeps track of all activities, events, transactions, and all other past transactions, permanently stored in an immutable Vacledger connected to decentralized peer-to-peer file systems. We observe no algorithm complexity differences between the proposed Vacledger system and existing supply chain frameworks based on different blockchain types. In addition, based on four use cases, we estimate our modelâs overall gasoline cost (transaction or gas price). The Vacledger system empowers distribution companies to manage their supply chain operations effectively and securely using an in-network, permissioned distributed network. This study employs the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain (the healthcare industry) to demonstrate how the proposed Vacledger system operates. Despite this, our proposed approach might be implemented in other supply chain industries, such as the food industry, energy trading, and commodity transactions.",

The purpose is to investigate how blockchain technology can improve transparency and trust in accounting practice and how professionals can use blockchain data to improve decision-making, based on the qualities of immutability, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) blockchain data. The multi-party validation of blockchain protocols adds real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efficiency. This review summarizes four themes emerging from the literature focusing on how blockchain technology has changed record-keeping in accounting: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry-accounting and continuous auditing. The research interprets the findings using agency theory and stakeholder theory to advance how using blockchain to mitigate information asymmetry and improve stakeholder collaborations is understood. The investigation also summarizes the challenges and clarifies organizationsâ reasons to be cautious about adopting blockchain. Lastly, the study suggests that future researchers use this study in two ways that enrich blockchain literature: first, to apply the themes and answer the questions identified within this review to improve the business methods of practitioners and policymakers; and second, to encourage stakeholders such as practitioners, system designers/developers, and policymakers to collaborate in designing blockchain ecosystems that suit accounting and auditing as they transform digitally.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, blockchain has evolved as a promising solution to develop secure distributed ledgers and has gained massive attention. However, current blockchain systems face the problems of limited throughput, poor scalability, and high latency. Due to the failure of consensus algorithms in managing nodesâ identities, blockchain technology is considered inappropriate for many applications, e.g., in IoT environments, because of poor scalability. This paper proposes a blockchain consensus mechanism called the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to improve blockchain scalability and throughput. The ADR protocol uses the directed acyclic graph ledger, where nodes are placed according to their ranking positions in the graph. It allows honest nodes to use the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to write blocks and verify transactions instead of a chain of blocks. By using a three-step strategy, this protocol ensures that the system is secured against double-spending attacks and allows for higher throughput and scalability. The first step involves the safe entry of nodes into the system by verifying their private and public keys. The next step involves developing an advanced DAG ledger so nodes can start block production and verify transactions. In the third step, a ranking algorithm is developed to separate the nodes created by attackers. After eliminating attacker nodes, the nodes are ranked according to their performance in the system, and true nodes are arranged in blocks in topological order. As a result, the ADR protocol is suitable for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). We evaluated ADR on EC2 clusters with more than 100 nodes and achieved better transaction throughput and liveness of the network while adding malicious nodes. Based on the simulation results, this research determined that the transaction's performance was significantly improved over blockchains like Internet of Things Applications (IOTA) and ByteBall.",

    "abstract": "Background\nBlockchain is an emerging technology that enables secure and decentralized approaches to reduce technical risks and governance challenges associated with sharing data. Although blockchain-based solutions have been suggested for sharing health information, it is still unclear whether a suitable incentive mechanism (intrinsic or extrinsic) can be identified to encourage individuals to share their sensitive data for research purposes.\nObjective\nThis study aimed to investigate how important extrinsic incentives are and what type of incentive is the best option in blockchain-based platforms designed for sharing sensitive health information.\nMethods\nIn this study, we conducted 3 experiments with 493 individuals to investigate the role of extrinsic incentives (ie, cryptocurrency, money, and recognition) in data sharing with research organizations.\nResults\nThe findings highlight that offering different incentives is insufficient to encourage individuals to use blockchain technology or to change their perceptions about the technologyâs premise for sharing sensitive health data. The results demonstrate that individuals still attribute serious risks to blockchain-based platforms. Privacy and security concerns, trust issues, lack of knowledge about the technology, lack of public acceptance, and lack of regulations are reported as top risks. In terms of attracting people to use blockchain-based platforms for data sharing in health care, we show that the effects of extrinsic motivations (cryptoincentives, money, and status) are significantly overshadowed by inhibitors to technology use.\nConclusions\nWe suggest that before emphasizing the use of various types of extrinsic incentives, the users must be educated about the capabilities and benefits offered by this technology. Thus, an essential first step for shifting from an institution-based data exchange to a patient-centric data exchange (using blockchain) is addressing technology inhibitors to promote patient-driven data access control. This study shows that extrinsic incentives alone are inadequate to change usersâ perceptions, increase their trust, or encourage them to use technology for sharing health data.",

    "abstract": "The car-hailing platform based on Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology greatly facilitates passengersâ daily car-hailing, enabling drivers to obtain orders more efficiently and obtain more significant benefits. However, to match the driver closest to the passenger, it is often necessary to process the location information of the passenger and driver, which poses a considerable threat to privacy disclosure to the passenger and driver. Targeting these issues, in this paper, by combining blockchain and Paillier homomorphic encryption algorithm, we design a secure blockchain-enabled IoV scheme with privacy protection for online car-hailing. In this scheme, firstly, we propose an encryption scheme based on the lattice. Thus, the location information of passengers and drivers is encrypted in this system. Secondly, by introducing Paillier homomorphic encryption algorithm, the location matching of passengers and drivers is carried out in the ciphertext state to protect their location privacy. At last, blockchain technology is used to record the transactions in online car-hailing, which can provide a security guarantee for passengers and drivers. And we further analyze the security and performance of this scheme. Compared with other schemes, the experimental results show that the proposed scheme can protect the userâs location privacy and have a better performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology provides a novel method for storing information, performing tasks and functions, and establishing trust between participating nodes. Despite the fact that blockchain technology has received significant attention in a variety of application contexts over the last few years, the issue of privacy and security remains the primary focus of blockchain discussions. In Blockchain, the cryptographic hash function is used to secure message blocks and connect blocks in a chain. In summary, each block in the blockchain contains its own block hash as well as a hash of the block before it. This enables them to create a crypto-graphically secure linear chain of blocks. With blockchain technology, there is a new way to store information, carry out tasks and functions, and build trust between the nodes that are taking part. Hash algorithms can be used to make blockchain integration safe, and many of them can solve problems with data integrity and security that arise when using blockchain technology. But they can also have problems with time, lack of resources, and using too much memory. In this study, an algorithm to create a hash based on a chaos key using logistic maps and lightweight cryptography is proposed (hamming bird 2). Hash outputs are tested in terms of time and hardness to guess using cryptanalysis tools. The proposed algorithm has been tested using cryptanalysis site based brute force attacks. The result show that the modified hash cannot identified by site using all cryptanalysis setting that prove the strong of hash generated against attacks.",

This study aimed to understand if blockchain technology can be an enabler tool for developing additive symbiotic networks. A real case study was developed regarding a circular economy ecosystem in which a fused granular fabrication 3D printer is used to valorize polycarbonate waste. The industrial symbiosis network comprised four stakeholders: a manufacturing company that produces polycarbonate waste, a municipality service responsible for the city waste management, a start-up holding the 3D printer, and a non-profit store. It was identified a set of six requirements to adopt the blockchain technology in an additive symbiotic network, bearing in mind the need to have a database to keep track of the properties of the input material for the 3D printer during the exchanges, in addition to the inexistence of mechanisms of trust or cooperation between well-established industries and the additive manufacturing industry. The findings suggested a permissioned blockchain to support the implementation of the additive symbiotic network, namely, to enable the physical transactions (quantity and quality of waste material PC sheets) and monitoring and reporting (additive manufacturing technology knowledge and final product's quantity and price).\nFuture research venues include developing blockchain-based systems that enhance the development of additive symbiotic networks.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (106KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs an emerging information technology, blockchain has aroused extensive discussions around the world and been suggested as a solution to address current issues in supply chain finance (SCF). The Chinese government also attaches great importance to this technology, and many Chinese state-owned enterprises have invested in establishing their own blockchain research and development centres. However, there is a lack of studies on identifying challenges when deploying this technology; theoretical framework and conceptual exposition are also scarcely seen. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and obstacles in the adoption of blockchain technology in SCF. An exploratory case study of a Chinese state-owned enterprise was conducted to build up an initial conceptual framework. Semi-structured interview was applied to collect data from the case firm's employees, top management, and technical specialists. The results of the analysis indicate that in the adoption of blockchain technology, there are technological, operational, and other challenges. From a technological perspective, framework identification, cross-chain interoperability, and data governance are major barriers; whereas, from an operational perspective, the new business process and transformation in the entire supply chain are identified as challenges. Besides, other obstacles such as the elimination of jobs and regulatory issues are also not neglectable. This study contributes to research on blockchain and supply chains by shedding light on the challenges of blockchain adoption through an exploratory case study of a Chinese state-owned enterprise. A conceptual framework was generated as a basis for future research, and the findings also provide insights for companies that may or are planning to adopt blockchain technology.",

Using the Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing method, costs are allocated for six actors: dairy farm, 3PL, wholesaler and three retailers. In addition, the costs of each player are allocated for each supply chain area: logistics, warehouse and order management. The study shows in which areas and for which actors implementing and integrating different technologies is economically suitable. Different procurement policies are modelled for evaluating the cost impacts for each retailer: Economic Order Quantity, Period Order Quantity and Lot for Lot. Moreover, the costs of non-compliant products are assessed in both scenarios. The results show that specific areas such as warehouse management and logistics in the to-be scenario are not economically optimized, however the entire supply chain cost is optimized. The area with positive economic feasibility for all the participants in the supply chain is order management. The combined use of technologies is economically beneficial when the Economic Order Quantity procurement policy is adopted. Finally, in the to-be scenario the non-compliant products management is economically optimized with economic benefits ranging from 8% to 63%.",

At present, centralized solutions based on data centers and cloud storage have problems with data-right confirmation and center trust. A large number of decentralized storage solutions are public systems, in which blockchain technology, as a tool for value exchange, does not solve the problems of data verification and system supervision. We propose a peer-to-peer storage system with identity access, which achieves data validation, cross-organizational data retrieval, trusted authorization, and sharing based on the consortium blockchain. Our solution proposes a peer-to-peer data storage scheme based on the consortium blockchain and a set of identity authentication mechanisms compatible with the consortium blockchain. Based on this, we propose a blockchain-based permission control scheme and a set of retrieval, authorization, and sharing processes. Finally, we implemented and tested the system to prove the feasibility of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEdge Computing as a paradigm, provides services of outsourcing computations to a large number of end users. Since edge nodes are trustless, the integration of sampling-based replication calculation and the blockchain is used to verify the correctness of computation results in a trustless environment. However, the blockchain with the nature of decentralization, is confronted with some problems of high resource consumption, such that the verification with computational overhead cannot be directly deployed on the blockchain. Thus, we propose an accountable verification scheme based on an off-chain block. The off-chain block meets some requirements of Edge Computing, i.e., reduced latency of services, and edge nodes with heterogeneous resources. The off-chain block tries to address two challenges for reliable outsourcing computations: (i) how to generate the block efficiently and securely, and (ii) how to achieve accountable verification. In detail, the block is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph, in which the transactions of computation results and verification reports are updated in full decentralization. The hash of the block is recorded on the blockchain. Moreover, the integration of off-chain verification and on-chain arbitration provides reliable verification. A trust evaluation model achieves accountability for edge nodes. Besides, we conducted the security analysis based on some performance properties. Finally, the Raspberry Pis are leveraged to simulate lightweight edge nodes to prove the scalability of our outsourcing computations. A consortium blockchain with groups is also implemented to reveal the efficiency of blockchain updates of the proposed scheme.",

Along with the emergence of the trend of cryptocurrencies, this development has also resulted in crimes that hit the digital world, such as data leakage and cyber espionage. This threat can be prevented by applying blockchain technology to the database that has been used. Therefore, we need a system that can facilitate the use of blockchain technology and can process data from an existing relational database into a blockchain-based database. The system developed in this study was built with the FastAPI framework that uses the Python programming language and the React framework that uses the Javascript programming language. This system was tested using Katalon and Wireshark software to perform throughput testing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Evaluation of this system is assessed based on the average throughput time and also the results of Wireshark packet capture. The system designed in this research is expected to help overcome interoperability problems when using blockchain and improve relational database integrity. The results of the test show that the system is safe from man-in-the-middle attacks while sending data through API and has a faster throughput time than BigchainDB system by 4.151 seconds.",

Consequently, it has attracted the interest of companies operating in a multitude of sectors. However, due to the number of different blockchain solutions that have emerged in the last few years and their rapid changes, it is challenging for such companies to orient their technological decisions. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the key dimensionsânamely, governance, maturity, support, latency, privacy, interoperability, flexibility, efficiency, resiliency, and scalabilityâof some of the most-used permissioned blockchain platforms. Moreover, we present the results of a performance evaluation considering the following frameworks: Hyperledger Fabric 2.2, Hyperledger Sawtooth 1.2, and ConsenSys Quorum 21.1 (with both the GoQuorum client and the Hyperledger Besu client). The platforms were tested under similar conditions, and official releases were used, such that our findings provide a reference for companies establishing their technological orientation.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nA systematic review of 262 documents uncovers real-life blockchain applications in the real estate sector.\nâ¢\nProvides empirical insights on the theoretical blockchain benefits and challenges for the real estate sector.\nâ¢\nCurrent adoption concentrates in land administration, is small in scale, and usually an add-on layer to existing systems.\nâ¢\nCurrent applications seem to supply some benefits. Most of the theoretical blockchain ideas remain empirically unconfirmed.\nAbstract\nThe real estate sector is often presented as an exemplary field that benefits from practical blockchain applications. The general hypothesis is that, in theory, blockchain could solve some significant challenges the real estate sector is facing, such as nontransparency, inefficiencies, fraud and corruption, high costs, and trust issues. However, the literature focuses on blockchainâs theoretical benefits, challenges, or concepts. This research aims to understand the recent developments in the blockchain literature, specifically in the real estate sector, and to understand the current real-world applications by collecting empirical evidence from blockchain studies. The systematic literature review identified 262 relevant documents, after which a thematic content analysis was performed. Conceptual blockchain literature was identified to propose blockchain benefits for the real estate sector in four categories: land administration, real estate transactions, tokenization, and real estate management. The thematic content analysis also identified 26 empirical applications, of which all except one were related to land administration. Although the conceptual and theoretical blockchain literature presents blockchain as a disruptive and transformative technology for the real estate sector, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain adoption materializes more in hybrid, smaller-scale settings, where blockchain is merely an add-on layer to existing systems. Overall, most of the conceptual blockchain benefits remain empirically unconfirmed. On the other hand, the empirical applications suggest that blockchain could, for example, increase efficiency, reduce time, and provide verifiability, transparency, and automation, even in smaller-scale, hybrid settings. In addition, the applications indicate that blockchain could, in some cases, help reduce fraud and increase security and trust compared with centralized digital solutions. Finally, the empirical insights emphasize the role of political will, regulatory framework, availability of reliable digital data, publicâprivate partnerships, and educational aspects in blockchain applications.",

In contrast, Hyperconnected Diasporas (HD) are data-driven networks engaged in extractive activities, often employed for government (para)diplomacy, heavily relying on social media extractivist data-opolies or Big Tech platforms. This article examines the impact of disruptive technologies on e-diasporas in the context of data extractivism, particularly stemming from HD. The article pursues a dual objective: (i) reviewing existing literature and comparing five disruptive technologiesâBlockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Data Cooperatives, Metaverse, and ChatGPTâin sustaining e-diasporas as networks driven by human agency, and (ii) scrutinizing associated opportunities and risks, including challenges to institutional trust and data privacy arising from HD. The study seeks to elucidate how these technologies may either hinder or exacerbate the impacts of HD on e-diasporas, characterized by their human-driven nature. The article begins with an introduction to HD, followed by a literature review on e-diasporas. Methodologically, it presents a comparative analysis of the five disruptive technologies concerning the research question and discusses their implications for e-diasporic communities, concluding with final remarks.",

Later, a supervisable consensus scheme based on improved DPOS-PBFT (Delegated proof of stake-Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) was proposed. In the context of the development of the Internet of Things technology, the decentralized distributed computing paradigm is used to improve the blockchain smart contract technology, and the DPOS blockchain consensus mechanism is optimized based on the DPOS protocol of the credit model. In addition, through the dynamic grouping algorithm of credibility, the research ranks the credit level of the consensus nodes of the blockchain network, thus further realizing the supervision of the Internet of Things system. The results of the case analysis show that the success rate of the mechanism algorithm can still be maintained at about 97% after 3000 user requests, the maximum delay remains below 8s after 3000 user requests, the minimum delay is always around 3s, the average delay is 2.38s, the overall performance of the algorithm is superior. It can ensure the final consistency of data transmission of each node in the Internet of Things, the research on the blockchain consensus mechanism in the Internet of Things has practical reference value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, several recently published metaheuristic algorithms are adapted to optimize the NP-hard problem of jointly mining decision and resource allocation in mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled blockchain networks under two different encoding schemes. The first scheme represents individuals in a way that incorporates the mining decisions, transmission power, and computing resources of all miners for each individual, with mining decisions determined by a binary vector whose values indicate whether miners partake in mining or not. While, the second scheme makes each individual accountable for the transmission power and computing resources of each participant miner, treating all individuals as a singular solution to the problem. Then the Nutcracker optimization algorithm and gradient-based optimizer are modified to propose two robust variants, MNOA and MGBO, respectively. We then combine MNOA and MGBO to create HNOA, which further optimizes the mining decision and resource allocation in this problem. HNOA and other variants are validated using nine instances with a range of 150 to 600 miners. HNOA is also compared to several competing optimizers to demonstrate its efficacy in terms of several performance metrics. The experimental findings show the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",

Hence, the classic centralized trust management method cannot be directly applied to it. Blockchain technology is essential to achieving decentralized trust management, its consensus mechanism is useful in addressing large-scale data sharing and data consensus challenges. Herein, an n-party quantum detectable Byzantine agreement (DBA) based on the GHZ state to realize the data consensus in a quantum blockchain is proposed, considering the threat posed by the growth of quantum information technology on the traditional blockchain. Relying on the nonlocality of the GHZ state, the proposed protocol detects the honesty of nodes by allocating the entanglement resources between different nodes. The GHZ state is notably simpler to prepare than other multi-particle entangled states, thus reducing preparation consumption and increasing practicality. When the number of network nodes increases, the proposed protocol provides better scalability and stronger practicability than the current quantum DBA. In addition, the proposed protocol has the optimal fault-tolerant found and does not rely on any other presumptions. A consensus can be reached even when there are\ntraitors. The performance analysis confirms viability and effectiveness through exemplification. The security analysis also demonstrates that the quantum DBA protocol is unconditionally secure, effectively ensuring the security of data and realizing data consistency in the quantum blockchain.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) is set to revolutionize the pace of interaction among entities, ushering in a proliferation of applications characterized by heightened quality and diversity. Among the pivotal applications within the realm of IoT, as a significant example, the Smart Grid (SG) evolves into intricate networks of energy deployment marked by data integration. This evolution concurrently entails data interchange with other IoT entities. However, there are also several challenges including data-sharing overheads and the intricate establishment of trusted centers in the IoT ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical secure data-sharing platform empowered by cloud-fog integration. Furthermore, we propose a novel non-interactive zero-knowledge proof-based group authentication and key agreement protocol that supports one-to-many sharing sets of IoT data, especially SG data. The security formal verification tool shows that the proposed scheme can achieve mutual authentication and secure data sharing while protecting the privacy of data providers. Compared with previous IoT data sharing schemes, the proposed scheme has advantages in both computational and transmission efficiency, and has more superiority with the increasing volume of shared data or increasing number of participants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid development of the Internet and Internet of Things has rapidly introduced human society into the information age, and the way of fake news production has been updated, which has greatly affected the normal life of human beings. In order to identify worthless fake news and trace massive fake news data from unknown sources, and share valuable news data to fully disseminate effective real news, news owners usually store news data in cloud. Users of IoT terminals can access news data on demand without storing it locally. However, the authenticity of the fictive newspaper numbers source, which is easy to destroy, and the social media platform. Besides, when massive news data is saved on cloud server, the news owners have to at the risk of lose physical control over news data and it will face the risk of fake news being disseminated and real news being falsified. Thus, this paper proposes a novel mechanism for secure storage of news data using blockchain technology. Firstly, traceability and verification of fake news data is improved by the cooperative storage model on and off the chain. Secondly due to the inability of past polynomial commitment to update the commitment, we will be a hindrance to use polynomial commitment to build a secure authentication protocol. Therefore, in this paper, we design the update algorithm for polynomial commitment in order to be able to guarantee the consistency of on-chain and blockchain database news data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nTo abate global carbon emissions, there has been an unprecedented push for carbon transparency in the manufacturing industry. However, with products becoming increasingly complex, they contain sub-assemblies with components that have sub-components supplied by different manufacturers. This creates a multi-tier supply chain that complicates the propagation of sustainability information necessary to compute the product's carbon emission due to the lack of oversight and potential loss of information from manufacturers in the multi-tier supply chain. Blockchain technology, characterized by its immutability, visibility, and traceability, is a promising medium to propagate sustainability information. Despite the fact that many papers have proposed a system that is viable for products with a multi-tier supply chain in the literature, we have not seen its proof-of-concept yet. This work first proposes a blockchain-enabled system that enables the propagation of environmental sustainability information in a multi-tier supply chain. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed blockchain system and the data structure of each block in the blockchain. Based on the defined architecture, we implemented the proposed blockchain system with Ethereum and tested it using the pseudo-multi-tier supply chain of a torchlight.",

For that, a proposed methodology is presented which provide a complete scenario of how to integrate IPFS and blockchain in RSS.\nâ¢\nIn the proposed system, we build and deploy a smart contract, and we investigate the expenses incurred by employing such design for both drivers and riders.\nâ¢\nThis smart contract is evaluated by deploying it to a local network Ganache.\nâ¢\nLastly, extensive evaluation of the proposed system has been performed. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability, verifiability, and superior performance of the proposed ride-sharing system.\nAbstract\nRide-sharing services (RSSs) using centralization methods experience various challenges like single point-of-failure, privacy violation, lack of security, and distributed denial of services (DDoS) attack, etc. So, blockchain-based RSSs mitigate such problems through decentralization. Relying on the blockchain only leads to problems such as increase in application response time, chain size, and a high computational cost due to the increase in data storage in blockchain and thus increase the service costs to end users. Additionally, the blockchain lacks to scalability of data because of the inability to store large-sized data and accommodate the grows of ride-sharing data. To overcome these problems, a novel decentralized ride-sharing system that exploits blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is proposed. The goal of the proposed system is to move all ride-sharing data outside the blockchain and replacing it with a small hash. The blockchain manages the application state and users. In addition, it automates processes through smart contracts. While the IPFS stores data for blockchain in immutable and integral way. Wherefore, the proposed ride-sharing system integrates IPFS with blockchain for RSSs to retain the provided assurance by the blockchain and provide efficient service to end users. Experimental results proved the applicability and efficiency of RSS based on blockchain and IPFS which provides efficient storage of ride-sharing data, immutable history, and generally better efficiency in a decentralized manner.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nFinTech has proven its true potential in traditional financial offerings by delivering digital financial services to individuals worldwide. The pandemic has accelerated how people interact with financial services and has resulted in long-term changes to societies and economies. FinTech has expanded access to financial services and has made such changes possible. FinTech or Financial Technology refers to using new technologies for financial services. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and cloud computing are a few technologies currently being applied to FinTech. In this paper, we consider FinTech, which partly uses blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in the financial sector as it ultimately lifts trust and the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. This survey provides a comprehensive summary of the most relevant blockchain-based FinTech implementations and an overview of FinTech sectors and segments. For each segment, we provide a critique and a discussion on how each blockchain implementation contributes to solving the majority of problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. This research aims to direct the future of financial solutions by providing an outline of the applications of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for FinTech. We discuss various implementations, limitations, and challenges of blockchain-based FinTech applications. We conclude this work by exploring possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs one of the most popular drinks in the world, coffee has limitations in its complex and opaque supply chain. Consumers have difficulty verifying coffee quality according to the price they pay. However, innovative technologies such as blockchain emerge with the potential to support the coffee supply chain to be more transparent and traceable. Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record-keeping, which makes it an ideal tool for tracking the movement of coffee beans throughout the supply chain, from farmers to roasters to retailers. Each step in the coffee supply chain could be logged and tracked using blockchain, thus supporting greater transparency. Traceability would make it easier to identify and track any issues or irregularities in the supply chain. We propose a model to transform a coffee industry supply chain business process into a blockchainable workflow. In addition, an application was developed to allow each stakeholder in the supply chain to contribute to the data collection and monitor the status of each coffee batch. The application prototype was implemented and evaluated in one of the coffee industries in Indonesia. This research will benefit farmers in getting fair prices and end-consumers getting quality assurance.",

An Ethereum Blockchain owner's real identity is concealed behind a pseudonym termed an address. Because of this, Ethereum is frequently used in illegal activities like gambling and ransomware attacks because it is popularly believed to offer the highest level of anonymity. As a result, it is necessary to categorize the various malicious cybercriminal users' activities and addresses in the Ethereum Blockchain. The Blockchain's public data enables an in-depth analysis. Using supervised machine learning models including linear, non-linear, and ensemble learning models based on malicious and non-malicious activities, the classification of Ethereum Blockchain addresses is carried out in this paper. In this research work, cross-validation accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score have been employed for the assessment. Findings indicate that linear and non-linear machine learning approaches are superior to ensemble learning for classifying Ethereum Blockchain addresses. The results also show that it is possible to discover the Ethereum Blockchain addresses of malicious users.",

One current application is in remanufacturing. In this paper we consider the combination of remanufacturing and blockchain, and model a supply chain composed of a manufacturer, a third-party firm, and an online platform. Among them, the manufacturer faces the cap-and-trade regulation and adopts blockchain to record the information on the used products and then remanufactures products. The platform has the power to expand the potential market size and can operate in the marketplace or reselling mode. The third-party firm collects used products for the manufacturer. We conduct a Stackelberg game analysis and obtain the following major findings: First, the optimal production quantities and optimal collection rates with and without blockchain in the marketplace and reselling modes increase with the allocated cap and platform-enabled power. Second, in the reselling or marketplace mode, the manufacturer should not adopt blockchain if the emissions intensity is low; otherwise, it should adopt blockchain. Third, selecting the reselling (marketplace) mode is more profitable for the manufacturer if the platform-enabled power is low (high). Fourth, for quantity coordination, the reselling mode under the wholesale price contract can always coordinate the manufacturer and platform, and the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm. However, the marketplace mode with a commission rate can only coordinate the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm. For social welfare coordination, the manufacturer, online platform, and third-party firm can achieve coordination in the marketplace or reselling mode. Finally, extending the work to consider the cross-channel effect, we find that the major findings for both quantity coordination and social welfare coordination in the reselling and marketplace modes still hold.",

An example of a well-known technology using Blockchain is Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology will ensure that data residing within each block cannot be tampered with by anyone other than the owner. This paper uses Blockchain technology to develop a system where customers can validate a product legitimacy without the need of a corresponding merchant. This system will be able to be used by manufacturers and companies to ensure that their products will be harder to counterfeit, therefore they will gain more trust from customers. The Ethereum blockchain is used to build the proposed model that is capable of tracing every item's creation and transactions, ensuring the credibility of an item's genuineness. Our simulation results in an effective model and a cost analysis that shows that the model uses an average gas amount of 715,046.3 gwei.",

When using a cloud-hosted web application, users only ever interact with web interfaces of the web applications and are usually completely unaware of how their data is distributed amongst the multiple cloud service providers that the web application uses, making it difficult to verify the lawful use and ownership of personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seeks to empower users to gain better control over their personal data. Blockchain-based approaches have risen in popularity over the recent years to tackle the challenge of verifying GDPR compliance in multi-cloud environments. By deploying smart contracts on the blockchain, we can create transparent and immutable logs of data processes in the hopes of automating GDPR compliance verification. However, the existing works are still limited to provide a user-centric compliance verification. To this end, we propose a user-centric, blockchain-based framework for data management in a cloud environment where all GDPR-relevant data operations take place on the blockchain through well-defined smart contracts.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (182KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Classical self-standing manufacturing systems are evolving into collaborative networks such as Cloud Manufacturing (based on centralized knowledge and distributed resources) or Shared Manufacturing (based on fully decentralized knowledge and distributed resources) as a solution to ensure business continuity under normal as well as special circumstances. Additive Manufacturing (AM), one of the enablers of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is a promising technology for innovative production models due to its inherent distributed capabilities, digital nature, and product customization ability. To increase the adaptivity of distributed resources using AM technology, this paper proposes a mechanism for sharing workload and resources under unexpected behaviours in the supply chain. Smart contracts and blockchain technology in this concept are used to provide decentralized, transparent, and trusted operation of such systems, which provide more resilience to disruptive factors. In this paper, the proposed Blockchain-based Shared Additive Manufacturing (BBSAM) protocol, ontology, and workflow for AM capacity pooling are discussed and analysed under special conditions such as anomalous demand. Discrete-time Python simulation on a real Italian AM market dataset, also provided, is available on GitHub.",

This article illustrates the principle of Income Sharing as a highly performing economic strategy for supply chains with a natural implementation in blockchain smart contracts. It proposes a blockchain-based architecture that uses smart contracts to implement various algorithmic versions of the Income Sharing principle among companies participating in a supply chain. The formation of the total income and its consequent redistribution are calculated taking into account the role of the technological platform automating these procedures, which therefore becomes a party to the inter-company business project of a supply chain in the alternative roles, as feasible in business practice, of Blockchain-as-a-Service and Blockchain-as-a-Partner. The approach is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric, the most widespread platform for private and consortium blockchains. We compare and justify this design choice with the alternative given by public blockchains, with specific attention to Ethereum.",

Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner.\nMethods\nWe have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI.\nResults\nA case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s.\nConclusions\nThis study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE.",

A big part of the topic was tied around blockchain technology that due to its decentralization feature can simplify the complexity of the supply chain network and interconnect its actors. Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated the feasibility in detail, yet not covered limitations other than those generally discussed. The purpose of the study is to identify and summarize the challenges of blockchain implementation in the maritime industry and within maritime ports. Based on the literature and previous research findings, 18 challenges to the blockchain implementation were identified and categorized into four dimensions: human factor, operational, organizational, and technological. The findings show that different priorities among ports, low level of digitalization, scalability of blockchain systems, and unwillingness to change business routine are important challenges.",

Efforts to forecast consumer demand represent a source of conflict. The coordination of forecasts requires a powerful incentive alignment approach. This work proposes a smart contract equipped consortium blockchain system that creates an incentive structure that makes coordination with respect to forecasts economically appealing. Distortions of demand information due to uncoordinated forecasting are captured by a bullwhip measure that factors both forecast error and variance. Cooperation under the system is shown to help minimize this bullwhip measure, thus generating new outcomes for the participants that allow for a higher reward. Under a fixed payout structure, the system achieves credibility of continued cooperation, thus promoting an optimally coordinated equilibrium between the retailer and supplier. Blockchain technology represents a novel information system and consensus formation mechanism that can intermediate the behavior of a supply chain network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs smart grids advance rapidly, they are evolving along two primary trajectories: (1) digitalization through the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and intelligent control, and (2) decentralization by leveraging small-scale distributed energy sources for control. However, these developments also introduce complexities in the functioning, management, and control of smart grids. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a transparent, secure, robust, transactive, and scalable framework for all stakeholders and operators. Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution for this new smart grid paradigm, providing a range of features, including a distributed ledger, immutability, consensus, security, and automation. This article highlights the challenges in smart grid management, control, and operations, and discusses the potential of blockchain-based solutions to address these issues. It demonstrates that the adoption of blockchain can significantly enhance the overall functioning of the infrastructure by establishing a decentralized architecture without central governance.",

Purchasing essential stationery products, filing bills for acquired items, approving attendance at conferences, processing insurance claims, approving loans, and similar tasks are examples for which employees require approvals from multiple authorities within an organization. Common concerns mentioned by both the approving authority and the proposal submitter are the genuineness of the proposer and the time required for approving the proposal. This paper presents a novel Blockchain-based Approval Process System (BAPS) to establish mutual trust between the submitter and the approving authorities. The proposed systemâs design, implementation, and evaluation are included in this paper. The suggested approach can shorten the time needed to obtain the permissions and increase transparency between the users and the authority. In addition, it eliminates issues such as the misplacement of papers. It stores the information in a secure and tamper-proof platform which is some of the most significant drawbacks of traditional paper-based systems.",

This paper presents a classification of over one hundred blockchain platforms. We develop smart contracts for detecting healthcare insurance frauds using the top two blockchain platforms selected based on our proposed decision-making map approach which selects the top suitable platforms for healthcare insurance frauds detection application. Our classification shows that the largest percentage of platforms can be used for all types of application domains, the second biggest percentage for financial services, and a small number is to develop applications in specific domains. Our decision-making map and performance evaluations reveal that Hyperledger Fabric surpassed Neo in all metrics for detecting healthcare insurance frauds.",

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified â one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.",

This creates islands of disconnected communities which prohibits visibility across the entire supply chain. This paper introduces a framework, which aims at unifying multiple proprietary Blockchain systems, offering an opportunity to empower stakeholders across the entire supply chain to collaborate and exchange information seamlessly. The Blockchain Interoperability framework employs smart contracts, which aspire to automate previously cumbersome processes and bring value to the Physical Internet (PI) paradigm. Smart contracts guarantee a trustworthy and distributed process of contract negotiation and execution that significantly reduces time, administrative overheads, and costs which are currently typically spent on manual inter-organisational processes.",

High security for the bioacoustics signal authentication mechanism is guaranteed by using an optimised number of secured features from the bioacoustics signal rather than conventional biometric features for authentication, and by utilising a blockchain model to improve the robustness of multiple checks on the data. It allows for trustworthy authentication and the tracking of terminal activity. Then, light weighted cryptography (LWC) is developed to offer protection at each edge node and terminal. Finally, the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for retraining the features of the bioacoustics signal serves as the foundation for the catching method. It improves hit ratio while decreasing delay time. The experimental setup uses the bioacoustics signals for authentication instead of conventional biometric features, and the use of a blockchain model for data transparency improves the efficiency of multiple checks. When this happens, privacy and safety are both boosted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the development of blockchain technology has brought a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios from finance to healthcare, IoT, management and many more. This is because the blockchain, a distributed digital ledger, acts as an environment of trust and transparency. The subject of digital identity is getting more and more attention as it represents more than just replacing physical documents (e.g. ID cards, driver's license) with digital data. It would enable the digitalization and automation of the process of identification as well as protect people against identity theft and fraud. This paper proposes and implements a model for digital identity that relies on blockchain technology and cryptography to ensure the privacy, validity and integrity of personal user data. These are obtained with the help of cryptographic signatures, which are the digital representation of physical signatures or stamps. A set of trusted authorities are in charge of issuing cryptographic signatures and storing them on the blockchain. Through issued cryptographic signatures, the authorities account for the digital identity of the users, similar to how public institutions issue identity documents for their citizens which prove their identity. Using digital identity in multi-participant decision support systems improves the decision-making process through trust, anonymity and interoperability.",

However, hospital servers cannot be trusted and have limited computing resources. Data integrity verification for the cloud-edge healthcare system is an urgent concern. To this end, we proposed a data integrity auditing scheme based on blockchain. First, a distributed data integrity verification method without a third-party auditor is designed. The data are divided into smaller parts and hashed into a hash table. The verification tag is constructed according to the column of the hash table and secret string generated by a pseudo-random function. Then, a detailed blockchain-based data integrity auditing scheme is proposed, including Proof of Auditing Frequency and block structure. Besides, a security analysis for the common attacks is given. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated against two start-of-the-art schemes in a simulated cloud-edge healthcare system. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can verify data integrity without losing efficiency.",

Mixing services are commonly applied to enhance anonymity and make transaction records more challenging to follow and analyze. The current research on peeling chains is generally based on heuristic algorithms to identify change addresses. However, due to the characteristics and limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain, there is no such ground truth to ensure the accuracy of each derived change address. This research analyzes the peeling chain patterns based on self-change addresses. The use of self-change addresses implies that the input address and the address used for receiving the change are controlled by the same entity. Also, each chain's transaction details and generated chain parameters are further verified for more precise results. Combining the two methods ensures the accuracy of the extracted peeling chains to some extent. And the corresponding behavior pattern of the extracted chains is studied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe sharding technique enables blockchain to process transactions in parallel by dividing blockchain nodes into small groups, each of which handles a subset of all transactions. One of the issues with blockchain sharding is generating a large number of cross-shard transactions that need to be checked on the output shard as well as the destination shard. Our analysis suggests that the processing efficiency of cross-shard transactions is consistent with the barrel effect, i.e., that efficiency is more dependent on slower processing shard. Most of the existing studies focus on how to deal with cross-shard transactions, but neglecting the fact that the relative independence between sharding results in different incentive costs between sharding. We perform a sharding analysis on 100,000 real transactions data on Ethereum, and the results show that there is a large difference in gas prices between different shards indeed. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Weight Incentive (AWI) for Blockchain Sharding, which uses adaptive weight in place of traditional incentive, to address the problem of differing incentive costs for each shard. Take Ethereum as an example, AWI-BS computes the weight of a transaction as a function of a combination of the underlying gas price, the latency of the transaction, and the urgency of the transaction. Then the node chooses which transaction to pack based on the AWI-BS. Lastly, we also perform an in-depth analysis of AWI-BS's security and effectiveness. The evaluation indicates that AWI-BS outperforms the other alternatives in terms of transaction confirmation latency, transaction hit rate, and system throughput.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSupply chain management is a critical aspect of the pharmaceutical industry, as it ensures the timely and efficient delivery of essential drugs to end users. Dual-use drugs are those drugs which have both medical and non-medical applications. However, the management of dual-use drugs presents additional challenges, due to the possibility of misuse, diversion, and tampering. To address these challenges, it is necessary to track the supply chain of these dual-use drugs from the manufacturer to the end user. This research study investigates the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain management of dual-use drugs. This study explores the potential benefits of blockchain in improving the transparency, traceability, and security of the supply chain while reducing the risk of fraud and misuse. Additionally, the consensus algorithm inherent in blockchain technology makes it an ideal solution for preventing the manipulation and illegal export of dual-use drugs.",

Beyond the new currencies that were created around different incarnations of the blockchain concept, there are many other contributions that provide interesting services as a data linked structure using a decentralized network that provide a high level of security. Companies have developed many projects to incorporate blockchain into their business logic pursuing to incorporate other related services as persistence of large volumes of data, privacy or anonymity of transactions, distributed data processing, security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability), document management or micro messages in real time. Nevertheless, as it will be discussed in this article, current blockchains do not meet the needs of companies in many aspects, leading to a scarce or superficial adoption. This article introduces Kriper, a blockchain that aims at meeting corporate world needs by responding with a community-based, open blockchain that may also be segregated and private for certain uses whereas it provides a permissioned distributed storage and micro message lightweight services.",

A key technology underpinning P2P electricity trading is the blockchain, which ensures that P2P trading is efficient and transparent. However, due to the limited calculation performance of blockchain, the blockchain-based P2P trading process has to be simplified, which makes on-chain grid security-constrained trading adjustment and on-chain power loss allocation become difficult to be solved. To address this challenge, a new on-chain P2P electricity trading framework with easy implementation is proposed. First, an on-chain linear power flow (OC-LPF) model is developed to reduce the difficulty of on-chain power flow calculation. Second, a novel self-adjustment loss allocation model with low complexity is proposed, which integrates the power loss into OC-LPF-based virtual power variable, and enables power flow calculation and power loss allocation to be performed synchronously. Third, a distributed market clearing algorithm with accelerated convergence based on the OC-LPF model is designed to improve the efficiency of on-chain convergence while protecting the privacy of participants. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism has been verified with simulation studies on Ethereum.",

In order to better carry out the low-carbon management of the regional energy economy, based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, the present study utilized this technology to achieve intelligent and digital management of carbon emissions, and established a carbon emission prediction system. The cuckoo algorithm is used to improve the long-term memory network, and the improved algorithm is used in carbon emission prediction and management. The experimental results show that the improved Long Short Term Memory networks are close to the target precision in 240 iterations, and the convergence speed is fast. In the short-term regional carbon emission prediction, the average absolute error of the method is only 2%, which is highly consistent with the actual carbon emission. In the long-term carbon emission prediction, the average prediction accuracy of the upgraded long-term short-term memory networks can reach 97.26%, and the running time is only 19.46s. With high precision and running efficiency, the upgraded Long Short Term Memory networks can efficiently monitor regional carbon emission and provide a technical reference for the low-carbon management of the regional power industry.",

The integration of the physical and digital domains is crucial for unlocking the full potential of the IIoT, and digital twins can facilitate this integration by providing a virtual representation of real-world entities.\nObjectives:\nBy combining digital twins with the IIoT, industries can simulate, predict, and control physical behaviors, enabling them to achieve broader value and support industry 4.0 and 5.0. Constituents of cooperative IIoT domains tend to interact and collaborate during their complicated operations.\nMethods:\nTo secure such interaction and collaborations, we introduce a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication protocol for IIoT. The blockchain maintains only each domainâs dynamic accumulator, which accumulates crucial materials derived from devices, decreasing the overhead. In addition, we use the on-chain accumulator to effectively validate the unlinkable identities of cross-domain IIoT devices.\nResults:\nThe implementation of the concept reveals the fact that our protocol is efficient and reliable. This efficiency and reliability of our protocol is also substantiated through comparison with state-of-the-art literature. In contrast to related protocols, our protocol exhibits a minimum 22.67% increase in computation cost efficiency and a 16.35% rise in communication cost efficiency.\nConclusion:\nThe developed protocol guarantees data transfer security across the domain and thwarts IoT devices from potential physical attacks. Additionally, in order to protect privacy, anonymity and unlinkability are also guaranteed.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (148KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

Blockchain is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that relies on a network of peers to achieve consensus. Furthermore, other DLTs with similar functions might offer more viable solutions to replace Blockchain. One of these alternatives is Hashgraph, which employs a unique mechanism to manage distributed ledgers, claiming to be faster, more secure, and impartial. As a result, a thorough comparative analysis was conducted between these two technologies to determine which would emerge as the dominant technology in the market. The fundamental features of DLTs include decentralization, security, transparency, and integrity, albeit not all DLTs possess the same structures or functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technology provides transparency and reliability by sharing transactions and maintaining the same information through consensus among all participants. However, single-signature applications in transactions can lead to user identification issues due to the reuse of public keys. To address this issue, group signatures can be used, where the same group public key is used to verify signatures from group members to provide anonymity to users. However, in dynamic groups where membership may change, an attack can occur where a user who has left the group can disguise themselves as a group member by leaking a partial key. This problem cannot be traced back to the partial key leaker. In this paper, we propose assigning different partial keys to group members to trace partial key leakers and partially alleviate the damage caused by partial key leaks. Exist schemes have shown that arbitrary tracing issues occurred when a single administrator had exclusive key generation and tracing authority. This paper proposes a group signature scheme that solves the synchronization problem by involving a threshold number of TMs while preventing arbitrary tracing by distributing authority among multiple TMs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nNew blockchain platforms are launching at a high cadence, each fighting for attention, adoption, and infrastructure resources. Several studies have measured the peer-to-peer (P2P) network decentralisation of Bitcoin and Ethereum (i.e., two of the largest used platforms). However, with the increasing demand for blockchain infrastructure, it is important to study node decentralisation across multiple blockchain networks, especially those containing a small number of nodes. In this paper, we propose NodeMaps, a data processing framework to capture, analyse, and visualise data from several popular P2P blockchain platforms, such as Cosmos, Stellar, Bitcoin, and Lightning Network. We compare and contrast the geographic distribution, the hosting provider diversity, and the software client variance in each of these platforms. Through our comparative analysis of node data, we found that Bitcoin and its Lightning Network Layer 2 protocol are widely decentralised P2P blockchain platforms, with the largest geographical reach and a high proportion of nodes operating on The Onion Router (TOR) privacy-focused network. Cosmos and Stellar blockchains have reduced node participation, with nodes predominantly operating in large cloud providers or well-known data centres.",

In this regard, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to fulfill these critical demands. Hence, this study suggests an approach utilizing Hyperledger Fabric to enhance the security of smart home systems through blockchain technology. The proposed solution addresses the security limitations often encountered in existing permissioned blockchain approaches. The architecture consists of four layers: Cloud Storage Layer, Blockchain Platform Layer, Application layer and IoT Devices Layer. We have integrated a cloud storage layer to take benefit of its inherent advantages in terms of efficiency and availability. Smart home devices frequently require computing resources and substantial storage capacity, both of which can be effectively provided by the cloud.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlockchain technologies have seen a steady growth in interest from industries as the technology is gaining maturity. It is offering a novel way to establish trust amongst multiple stakeholders without relying or trusting centralised authorities. While its use as a decentralised store of value has been validated through the emergence of cryptocurrencies, its use case in industrial applications with multiple stakeholder ecosystems such as industrial supply chain management, is still at an early stage of design and experimentation where private blockchains are used as opposed to public blockchains. Many enterprise blockchain projects failed to gain traction after initial launches, due to inefficient design, lack of incentives to all stakeholders or simply because the use of blockchain was not really necessary in the first place. There has been a need for a framework that allows blockchain designers and researchers to evaluate scenarios when a blockchain solution is useful and design the key configurations for an enterprise blockchain solution. Literature on blockchain architectures are sparse and only applicable to specific use cases or functionalities. This paper proposes a comprehensive Enterprise Blockchain Design Framework (EBDF), that not only identifies the relevant use cases when a blockchain must be utilised, but also details all the characteristics and configurations for designing an enterprise blockchain ecosystem, applicable to multiple industries. To validate the EBDF, we apply the same to the Vortal e-Procurement ecosystem allowing for multiple platforms to interoperate with greater transparency and accountability over the proposed blockchain framework. In this use case, many vendors bid for procurement procedures, often for publicly managed funds where it is extremely vital that full transparency and accountability is ensured in the entire process. Ensuring that certain digital certification functions, such as timestamps are independent from e-Procurement platform owners has been a challenge. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for not only ensuring transparency and immutability of records, but also providing for interoperability across different platforms by acting as a trusted third-party. The applied framework is used to design a Hyperledger based blockchain solution with some of the key architectural elements that could fulfil these needs while presenting the advantages of such a solution.",

This paper introduces a framework, which aims at unifying multiple proprietary Blockchain systems, offering an opportunity to empower stakeholders across the entire supply chain to collaborate and exchange information seamlessly. The Blockchain Interoperability framework employs smart contracts, which aspire to automate previously cumbersome processes and bring value to the Physical Internet (PI) paradigm.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we explore Blockchain technology can be used to build a reliable decentralised authentication system. High security for the bioacoustics signal authentication mechanism is guaranteed by using an optimised number of secured features from the bioacoustics signal rather than conventional biometric features for authentication, and by utilising a blockchain model to improve the robustness of multiple checks on the data. It allows for trustworthy authentication and the tracking of terminal activity. Then, light weighted cryptography (LWC) is developed to offer protection at each edge node and terminal. Finally, the belief propagation (BP) algorithm for retraining the features of the bioacoustics signal serves as the foundation for the catching method. It improves hit ratio while decreasing delay time. The experimental setup uses the bioacoustics signals for authentication instead of conventional biometric features, and the use of a blockchain model for data transparency improves the efficiency of multiple checks. When this happens, privacy and safety are both boosted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe banking sector is identified as the main means for laundering illicit money, these banks generally have access to both banking mechanism and legal authority to make decisions. Money launderers and those financing terrorism are conveniently accessing financial institutions and its mechanism. These institutions provide all financial funds transfers both domestic and international range. Anti-money laundering (AML) laws and other data protection laws that keep getting stricter have forced many financial institutions to put in place long, expensive processes to stay in compliance. To bridge the gap, emerging technology can help in mitigating money laundering and other financial crimes. Blockchain is considered one of the world's best-known examples of Distributed Ledger Technology. In the financial sector, this type of technology has been hailed as the key to future success. Emerging technology can be used in many ways in Financial Services. It can change many processes, payments between peer-to-peer, trade agreements and tracking of supply chains. Emerging technology can be used in many ways in financial services and can change many processes, peer-to-peer payments, trade agreements, and the tracking of supply chains. These use cases depend on the participants or users being identified and verified. \"Know Your Customer\" is the term for this (KYC). Before making a transaction, one of the most basic ways to build trust between the people involved is to check out the user.\nThis current paper focuses on issues of compliance and Anti Money Laundering policies in the banking sector by using new emerging technologies such as blockchain; further, the paper focuses keenly on issues relating to the manipulation of KYC and the financial burden on banks while also addressing AML policies, Finally, the paper provides ideas and suggestions regarding the rise of emerging technologies such as blockchain while addressing the problems of ML. This also includes the capability of blockchain technology to bring banking systems with recalibrated mode of compliances polices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSupply chain management is a critical aspect of the pharmaceutical industry, as it ensures the timely and efficient delivery of essential drugs to end users. Dual-use drugs are those drugs which have both medical and non-medical applications. However, the management of dual-use drugs presents additional challenges, due to the possibility of misuse, diversion, and tampering. To address these challenges, it is necessary to track the supply chain of these dual-use drugs from the manufacturer to the end user. This research study investigates the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain management of dual-use drugs. This study explores the potential benefits of blockchain in improving the transparency, traceability, and security of the supply chain while reducing the risk of fraud and misuse. Additionally, the consensus algorithm inherent in blockchain technology makes it an ideal solution for preventing the manipulation and illegal export of dual-use drugs.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technology, the development of blockchain technology has also been deeply impacted. When performing block verification in the blockchain network, if all transactions are verified on the chain, this will cause the accumulation of data on the chain, resulting in data storage problems. At the same time, the security of data is also challenged, which will put enormous pressure on the block, resulting in extremely low communication efficiency of the block. The traditional blockchain system uses the Merkle Tree method to store data. While verifying the integrity and correctness of the data, the amount of proof is large, and it is impossible to verify the data in batches. A large amount of data proof will greatly impact the verification efficiency, which will cause end-to-end communication delays and seriously affect the blockchain systemâs stability, efficiency, and security. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes to replace the Merkle tree with polynomial commitments, which take advantage of the properties of polynomials to reduce the proof size and communication consumption. By realizing the ingenious use of aggregated proof and smart contracts, the verification efficiency of blocks is improved, and the pressure of node communication is reduced.",

One of these alternatives is Hashgraph, which employs a unique mechanism to manage distributed ledgers, claiming to be faster, more secure, and impartial. As a result, a thorough comparative analysis was conducted between these two technologies to determine which would emerge as the dominant technology in the market.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nElectronic auctions (e-auctions) remove the physical limitations of traditional auctions and bring this mechanism to the general public. However, most e-auction schemes involve a trusted auctioneer, which is not always credible in practice. Some studies have applied cryptography tools to solve this problem by distributing trust, but they ignore the existence of collusion. In this paper, a blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Collusion-Resistant scheme (PPCR) for double auctions is proposed by employing both cryptography and blockchain technology, which is the first decentralized and collusion-resistant double auction scheme that guarantees bidder anonymity and bid privacy. A two-server-based auction framework is designed to support off-chain allocation with privacy preservation and on-chain dispute resolution for collusion resistance. A Dispute Resolution agreement (DR) is provided to the auctioneer to prove that they have conducted the auction correctly and the result is fair and correct. In addition, a Concise Dispute Resolution protocol (CDR) is designed to handle situations where the number of accused winners is small, significantly reducing the computation cost of dispute resolution. Extensive experimental results confirm that PPCR can indeed achieve efficient collusion resistance and verifiability of auction results with low on-chain and off-chain computational overhead.",
