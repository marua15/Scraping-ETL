Continuous software and system engineering processes, e.g., DevOps, are increasingly adopted and spread across organizations. In parallel, many leading companies have begun to apply artificial intelligence (AI) principles and techniques, including Machine Learning (ML), to improve their products. However, there is no holistic approach that can support and enhance the growing challenges of DevOps. In this paper, we propose a software architecture that provides the foundations of a model-based framework for the development of AI-augmented solutions incorporating methods and tools for continuous software and system engineering and validation. The key characteristic of the proposed architecture is that it allows leveraging the advantages of both AI/ML and Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches and techniques in a DevOps context. This architecture has been designed, developed and applied in the context of the European large collaborative project named AIDOaRt. In this paper, we also report on the practical evaluation of this architecture. This evaluation is based on a significant set of technical solutions implemented and applied in the context of different real industrial case studies coming from the AIDOaRt project. Moreover, we analyze the collected results and discuss them according to both architectural and technical challenges we intend to tackle with the proposed architecture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nContext\nMany IT organizations turn to agile software delivery approaches such as DevOps in order to reduce the number of IT projects that are running behind schedule and above budget. However, the DevOps paradigm calls for an increased set of capabilities that need to be built and aligned with their context in order to ensure superior team performance.\nObjective\nThis research aims to develop a context-capability coalignment profile for DevOps teams in public organizations. This profile and the corresponding design approach may serve as a model for other software production teams seeking to enhance their performance through improved coalignment. The resulting set of design principles places the traditional information systems theories of dynamic capabilities and contingency theory in a modern context.\nMethod\nWe adopt a longitudinal action design research approach centered around a DevOps team working in the IT department of a Dutch public organization. A mixed method design including scientific questionnaires, workshops, expert opinions and semi-structured interviews is employed to build and evaluate the profile.\nResults\nThe resulting profile is characterized by technological complexity, a highly regulated environment, departmental interdependencies and high system relevance. The evaluation phase supports the validity of the artifact and suggests moderately improved coalignment of context and team capabilities after the research period, as well as a positive influence of coalignment on team performance.\nConclusion\nIt is contended that software teams in public organizations can benefit from improved coalignment between context and DevOps capabilities by following the presented approach. We argue that it is important to create a profile which is internally consistent and views coalignment as a continuous process in order to maximize the positive effect on team performance.",

However, the successful adoption of DevOps requires companies to address important cultural and organizational changes. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that various DevOps taxonomies exist, both from academic and practitioner perspectives, which may lead to misleading or failed adoption of DevOps.\nObjective:\nThis paper presents empirical research on the structure of DevOps teams in software-producing organizations. The goal is to better understand the organizational structure and characteristics of teams adopting DevOps by harmonizing the existing knowledge.\nMethods:\nTo achieve this, we employed a grounded theory approach with collaborative coding, involving two research groups. Inter-Coder Agreement (ICA) was utilized to guide the discussion rounds. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on DevOps teams and taxonomies to gain a deeper understanding of the subject.\nResults:\nFrom the analysis, we built a substantive and analytic theory of DevOps taxonomies. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the ten secondary studies processed and analytic in that it analyzes âwhat isâ rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the products resulting from the analysis and generation of the theory is available.\nConclusions:\nWe built a theory on DevOps taxonomies and tested whether it harmonizes the existing taxonomies, i.e., whether our theory can instantiate the others. This is the first step to define which taxonomies are best suited to approach DevOps culture and practices according to the companiesâ objectives and capabilities.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.",

DevOps is a methodology, widely used for developing Cloud Computing systems, that streamlines software development by improving its integration, delivery, and deployment. Although cloud application designers within a DevOps team are assumed to have development and operational knowledge, this does not fall within the skills of experts that design analytics applications of plant data. The deployment environment is also relevant since, as such applications are often hosted in the Fog, the proliferation of application components may hinder their composition and validation. This work is aimed at embracing the Platform Engineering approach to provide a tailored toolkit that guides the design and development of OpenFog compliant applications for the experts in the Smart Manufacturing domain. The platform uses Model Driven Engineering techniques and a flow-based visual editor to allow application designers to graphically compose applications from components previously delivered by component developers, abstracting them from the underlying technologies. As a result, containerized applications, ready to be deployed and run by a container orchestrator, are obtained. The feasibility of the proposal is proved through an industrial case study.",

In addition, the trend of developing software in a distributed manner greatly increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced team members from software companies to work remotely. We present the results of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of how DevOps has been applied in distributed and global settings that adopts Global Software Development (GSD). The results were obtained from analysing 27 papers. The main conclusions obtained after carrying our SMS show that adopting DevOps in such settings by implementing certain practices brings several advantages to software companies, even though there are difficulties to be confronted when adopting DevOps in global and distributed contexts. Moreover, we (1) proposed definition of DevOps in distributed and global settings, (2) mapped the challenges detected with a list of well-known GSD risks and (3) mapped the benefits that can be obtained from applying certain practices identified and the challenges that should be overcame to obtain such benefits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nInformation systems (IS) literature has predominantly studied IS project control with a focus on software development projects. However, by virtue of digital transformation, an increasing number of organizations are implementing cross-functional teams, combining software development with software operations tasks. The goal is to react quickly to the ever-changing market requirements.\nThe DevOps concept aims to effectively orchestrate development and operations activities and smoothly manage tensions within teams, resulting from the heterogeneous composition of skills, responsibilities, and working styles.\nIn contrast to the predominant project management view of control of prior research, which focuses on software development, this study investigates a different perspective: focusing on exerting control in DevOps teams and simultaneously navigating tensions between software development and operations. Utilizing an inductive theory-building approach, we first identify the four tensions discussed in prior literatureânamely, goal conflict, method discomfort, decision rights, and time rhythmâand then empirically derive corresponding resolutions.\nIntegrating our findings, we present an empirically derived model that can serve as a DevOps control approach for navigating the tensions between development and operations teams. This model extends our theoretical knowledge about control in DevOps teams and serves to inform IT practitioners, helping them successfully implement and manage DevOps teams.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nDevOps represents the fusion of cultural philosophies, tools, and practices that rapidly enhance an organization's capacity to deploy services and applications. Cloud-based tools, a subset of DevOps services, facilitate collaboration between development and operations teams within an organization. However, persistent challenges such as inadequate security management, substantial leakage of sensitive data, and system/service unavailability pose significant threats to sustainability. We propose an end-to-end enhanced security framework to fortify DevOps resilience by implementing authentication and vulnerability management through the Slide-Block methodology. Our approach comprises four sequential processes: pattern-based authentication, tri-level access control, privacy-focused data storage, and vulnerability management and correction. Initially, we establish candidate legitimacy through pattern-based authentication using the Magnificent Chacha-Poly 1305 algorithm. Subsequently, we devise effective access policies using the Enhanced Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EDDPG) algorithm, employing tri-level access control based on trust value, attributes, and roles for optimal user and developer selection via the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA). Moreover, we encrypt data in transit and at rest using Mcha-Poly 1305, considering sensitivity, and store it in a blockchain to enhance data privacy. Our approach incorporates a sliding window blockchain for secure data transmission and storage. Finally, we identify and address attack and application-based issues using the Tweak Naive Bayes (Tweak-NB) algorithm and Intruder Vulnerability Scanner (IVS). Our Slide-Block framework demonstrates superior performance in detection rate, authentication time, packet loss, security strengthening, communication overhead, and latency compared to existing models.",

The model emerged out of the observation that information systems operations and developments should be closely integrated activities to ensure the success of any organization. Thus, DevOps methods are an additive tool for companies to improve overall performance in their software development processes and operations.\nObjective:\nThis paper aims to identify the various critical success factors (CSFs) of DevOps projects that have been discussed in prior research. In addition, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for depicting how these CSFs impact or drive DevOps success.\nMethod:\nThis study consists of a systematic literature review to collect the primary articles for the analysis.\nResults:\nAfter searches in four major publication databases and snowballing, we selected 38 primary studies for the analysis. Nearly 100 different CSFs were identified, which were then categorized into Technical, Organizational, and Social & Cultural dimensions. Based on the results of the literature analysis, a comprehensive framework is proposed that depicts how the CSFs impact or drive DevOps success.\nConclusion:\nThis paper presents a DevOps framework with various CSFs based on prior literature. The proposed framework will provide collective knowledge of DevOps success factors, which will allow researchers and practitioners to enhance their understanding of CSFs and learn how to handle DevOps issues in organizations. In particular, the paper highlights a number of future research directions related to CSFs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nLog-based anomaly detection is important for improving the reliability and availability of software systems, especially those evolving using DevOps, owing to the huge number of logs generated during continuous practices. However, DevOps practitioners typically inspect and interpret the generated data and logs manually on specific occasions as part of the troubleshooting process. This process of manual inspection is time consuming and challenging because these data and logs have grown to an unmanageable size owing to the increasing size and complexity of the systems.\nIn this research paper, we introduce the DevOps Anomaly Detection Framework (DADF). DADF is composed of two components that rely on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the data and logs generated during DevOps practices to automatically detect anomalies. The first component is Anomaly Detection Before Production (ADBP), which intends to detect anomalies in the prospective release before its operation in the production environment by adopting the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) technique on the data collected during implementation, building, testing, and deployment. The second component is Anomaly Detection After Staging (ADAS), which intends to detect anomalies after the operation of the released system by adopting the Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) technique on the data collected during monitoring from the system log, application log, and performance metrics (CPU and memory). We experimentally evaluated ADBP and ADAS in two different real-world industrial projects. The experimental results demonstrated that the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the ADBP component were 96%, 87.5%, 100%, and 93.3%, respectively, and the normalized Root Mean Squared Error (nRMSE) of the ADAS component was 2â19%. Hence, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of DADF in helping DevOps practitioners and researchers automatically detect anomalies throughout the lifecycle of DevOps by monitoring all DevOpsâ practices.",

The DevOps concept of continuous monitoring may bring a lot of benefits to development teams such as early detection of run-time errors and various performance anomalies.\nObjective:\nWe aim to explore deep learning (DL) solutions for detection of anomalous systems behavior based on collected monitoring data that consists of applicationsâ and systemsâ performance metrics. Moreover, we specifically address a shortage of approaches for evaluating DL models without any ground truth data.\nMethods:\nWe perform a case study in a real DevOps environment, following the principles of the design science paradigm. The research activities span from practice to theory and from problem to solution domain, including problem conceptualization, solution design, instantiation, and empirical validation.\nResults:\nWe proposed and implemented a cloud solution for DL model deployment and evaluation empowered by feedback from the development team. The labeled data generated through the feedback was used for evaluation of current and training of new DL models in several iterations. The overall results showed that reconstruction-based models such as autoencoders, are quite robust to any parameter modification and are among the preferred for anomaly detection in multivariate monitoring data.\nConclusion:\nLeveraging raw monitoring data and DL-inspired solutions, DevOps teams may get critical insights into the software and its operation. In our case, this proved to be an efficient way of discovering early signs of production failures.",

This novel approach, which is commonly known as âDevOpsâ, promises many benefits such as increased speed and frequency of deployment. However, companies using DevOps are often struggling with demonstrating control of their software delivery processes to IT auditing parties, due to the decentralized decision-making structures and high degree of automation in DevOps teams. The research at hand presents a framework which aims to provide guidance to organizations in mitigating and governing risks in IT teams and departments that make use of the DevOps paradigm. We have adopted a design science research approach, building on a literature review and semi-structured interviews with seventeen employees from nine Dutch companies that are in different stages of their DevOps transition. The results suggest that two main factors which influence how departments design their DevOps environment are risk appetite and the DevOps maturity. We furthermore find that companies in practice often use a mixture of traditional, manual IT controls and the automated controls suggested in literature. Based on these insights, a situational control framework is designed which suggests suitable risk mitigation practices.",

In the process of information system lifecycle management, there are some problems, such as unclear division of responsibilities, long system construction time, high risk of system upgrade, etc. In order to solve the existing problems, this paper introduces and analyzes the DevOps engineering thought and technology which takes the development and operation and maintenance of information system as a whole, and studies the application model of DevOps in the current power information system management process. In recent years, with the development of machine learning and deep learning, artificial neural network algorithms have made breakthroughs in different fields, and various network mechanisms and training algorithms have emerged. For example, in the field of load forecasting, there are methods based on probability forecasting and so on. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of the new algorithm in the power system to improve the accuracy of power load forecasting and improve the reliability of power network operation. By studying the application model based on DevOps in the whole life cycle process of the power information system, it provides a research basis for the development of the power information system operation structure, and promotes the management of the information system to continuously meet the requirements of lean management and meet the needs of the company's business development.",

To ensure sufficient security in DevOps, it is essential to perform sufficient threat analysis during development. However, threat analysis is generally a heavy task and difficult to apply to agile processes. In addition, existing technologies are not sufficient for security feedback from Dev to Ops and Ops to Dev, which are important elements of DevOps. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting attacks using anomaly detection from operation logs, and extracting vulnerabilities and candidate countermeasures using information such as CAPEC and CWE. Furthermore, we propose a method to determine the excess or deficiency of the countermeasure by comparing it with the Attack-Defense Trees created in the previous development. By applying our proposal to an actual development case, we confirm that the proposed method works effectively.",

As a new concept of software R&D management, DevOps has been paid attention to and used by more and more IT companies by promoting the cooperative work of development, operation and maintenance and QA. Based on the concept of DevOps, this paper studies the native architecture and key technologies of intelligent cloud. Through the key technologies of intelligent operation and maintenance technology, such as trend prediction, data anomaly detection and fault location diagnosis, it can effectively solve the problems existing in traditional operation and maintenance methods when facing the cloud native system. The research results show that, combined with the deep learning model in intelligent operation and maintenance technology, the trend prediction algorithm is used in real-time monitoring system to predict the distribution and scheduling of microservice resources according to historical data, which is generally 30.28% higher than that before use. Cloud native technology can provide more economical and convenient deployment and operation methods for communication operators' networks. With the promotion of operators' cloud network convergence, cloud native technology will become the core technology and key starting point of operators' network cloudization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nEnterprise networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and large in scale due to the critical need for interconnectivity. For the interconnection of sites, VPN technology is essential. Indeed, this technology allows a partially or completely meshed connection between the various sites in a secure way. IPsec is one of the most widely deployed VPN technologies due to its many advantages, including data confidentiality, integrity and authentication. However, implementing this technology requires considerable technical expertise given the diversity of gateway manufacturers that a company may have, advanced engineering given the set of technical parameters that a VPN tunnel may have for its proper functioning, and caution when setting up a large-scale network given that a simple error may prevent the creation of tunnels. Taking these limitations into account, the automation of IT infrastructures has become indispensable, known as DevOps, which promotes continuous communication, collaboration, integration, visibility and transparency between the teams responsible for application development (Dev) and those responsible for IT operations (Ops). With infrastructure automation, networks are becoming easier to manage, diagnose and configure. This paper proposes a new architecture that automates the deployment of VPN tunnels via a web-based graphical interface. This architecture is adapted with a variety of equipment manufacturers and delivers configurations generated via an SSH channel in an automatic way.",

However, the limitations of prior education systems development are gradually exposed, which ignore the changing requirements, the high concurrency bottlenecks and lean development of education information systems. Therefore, we develop and build a novel education information system at ECNU based on DevOps and related techniques. This paper reveals the practice of DevOps for new education information system from four aspects: CI (Continuous Integration), CD (Continuous Deployment), log management, and code quality. Meanwhile, brief technical explanations include Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes, ELK, SonarQube, etc. Through our continuous engineering practice, the new education information system has been developed and implemented at ECNU. The DevOps practice for information system establishes that it is so convenient for developing, testing and release of education information systems, and it also improves reliability, availability and scalability of information platform especially considering the guarantee of efficiency.",

The goal of this study is to examine and contrast the difficulties encountered in the implementation of MLOps in enterprises with those encountered in DevOps. An SLR (Systematic Literature Review) is the first step in the research process to find the issues raised in the literature. The results of this study are based on qualitative content analysis using grounded theory and semi-structured interviews with 12 ML practitioners from different sectors. Organisational, technical, operational, and business problems are the four distinct aspects of challenges for MLOps that our study highlights. These challenges are further defined by eleven different themes. Our research indicates that while some issues, such as data and model complexity, are unique to MLOps, others are shared by DevOps and MLOps as well. The report offers suggestions for further research and summarises the difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nA multivocal literature review on DevSecOps (2012â2022).\nâ¢\nThe review of DevSecOps covers Definition, Challenges, Practices, Tools and Metrics.\nâ¢\nPresents a Challenge-Practice-Tool-Metric model for DevSecOps.\nâ¢\nThe global dimension of DevSecOps is missing in existing white and grey literature.\nAbstract\nContext:\nSecurity as a key non-functional requirement of software development is often ignored and devalued in DevOps programs, with security seen as an inhibitor to high velocity required in DevOps implementation. Hence, the DevSecOps approach as a security-orientated expansion to DevOps, has aimed to integrate security into DevOps implementation by promoting collaboration among development, operation and security teams. DevSecOps is a topical concept and rapidly emerging area of practice in both academic and industrial settings.\nObjective:\nWe reviewed both the white and grey literature to identify recent researches and practical trends of DevSecOps, aiming to: (a) review, document and analyze the current state of DevSecOps in the existing literature; (b) investigate the application of DevSecOps in Global Software Engineering (GSE) contexts.\nMethod:\nA Multi-vocal Literature Review on DevSecOps and its global application was conducted, by executing a dual-track strategy including white (104 studies) and grey (43 studies) literature from 2012 to 2021. A Thematic Analysis was performed to identify, synthesize and analyze the themes within data for reporting the MLR results.\nResults:\nThrough the Multi-vocal Literature Review and Thematic Analysis, this paper identifies five major aspects of DevSecOps (Definitions, Challenges, Practices, Tools/Technologies, and Metrics/Measurement); collects related themes of each aspect; and generates a Challenge-Practice-Tool-Metric (CPTM) model by integrating the themes of the latter four aspects within a lifecycle model. Moreover, an unexplored area relating to the global application of DevSecOps has been identified.\nConclusion:\nBased on MLR results, a CPTM (Challenge-Practice-Tool-Metric) model is built to reveal the current status of DevSecOps. The model provides a breakdown and a broad landscape of DevSecOps, from which researchers and practitioners may select an area of focus to improve their knowledge or practice. With DevSecOps spanning the many stages of the lifecycle, we believe the model will enable emphases and absences such as global aspects to be investigated.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.",

Whereas engineering is concerned with how to build systems, PM is concerned with âwhatâ to build and âwhyâ we should build the product. The role of PM is recognized as critical for the success of any product. However, few studies explore how the role of PM is changing due to recent trends that come with digitalization and digital transformation.\nObjectives:\nAlthough there is prominent research on PM, few studies explore how this role is changing due to the digital transformation of the software-intensive industry. In this paper, we study how trends such as DevOps and short feedback loops, data and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the emergence of digital ecosystems, are changing current product management practices.\nMethods:\nThis study employs a qualitative approach using multi-case study research as the method. For our research, we selected five case companies in the software-intensive systems domain. Through workshop sessions, frequent meetings and interviews, we explore how DevOps and short feedback loops, data and artificial intelligence (AI), and digital ecosystems challenge current PM practices.\nResults:\nOur study yielded an in-depth understanding of how digital transformation of the software-intensive systems industry is changing current PM practices. We present empirical results from workshops and from interviews in which case company representatives share their insights on how software, data and AI impact current PM practices. Based on these results, we present a framework organized along two dimensions, i.e. a certainty dimension and an approach dimension. The framework helps structure the approaches product managers can employ to select and prioritize development of new functionality.\nContributions:\nThe contribution of this paper is a framework for âStrategic Digital Product Managementâ (SDPM). The framework outlines nine approaches that product managers can employ to maximize the return on investment (RoI) of R&D using new digital technologies.",

This automation is enabled by the explicit definition of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), i.e., a set of scripts, often written in different modeling languages, which defines the infrastructure to be provisioned and applications to be deployed.\nWe introduce the DevOps Modeling Language (DOML), a new Cloud modeling language for infrastructure deployments. DOML is a modeling approach that can be mapped into multiple IaC languages, addressing infrastructure provisioning, application deployment and configuration.\nThe idea behind DOML is to use a single modeling paradigm which can help to reduce the need of deep technical expertise in using different specialized IaC languages.\nWe present the DOMLâs principles and discuss the related work on IaC languages. Furthermore, the advantages of the DOML for the end-user are demonstrated in comparison with some state-of-the-art IaC languages such as Ansible, Terraform, and Cloudify, and an evaluation of its effectiveness through several examples and a case study is provided.",

It investigates the potential of a Large Language Models, specifically ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Mistral, in assessing candidatesâ competencies in Information Technology (IT) compared to evaluations made by human experts. The experiment involved three experienced DevOps specialists who assessed the written responses of 21 candidates to ten industry-relevant questions; each limited to 500 characters. The evaluation was conducted using a simple yet effective â2 to 2 scale, with â2 indicating a negative assessment for incorrect answers, 0 for ambiguous or incomplete answers, and 2 for excellent responses. The same set of responses was then evaluated by LLMs, adhering to the identical criteria and scale. This comparative analysis aims to determine the reliability and accuracy of AI in replicating expert human judgement in IT recruitment. The studyâs findings, backed by the Fleiss kappa test, show that human reviewers are not perfectly aligned in their judgement. On the other hand, the AI tool also lacks consistency, as the consequent repetition of the same review request may result in a different decision. The results are anticipated to contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI-assisted decision-making and its practical applications in human resource management and recruitment.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (188KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nContext:\nIn mature software development organizations the ci/cd pipeline is the only route to deploy software into production. While the workflow of this process seems straightforward, the reality is different since exceptions and deviations are the norm in actual industry practice. In this context, Process Mining appears as a promising technique to uncover deviations and check compliance with standardized DevOps processes, and highlight bottlenecks and potential improvement areas.\nObjective:\nThis paper presents a case study designed to assess the potential of using Process Mining techniques to provide visibility into the deployment pipeline.\nMethod:\nThis research uses raw event data extracted from the continuous practices toolchain, which is then used to compute a comprehensive set of DevOps-specific metrics, thus supporting objective monitoring of the quality and efficiency of the deployment workflow. The study focuses on different development units in the Engineering team, each working in a distinct business context but sharing standard practices.\nResults:\nWe verified that even though there are standards for the deployment pipelines, each teamâs workflow denotes local variations with unique points for improvement that are highly coupled to their business unit context. We observed that each teamâs pipeline has different temporal profiles that reflect their context and work practices. Additionally, we identified a set of deployment pipeline metrics focusing on process compliance, efficiency, and deployment stability.\nConclusion:\nThe main contributions of this paper include (1) the description of an actual application of Process Mining to the deployment pipeline of a highly complex e-commerce platform, (2) how this approach provided an objective understanding of the efficiency and quality of the development workflow, (3) how this process-centric view, combined with domain-specific DevOps metrics, supports continuous practices, and (4) how Developers can analyse their workflows by applying Process Mining while using standard tools like GitLab and PM4Py.",

Additionally, there are attempts towards understanding practitionersâ roles and technical knowledge. MSAs call for affinity in several technologies as well as business domains. This diversity makes it challenging to scope and describe the roles of practitioners. In addition, practitioners often do not receive training and contents of MSA training remain largely undefined, even though there are challenges in finding or developing relevant technical expertise. In this research, we determine the different technical roles that are required in MSAs, along with their detailed competences. We use public online forums (e.g., StackOverflow), where developers share technical knowledge. We analyze 13,517 public profiles of software engineers, deriving their technical competences. Our taxonomy of technical competences in MSAs, contains 11 competences clusters, organized in 3 collections of competences â Web Technologies, DevOps, and Data Technologies. In addition, we derive the roles of microservice practitioners and the characteristics of their roles. Our findings organize the technical competences of MSAs practitioners and determine the training topics and combination of topics that can prepare engineers for MSAs.",

Development, Security, and Operations (DevSecOps) is developing the DevOps concept, which integrates security methods into a DevOps process. DevSecOps is a software development process where security is built in to ensure application confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nObjective\nThis paper aims to identify and prioritize the challenges associated with implementing the DevSecOps process.\nMethod\nWe performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) and conducted a questionnaire-based survey to identify challenges associated with DevSecOps-based projects. Moreover, interpretive structure modeling (ISM) was applied to study the relationships among the core categories of the challenges. Finally, we used the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize the identified challenges associated with DevSecOps projects.\nResults\nWe identified 18 challenges for the DevSecOps process and mapped them to 10 core categories. The ISM results indicate that the âstandardsâ category has the most decisive influence on the other nine core categories of the identified challenges. Moreover, the fuzzy TOPSIS indicates that âlack of secure coding standards,â âlack of automated testing tools for security in DevOps,â and âignorance in static testing for security due to lack of knowledgeâ are the highest priority challenges for the DevSecOps paradigm.\nConclusion\nOrganizations using DevOps should consider the identified challenges in developing secure software.",

In this context, performance assessment is not easy, but recent studies have shown that architectural models evolving with the software can support this goal. In this paper, we present a mapping study aimed at classifying existing scientific contributions that deal with the architectural support for performance-targeted continuous software engineering. We have applied the systematic mapping methodology to an initial set of 215 potentially relevant papers and selected 66 primary studies that we have analyzed to characterize and classify the current state of research. This classification helps to focus on the main aspects that are being considered in this domain and, mostly, on the emerging findings and implications for future research.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.

However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges, especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holistic Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and the state-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation application development in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum system to streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combining hybrid quantumâclassical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adapting DevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiple well-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloud providers (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket). This paper proposes the concept of quantum function-as-a-service, system design, operation workflows, implementation of QFaaS, and lessons learned on the benefits and limitations of quantum serverless computing. We also present practical use cases with various quantum applications on todayâs quantum computers and simulators to demonstrate our framework capability to facilitate the ongoing quantum software transition.",

Since more and more products for build automation have entered the market and existing tools have changed their functional scope, there is nowadays a large number of tools on the market that differ greatly in their functional scope. Based on requirements from our partner company, a build server analysis was conducted. This paper presents our analysis requirements, a detailed look at one of the examined tools and a summarized comparison of two tools.",

It is a technology intensive concept that has the ambition of achieving and maintaining âfirst-time-rightâ quality goals in spite of varying processes and input material. As a result, developing ZDM applications might become overwhelming for small enterprises due to the multitude of diverse platform, the lack of know-how, and the need to adapt general purpose solutions to meet their needs. The Big Data Innovation and Research Excellence (Bi-Rex) is an Italian consortium that aims to accelerate the industrial innovation process of small enterprises. Within this consortium we developed a Big Data platform that enables adaptive analytics at the IT/OT boundary by leveraging innovative solutions for the safe and automatic deployment of data-driven apps, using MLOps and DevOps techniques and technologies, and evaluated it in real use cases provided by the world leading industrial partners involved in the project.",

To ease the development process, continuous pipelines for AI have become an active research area where consolidated and in-depth analysis regarding the terminology, triggers, tasks, and challenges is required.\nThis paper includes a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) where we consolidated 151 relevant formal and informal sources. In addition, nine-semi structured interviews with participants from academia and industry verified and extended the obtained information. Based on these sources, this paper provides and compares terminologies for Development and Operations (DevOps) and Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Delivery (CD) for AI, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), (end-to-end) lifecycle management, and Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML). Furthermore, the paper provides an aggregated list of potential triggers for reiterating the pipeline, such as alert systems or schedules. In addition, this work uses a taxonomy creation strategy to present a consolidated pipeline comprising tasks regarding the continuous development of AI. This pipeline consists of four stages: Data Handling, Model Learning, Software Development and System Operations. Moreover, we map challenges regarding pipeline implementation, adaption, and usage for the continuous development of AI to these four stages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nContext:\nCausal probabilistic graph-based models have gained widespread utility, enabling the modeling of cause-and-effect relationships across diverse domains. With their rising adoption in new areas, such as safety analysis of complex systems, software engineering, and machine learning, the need for an integrated lifecycle framework akin to DevOps and MLOps has emerged. Currently, such a reference for organizations interested in employing causal engineering is missing. This lack of guidance hinders the incorporation and maturation of causal methods in the context of real-life applications.\nObjective:\nThis work contextualizes causal model usage across different stages and stakeholders and outlines a holistic view of creating and maintaining them within the process landscape of an organization.\nMethods:\nA novel lifecycle framework for causal model development and application called CausalOps is proposed. By defining key entities, dependencies, and intermediate artifacts generated during causal engineering, a consistent vocabulary and workflow model to guide organizations in adopting causal methods are established.\nResults:\nBased on the early adoption of the discussed methodology to a real-life problem within the automotive domain, an experience report underlining the practicability and challenges of the proposed approach is discussed.\nConclusion:\nIt is concluded that besides current technical advancements in various aspects of causal engineering, an overarching lifecycle framework that integrates these methods into organizational practices is missing. Although diverse skills from adjacent disciplines are widely available, guidance on how to transfer these assets into causality-driven practices still need to be addressed in the published literature. CausalOpsâ aim is to set a baseline for the adoption of causal methods in practical applications within interested organizations and the causality community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the present times, the practices of DevOps have become important due to the growing data and the dynamic traffic to the various applications at the user end. The software deployment into the production environment is the start of the process of deployment. From there, the product has to be monitored every time securely and initiate new versions of it. Moreover, it is also important to consider the functioning of the product along with customer satisfaction is important for consistent development. The application of DevOps practices using OpenShift is enhanced in this work. There is no single unified tool that performs the automation of build, testing and deploying pipelines. An ample amount of time is required to rebuild the pipeline for the deployment of the various versions of the code. Additionally, it is a tedious task to manage multiple tools and connect them for integration. Debugging the errors is also a difficult task. Red Hat OpenShift is the unified product for the complete process of automation starting from the development of the code to the deployment of the product on the servers. It is very important in the current time to have an agile and faster process of end-user deployment. Hence, the automated deployment practice with OpenShift will enhance the speed and delivery of the projects in the production environment. The proposed methodology will ensure the running of the standard deployment strategy, in an automated way which makes the process of deployment to be very advanced and automated. It ensures to be the single tool, which adds multiple benefits and ensures that the deployment of containers is performed in the cluster environment.",

We found 40 studies related to documentation practices and challenges, and 23 studies related to tools used in CSD. The challenges include: informal documentation is hard to understand, documentation is considered as waste, productivity is measured by working software only, documentation is out-of-sync with the software and there is a short-term focus. The practices include: non-written and informal communication, the usage of development artifacts for documentation, and the use of architecture frameworks. We also made an inventory of numerous tools that can be used for documentation purposes in CSD. Overall, we recommend the usage of executable documentation, modern tools and technologies to retrieve information and transform it into documentation, and the practice of minimal documentation upfront combined with detailed design for knowledge transfer afterwards.\nConclusion:\nIt is of paramount importance to increase the quantity and quality of documentation in CSD. While this remains challenging, practitioners will benefit from applying the identified practices and tools in order to mitigate the stated challenges.",

At the same time, a considerable amount of gray literature exists on IaC. Thus we aim to characterize IaC and compile a catalog of best and bad practices for widely used IaC languages, all using gray literature materials.\nMethod:\nIn this paper, we systematically analyze the industrial gray literature on IaC, such as blog posts, tutorials, white papers using qualitative analysis techniques.\nResults:\nWe proposed a definition for IaC and distilled a broad catalog summarized in a taxonomy consisting of 10 and 4 primary categories for best practices and bad practices, respectively, both language-agnostic and language-specific ones, for three IaC languages, namely Ansible, Puppet, and Chef. The practices reflect implementation issues, design issues, and the violation of/adherence to the essential principles of IaC.\nConclusion:\nOur findings reveal critical insights concerning the top languages as well as the best practices adopted by practitioners to address (some of) those challenges. We evidence that the field of development and maintenance IaC is in its infancy and deserves further attention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPasswords play a crucial role in authentication, ensuring that only authorised entities can access sensitive information. However, user password choices are often weak and predictable, making them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Additionally, hard-coded credentials in source code can expose organisations and infrastructure to significant risks. This paper explores the patterns of passwords used by developers, examining their similarities to those of typical users. We also investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in identifying hard-coded credentials in source code. Our findings suggest that developers foster more complex and, hence, more secure password selection patterns than regular users. Nevertheless, they can use worse patterns when the context allows them. The latter, combined with the ample commits in public code repositories containing secrets, exemplifies the need for more targeted awareness campaigns and tighter integration of code security tools in the development lifecycle. Finally, we explore the capacity of LLMs to detect hard-coded credentials, highlighting their differences and limitations.",

Changes are due to strategic factors like growth, regulations, mergers & acquisitions, diversification, geo-politics and business innovations etc. Sometimes change or innovation could be technology led also. For any business change or innovation to be deployed in practice, it must be developed (built) and operationalized and run as business as usual (BAU). This paper presents a systemic design based on Systems engineering and cybernetics principles. A systemic approach was adopted to re-inforce and establish connect between development and operations functions in delivering an organizational program of customer contact transformation.\nThis paper also leverages experience of deploying the same to overcome the challenges of lack of collaboration between Development and Operations silos in delivering changes in programs. This systemic model described here was implemented successfully for enhancing synergy of Development and Operations functions of a customer contact program of a major telecommunications services provider in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region operating in more than ten markets. Key stakeholders from DevOps were involved during the surveys conducted and assessment done. The approach involved discovery, diagnosis and design iterations in onsite and offshore model. It also presents a case, which deployed this approach, provides conclusion and future direction. Results of application of above approach to address the problem are also illustrated. The approach helped in reinforcing collaboration between the DevOps resulting in enhanced synergy, productivity and reduced time to market of telecom products and services considerably.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nModern industries widely rely upon software and IT services, in a context where cybercrime is rapidly spreading in more and more sectors. Unfortunately, despite greater general awareness of security risks and the availability of security tools that can help to cope with those risks, many organizations (especially medium/small-size ones) still lag when it comes to building security into their services. This is mainly due to the limited security skills of common developers/IT project managers and to the typically high costs of security procedures. In fact, while automated tools exist to perform code analysis, vulnerability scanning, or security testing, the manual intervention of security experts is still required not only for security analysis and design, but also to configure and elaborate the output of the security testing tools.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel secure software development methodology aimed at supporting developers from security design to security testing, suitable for integration within modern DevOps pipelines according to a DevSecOps (or SecDevOps) approach. The proposed methodology leverages a model-based process that enables identifying existing threats, selecting appropriate countermeasures to enforce, and verify their mitigation effectiveness through both static assessment procedures and targeted security tests. To demonstrate our approach's feasibility and concretely illustrate the devised activities, we provide a step-by-step description of the whole process concerning a containerized microservice-based application case study. In addition, we discuss the application of the proposed methodology, in its threat modeling and security testing phases, to a well-known vulnerable web application widely used for security training purposes, to illustrate that we can identify most of the existing vulnerabilities and determine appropriate test plans to assess and mitigate such vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nProject management has long been a challenge for Information Technology (IT) organizations to learn how to manage projects effectively and efficiently while balancing the iron triangle: cost, time and scope without sacrificing quality. Agile project management (APM) and traditional project management (TPM) are two different approaches related to software development, the core tenet of TPM is that projects are relatively simple, predictable, and linear with well-defined boundaries, whereas APM has emerged as a new methodology for managing high-risk, time-sensitive and scope flexible projects. While it is undeniable that the use of agile project management is increasing, the traditional opposite side continues to exist. The agile approach has an impact on all phases of software development, and they must adapt to this new way of thinking. Software testing is also impacted as a fundamental link in the software development life cycle that ensures quality. Software testing is a vital component of software Quality Assurance (QA) since it serves as the final review of the specification, design, and code. Has software testing evolved along with the evolution of project management? Is there a difference between a traditional and an agile software testing? This paper answers these questions by comparing software testing in the two approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIndustrial automation systems are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is caused by the higher proportion of software, networking, and cyber capability. Modern software-defined industrial automation systems provide higher flexibility and adaptivity against market uncertainty in dynamic and heterogeneous environmental conditions in industrial automation. Consequently, different conventional assets need changes during their life cycle to be adaptable. There are different ways to implement the required changes to reach the previously defined requirements such as systemsâ software changes which have easier implementation. These options cause different levels of complexity that require a different amount of resources mainly time and cost. Achievement of the new requirements concurrently induces a large amount of complexity. The omnipresent complexity gives rise to many consequences on different abstraction levels in software-defined systems. In order to manage these software-defined systems properly, an automatic method for estimating this complexity due to the importance of a proper selection among different possible modifications is required. This paper proposes a novel concept for a complexity estimation service before applying real changes in the systems. The presented method enables the simulation of required changes using the Intelligent Digital Twin concept to decrease the cost of real changing and implementation of the software and their unknown consequences besides acquiring the future requirements of asset management. By automatic complexity driversâ detection, this service simulates the new asset and predicts how it would be complex to apply the required changes by proper complexity metrics. To validate this service, an assistance system for a model car is implemented to show the complexity of software changes for adding new functionalities to the car.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nContext:\nAgile software companies applying the DevOps approach require collaboration and information sharing between practitioners in various roles to produce value. Adopting new development practices affects how practitioners collaborate, requiring companies to form a closer connection between business strategy and software development. However, the types of information management, sales, and development needed to plan, evaluate features, and reconcile their expectations with each other need to be clarified.\nObjective:\nTo support practitioners in collaborating and realizing changes to their practices, we investigated what information is needed and how it should be represented to support different stakeholders in their tasks. Compared to earlier research, we adopted a holistic approach â by including practitioners throughout the development process â to better understand the information needs from a broader viewpoint.\nMethod:\nWe conducted six workshops and 12 semi-structured interviews at three Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises from different software domains. Thematic analysis was used to identify information-related issues and information and visualization needs for daily tasks. Three themes were constructed as the result of our analysis.\nResults:\nVisual information representation catalyzes stakeholder discussion, and supporting information exchange between stakeholder groups is vital for efficient collaboration in software product development. Additionally, user-centric data collection practices are needed to understand how software products are used and to support practitionersâ daily information needs. We also found that a passive way of representing information, such as a dashboard that would disturb practitioners only when attention is needed, was preferred for daily information needs.\nConclusion:\nThe software engineering community should consider reviewing the information needs of practitioners from a more holistic view to better understand how tooling support can benefit information exchange between stakeholder groups when making product development decisions and how those tools should be built to accommodate different stakeholder views.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe increasing capabilities of mobile devices have led to the emergence of new paradigms exploiting them. These paradigms foster the onload and distribution of functionalities on mobile devices, allowing the development of distributed mobile applications. This distribution reduces the latency and the data traffic overhead and improves privacy. As in any other mobile application, their success largely depends on the quality of service (QoS) they offer. Nevertheless, the evaluation of distributed mobile applications is particularly complex due to the number, heterogeneity, and interactions between the devices involved. Current techniques allow developers to assess the quality of a single device, but they are not designed for highly heterogeneous, distributed, and collaborative environments. This paper presents a framework called Perses, which allows the creation of virtual scenarios with multiple heterogeneous mobile devices to launch end-to-end tests to evaluate not only each device but also the interactions among them. The framework was evaluated against a real deployment, showing that the behavior and the quality attributes measured are similar to those of the real deployment, allowing developers to evaluate these applications before launching them. Finally, Perses was integrated into a DevOps methodology to automate its execution and further facilitate its adoption by software companies.",

To exploit this potential, flexible and scalable platforms are needed to ease the design, development, deployment, and operations of new city services. In recent years, several problem-specific platforms have been proposed in different application domains; however, to boost the evolution of smart cities, we claim the need for city-oriented platforms that can be easily customized to address different day-to-day life challenging problems. In this paper, we present the main architectural challenges and solutions proposed for the design of a novel open-source platform (named PROMENADE) characterized by: i) a data-driven graph-based modeling support to ensure high generality for addressing disparate problems related to the networked nature of many city infrastructures and systems, ii) the dynamic nature of the graph entities updated in real-time from different sources (e.g., IoT/Edge networks, data providers, etc.), and iii) high efficiency, scalability and flexibility to easily support new city services. The platform is designed around a general-purpose core that provides a set of built-in standard features such as data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization exposed as a collection of containerized microservices. A specialization of the platform has been developed for road networks monitoring. It has been deployed in OpenShift/Kubernetes and tested using realistic datasets collected from the city of Lyon, France. The analysis addresses an important problem of big data processing pipelines: the synchronization between data ingestion and processing in order to produce an accurate result in useful time. To this end, we study different approaches for synchronization and show how the end-to-end latency is kept under control by leveraging the scalability of the platform.",

A novel framework for shaping a manufacturing strategy for the future Industry 5.0 paradigm is proposed. The I5.0 strategy framework consists of two main elements: (1) a process model and (2) a system model. The process model is based on the Design and Operations (DesOps) methodology while the system model discusses a fluid physical system as well as a fluid cyber system as relevant components of an I5.0 manufacturing system-of-systems. The research intends to contribute to the academic and industrial discussion towards forming a more practical guideline for managing the emerging I5.0 approaches and related technologies and to enable manufacturing companies to improve and maintain their competitiveness in a future I5.0 environment. Additionally, the authors aim to expand the knowledge foremost in the research field of strategy design and implementation by providing a decision-support framework for facilitating sustainable, resilient, and human-centric value creation.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (254KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has gained significant use over the last decade due to its several benefits, including cost savings associated with setup, deployments, delivery, physical resource sharing across virtual machines, and availability of on-demand cloud services. However, in addition to usual threats in almost every computing environment, cloud computing has also introduced a set of new threats as consumers share physical resources due to the physical co-location paradigm. Furthermore, since there are a growing number of attacks directed at cloud environments (including dictionary attacks, replay code attacks, denial of service attacks, rootkit attacks, code injection attacks, etc.), customers require additional assurances before adopting cloud services. Moreover, the continuous integration and continuous deployment of the code fragments have made cloud services more prone to security breaches. In this study, the model based on the root of trust for continuous integration and continuous deployment is proposed, instead of only relying on a single sign-on authentication method that typically uses only id and password. The underlying study opted hardware security module by utilizing the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is commonly available as a cryptoprocessor on the motherboards of the personal computers and data center servers. The preliminary proof of concept demonstrated that the TPM features can be utilized through RESTful services to establish the root of trust for continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline and can additionally be integrated as a secure microservice feature in the cloud computing environment.",

Indian classical music is unique in its requirement for rigorous, disciplined, expert-led training that typically goes on for years before the learner can reach a reasonable level of performance. This keeps many, including the first author of this paper, away from mastering the skill. The problem is particularly compounded in rural areas, where the available expertise may be limited and prohibitively expensive, but the interest in learning classical music still prevails, nevertheless. Machine Learning has been complementing, enhancing, and replacing many white-collar jobs and we believe it can help with this problem as well. This paper describes efforts at using Machine Learning techniques, particularly, Long Short-Term Memory for building a system that is a step toward provisioning an Indian Classical Music Tutor for the masses. The system is deployed in the cloud using orchestrated containerization for potential worldwide access, load balancing, and other robust features.",

There are many challenges related to automation of different IT operations to support continuous services up time. The story of current paper has been started a couple years ago, when a novel EAF approach has been designed. The main scope of this approach is decreasing of implementation time of automation of IT operation using model-driven paradigm and reusable functions. Based on first results of approbation of EAF, a survey has been developed to get opinions about challenges of automation and possible EAF improvement topics. Current paper provides results of mentioned survey where more than 40 IT companies provide the opinion about challenges in continuous services automation. Based on these results, EAF improvement topics are defined. All these topics are devoted to make EAF approach more useful and friendly for IT companies of Latvia, taking in account needs and challenges of mentioned companies.",

This paper focuses on supporting complex edge application interactions, which span different layers and subsystems in edge-cloud environments. This paper addresses (i) diverse types of software components for emulating realistic functionality and configurations, like data transformation and service API interoperability, and (ii) techniques for connecting emulated scenarios to real edge software development and operations, and to IoT and cloud counterparts. We present IoTCloudSamples  as a software framework with (i) modeling and implementation of diverse types of IoT, edge and cloud elements for complex edge scenarios, (ii) methods for constructing and steering emulations to study the interoperability across layers among different edge platforms and protocols, and (iii) extensive emulated scenarios and experiments integrated with real-world IoT and cloud services. IoTCloudSamples  supports the approach of edge-simulation-as-code to allow the reuse and runtime steering of realistic emulation operations.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe significance of collaboration between developers and operators has increased through service lifecycles, as they are expected to explore their clientsâ pains and co-create new ICT systems for their business opportunities through a number of trials. However, such agile development has caused conflicts with the conventional development management, which assumes waterfall development. This development process is administrated by the progress of documents statuses, such as created, reviewed, updated, and finalized, at development sites. This paper introduces a document-concern-design model to indicate developers their associated tasks to update specific sections of documents during their repetitive work between development and operation. The model incorporates three domains - document review process, concern, and design principle - with linking them one-by-one and form a single structure. This procedure enables to adapt any on-site local rule of design and development. Hence, the system can be introduced to any developersâ site with little adaptation cost. Then, this mechanism can accelerate various collaborative activities between developers and operators and guide their deliverables.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nManaging cloud applications running on IaaS is complicated and error prone. This is why DevOps tools and application description languages have been emerging. While these tools and languages enable the user to define the application and communication structure based on application components, they lack the possibility to define sophisticated communication patterns including the wiring on instance level. This paper details these shortcomings and presents approaches to overcome them. In particular, they we propose (i) adding boundaries to wiring specifications and (ii) introducing a higher-level abstractionâcalled facetâon top of the application. The combination of both concepts allows specifying wiring on basis of logical units and their relations. Hence, the concepts overcome general wiring problems that currently exist in cloud orchestration tools. In addition to that, the introduction of facets improves the re-use of components across different applications.",

Software engineering competencies (SEC) are considered the backbone of successfully developing software products. Consequently, SEC has become a hotspot for software engineering research and practice. Although scientific literature on SEC is not lacking, to our knowledge, a comprehensive overview of the current state of SEC research is missing. To that end, we conducted an extensive and systematic review of the SEC literature. We provide an overview of the current state of research on SEC, with a particular focus on common SEC research areas. In addition to reporting the available SEC models and frameworks, we compile a list of 49 unique essential competencies of software professionals. Finally, we highlight several gaps in the literature that deserve further research. In particular, we call for a better understanding of how the essential competencies of software professionals change over time, as well as fresh accounts of the essential competencies of software professionals. Additionally, considering recent shifts toward Agile and DevOps methods, future research must explore the competencies required for developing software products in modern development environments.",

Companies that have adopted CD have reported significant benefits. Motivated by these benefits, many companies would like to adopt CD. However, adopting CD can be very challenging for a number of reasons, such as obtaining buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders whose goals may seemingly be different fromâor even conflict withâour own; gaining sustained support in a dynamic complex enterprise environment; maintaining an application development team's momentum when their application's migration to CD requires an additional strenuous effort over a long period of time; and so on. To help overcome the adoption challenges, I present six strategies: (1) selling CD as a painkiller; (2) establishing a dedicated team with multi-disciplinary members; (3) continuous delivery of continuous delivery; (4) starting with the easy but important applications; (5) visual CD pipeline skeleton; (6) expert drop. These strategies were derived from four years of experience in implementing CD at a multi-billion-euro company. Additionally, our experience led to the identification of eight further challenges for research. The information contributes toward building a body of knowledge for CD adoption.",

Expectant parents must be better prepared to deal with fear and stress during early labour. There is a need for evidence-based information and digital applications that can empower couples during childbirth.\nObjective\nTo develop and identify requirements for a practice-based mobile health (mHealth) application for Digital Early Labour Support.\nMethods\nThis research started with creating an expert group composed of a multidisciplinary team capable of informing the app development process on evidence-based practices. In consultation with the expert group, the app was built using an agile development approach (i.e., Scrum) within a continuous software engineering setting (i.e., CI/CD, DevOps), also including user and security tests.\nResults\nDuring the development of the Early Labour App, two main types of challenges emerged: (1) user challenges, related to understanding the usersâ needs and experience with the app, and (2) team challenges, related to the software development team in particular, and the necessary skills for translating an early labour intervention into a digital solution. This study reaffirms the importance of midwife support via blended care and the opportunity of complementing it with an app. The Early Labour App was easy to use, the women needed little to no help, and the partnerâs preparation was facilitated. The combination of the app together with blended care opens up awareness, thoughts and feelings about the method and provides good preparation for the birth.\nConclusion\nWe propose the creation of the Early Labour App, a mHealth app for early labour support. The preliminary tests conducted for the Early Labour App show that the app is mature, allowing it to be used in the projectâs Randomised Control Trial, which is already ongoing.",

However, the need for high-level quantum programming abstractions and targeted use cases paired with vertical applications, which can directly benefit from quantum computing, remains an open challenge. This paper presents our vision for a decentralized architecture for swarm based IoT systems that leverages a high-level continuous development and integration quantum programming suite to support edge processing capabilities for different use cases across the edge-fog-cloud continuum. The planned Quantum DevKit provides the necessary abstractions and low-level backend interfaces for quantum computing infrastructure, enabling edge computation using quantum processing, with extensions to efficient management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The paper focuses on the presentation of the development kit and its coupling swarm-based architecture that automates the orchestration of the cloud-to-edge continuum, showcasing the potential of quantum technology in edge processing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomated, secure software development is an important digitalization task, solved with the DevSecOps approach. An important part of the DevSecOps approach is continuous risk assessment, which is necessary to identify and evaluate risk factors. Combining the development cycle with continuous risk assessment creates software development and operation synergies and minimizes vulnerabilities. The article presents the main methods of deploying web applications and ways to increase information security at all stages of product development. It also compares different types of infrastructures and cloud computing providers and analyzes modern tools used to automate processes. The cloud cluster was deployed using Terraform and the Jenkins pipeline, written in the Groovy programming language, which checks program code for vulnerabilities and allows you to fix violations at the earliest stages of developing secure web applications. The developed cluster implements the proposed algorithm for automated risk assessment based on the calculation (modeling) of cloud infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities, which operates in real-time, periodically collecting all information and adjusting the system according to the risk and applied controls. The algorithm for calculating risk and losses is based on statistical data and FAIR information risk assessment methodology. The risk value obtained using the proposed method is quantitative, which allows more efficient forecasting of information security costs in software development.",

The success of land cover classification models largely hinges on the data quality, coupled with the application of Big Data techniques and distributed computing. This is essential for efficiently processing the extensive volume of available satellite data. However, maintaining the lifecycle of several annual Machine Learning models presents a complex challenge. The rise of Machine Learning Operations offers an opportunity to automate the maintenance of these models, a feature particularly beneficial in systems that require generating new models each year alongside the continuous integration of validated data. This article details the development of an end-to-end MLOps workflow, meticulously integrating land cover classification models that employ Big Data strategies for processing large-scale, high-resolution spatial data. The workflow is designed within a Kubernetes environment, achieving on-demand auto-scaling, distributed computing, and load balancing. This integration demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of managing and deploying models that treat satellite imagery in an automated, scalable framework, thus marking a significant advancement in remote sensing and MLOps.",

Support for automation is especially relevant when dealing with ML deployments characterised by the continuous delivery of ML models. Taking automation in MLOps systems as an example, we present novel metrics that offer reliable insights into support for this vital quality attribute, validated by ordinal regression analysis. Our method introduces novel, technology-agnostic metrics aligned with typical Architectural Design Decisions (ADDs) for automation in MLOps. Through systematic processes, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in evaluating automation-related ADDs and decision options. Our approach can itself be automated within continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines. It can also be modified and extended to evaluate any relevant architectural quality aspects, thereby assisting in enhancing compliance with non-functional requirements and streamlining development, quality assurance and release cycles.",

One major challenge for engineers is adhering to the correct process that is applicable in their specific working context, to understand which steps are ready to start, what actions are missing to complete their step, and when rework has happened. In this paper, we propose and evaluate ProGuide, a framework that provides actionable, light-weight process guidance by continuously assessing pre-conditions, post-conditions, and QA constraints. In case of a violation, it provides concrete repair actions. Evaluation on a safety-critical open source system and engineers from our industry partner Bosch showed that repairs are complete and small in number, and resulted in less frustration and fewer mistakes compared to being provided with no process guidance.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.",

CSE addresses the need to increase flexibility and short release cycles, especially when augmenting software as a service, without jeopardizing software quality.\nPurpose/objectives\nâ Empirical literature focuses on the transition to CSE as introducing a new method supported by new tools and architectural concepts. Little is known, however, about how software companies sustain CSE practices.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nâ The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, we present a thematic analysis based on qualitative interviews with both management and developers from three different software development organizations. Then we apply the concept of infrastructuring to the results as a sense-making device.\nFindings\n- We show how companies adapt and align their CSE organization, processes, and techniques to internal and external demands and conditions, resulting in widely varying practices. We further see that CSE in the companies is unlikely to arrive at a stable state. Rather, the companies continuously adapt their practices due to changes in the environment, requirements, new techniques and tools, and new software dependencies.\nImplications/value\nâ We use the concept of âinfrastructuringâ from computer supported cooperative work and information systems to make sense of the continuous change we see in our interviews. We show that CSE needs to be regarded as a new way to make use of method (elements), processes and tools in software engineering, rather than a new method.",

This evolved into Cloud computing where the possibility for cost reduction and scalable data storage became a reality. With the introduction of cloud computing came a concept known as NoOps, or No Operations. This paper aims to take a closer look into what NoOps is and the benefits and challenges of NoOps. The authors identified three RQs that could help to give more insight into NoOps. Further we discussed the findings and RQs and lay out the way forward for future studies into NoOps. We also looked at artificial intelligence (AI) and how AI seems to be heavily linked with a true NoOps environment. With the lack of scientific studies into NoOps, a Multivocal literature review was selected as the method used to investigate the concept and its implications. We try to show voices both for and against NoOps. Further, we try to look at a misconception of what NoOps really is, what true NoOps could be. Finally we look at what requirements there are for companies wanting to go NoOps, and discuss the possibility that many companies unknowingly are moving towards a NoOps environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe fourth industrial revolution advocates the reformulation of industrial processes to achieve the end-to-end (provider-customer) digitalisation of the industrial sector. As is well known, the industrial environment is very complex, where legacy systems must interoperate and integrate with modern devices and sensors. Communication among them requires specific and costly developments, so architectures based on data sharing and services implementation are considered one of the most flexible and appropriate technological solutions to gradually achieve the desired horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain. The design and deployment of data-intensive applications is not straightforward, therefore this paper proposes a model-based tool to characterise the different elements to be configured in an application and to make its deployment easier by generating configuration, orchestration and deployment files and sending them to the corresponding nodes for their execution. In few words, this article highlights the advantages of distributed and data-centric architectures to face the challenge of integration and interoperability in data-intensive complex systems and presents the extension of the RAI4 metamodel proposed in MartÃ­nez et al. (2021) that now allows specifying how, containerised or not, and where, on the cloud, fog, edge or on-premise, each service can be hosted according to its functional and non-functional requirements, mainly issues related with real-time, security and cyber physical hardware dependencies. For the sake of comprehension, a pseudo-real use case addressed to pre-process and store pollution data from environmental sensors installed in a smart city is described in detail, including different deployment settings.",

This incremental development may result in the deterioration of certain quality aspects. In other words, the software can be considered an evolving entity emanating different quality characteristics as it gets updated over time with new features or deployed in different operational environments. Approaching software development with this mindset and awareness regarding quality evolution over time can be a key factor for the long-term success of a company in todayâs highly competitive market of industrial software-intensive products. Therefore, it is important to be able to accurately analyze and determine the quality implications of each change and increment to a software system. To address this challenge, the multinational SmartDelta project develops automated solutions for the quality assessment of product deltas in a continuous engineering environment. The project provides smart analytics from development artifacts and system executions, offering insights into quality degradation or improvements across different product versions, and providing recommendations for the next builds. This paper presents the challenges in incremental software development tackled in the scope of the SmartDelta project, and the solutions that are produced and planned in the project, along with the industrial impact of the project for software-intensive industrial systems.",

In addition, heterogeneous and short-term changing customer needs even within the product life cycle require a change of the innovation approach. To address these challenges, continuous innovation has become increasingly important. It supports to overcome the shortening of product life cycles, minimizes the need for effort-intensive development for new products and thus contributes to sustainability. Although the importance of continuous innovation for technical products in the usage phase has already been recognized, there is no comprehensive and sufficient understanding of this approach. Existing definitions fail to provide a detailed and holistic description of the innovation characteristics and features. Consequently, manufacturing companies face difficulties in the operational implementation of continuous innovation. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a unified and systematic characterization of continuous innovation for technical products in the usage phase. The definition is based on the five dimensions of innovation content, innovation subject, innovation intensity, innovation process and innovation stakeholders as well as their respective characteristics. The resulting unified and systematic characterizing definition of continuous innovation supports manufacturing companies in the design of their specific approach of continuous innovation and its operative implementation.",

However, the ever-changing abundance of information in both course and job platforms makes it difficult for job seekers to identify the right learning resources for a particular job opportunity. As a result, it is important to integrate and analyze information from both platforms to recommend suitable courses and jobs to them. Meanwhile, integrating information from these distinct platforms for analysis purposes poses a challenge due to the presentation of data in free text. Previous studies have mainly focused on downstream tasks in one area and few have integrated both of them. Additionally, linking skills from these platforms through methods such as crowdsourcing or annotation mechanisms may not be reliable due to potential biases or inconsistencies. This study proposes a novel approach to integrate data from course and job advertising platforms using graph representation learning and embedding algorithms. The proposed approach predicts the relationship between the two platforms and has been tested in the form of link prediction tasks using several graph learning methods with RMSE scores below 0.1 and AUC scores between 70-75%. These results imply that our approach can be further refined and has the potential to be used in building recommendation systems that help address the problem of information overload among students and job seekers.",

We conduct an exploratory case study in a large software organization to investigate how the development paradigm and the formality of communication channels affect written communication within hybrid teams. We perform statistical and content analysis of written conversations from 20 projects involving two software products that use industry adaptations of the Waterfall model and of Scrum, respectively. We found that in agile-developed projects, communication related to the execution-monitoring-control phase of the Project Management Life Cycle is more prevalent, and communication related to the initiation phase occurs more frequently in informal channels. For both project types, communication primarily pertains to the software construction phase of the Software Development Life Cycle. After annotating communication contents using speech acts, representatives are found to be prevalent in informal channels for agile-developed projects, directives are more prevalent in informal channels for waterfall-developed projects, and expressives are more frequent in informal channels for both project types. We provide empirical evidence that development paradigms and communication channel formality impact written communication, with agile-developed projects showing more collaborative interactions in informal channels compared to waterfall-developed projects.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nContext\nThe increasing use of software and information technology in modern society requires that the deployment of IT solutions should be more efficient and controlled. In this sense, agile methodologies are essential to achieve this goal, but a relevant question arises: Which is the right methodology for reaching that goal?\nObjective\nThe purpose of the research was to study the prioritization of agile practices and improvement objectives in the context of software development, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. For this purpose, 42 agile practices, 16 improvement objectives, 4 organizations dedicated to software development in Colombia and 40 professionals in the area of information and communication technologies in the same country were considered.\nMethod\nology: The methodological approach used was mixed. On the one hand, we applied a quantitative approach for the treatment of data with the AHP method and, on the other hand, a qualitative analysis by consulting experts through a digital survey to validate the prioritization of the improvement objectives. Questionpro was used as a support tool for multicriteria comparison.\nResults\nThe main results show that applying AHP allowed us to prioritize 6 improvement objectives and 5 agile practices, where it is highlighted that the prioritization does not discard the other objects of comparison but allows us to put into practice the prioritized elements to favor their progressive implementation. The non-prioritized elements could be part of future iterations of multicriteria comparison that go hand in hand with capacity development and organizational maturity models in the context of global software development.\nConclusion\nIt is highlighted that, although there is evidence of the application of multi-criteria comparison methods in the software development industry, this work applies such methods in the context of four different agile methodologies, which translates into a precedent for the conformation of hybrid methodological approaches.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nWe present an automated approach for evaluating the layout of UML class diagrams.\nâ¢\nFor 75.4% of the diagrams, our evaluator was not more than 10% away from the actual.\nâ¢\nWe ranked the most important aesthetic characteristics of diagram layout quality.\nâ¢\nWe share a dataset of 609 manually labeled class diagrams.\nAbstract\nUML is the de facto standard notation for graphically representing software. UML diagrams are used in the analysis, construction, and maintenance of software systems. Mostly, UML diagrams capture an abstract view of a (piece of a) software system. A key purpose of UML diagrams is to share knowledge about the system among developers. The quality of the layout of UML diagrams plays a crucial role in their comprehension.\nIn this paper, we present an automated method for evaluating the layout quality of UML class diagrams. We use machine learning based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. Such an automated evaluator has several uses: (1) From an industrial perspective, this tool could be used for automated quality assurance for class diagrams (e.g., as part of a quality monitor integrated into a DevOps toolchain). For example, automated feedback can be generated once a UML diagram is checked in the project repository. (2) In an educational setting, the evaluator can grade the layout aspect of student assignments in courses on software modeling, analysis, and design. (3) In the field of algorithm design for graph layouts, our evaluator can assess the layouts generated by such algorithms. In this way, this evaluator opens up the road for using machine learning to learn good layouting algorithms.\nApproach.\nWe use machine learning techniques to build (linear) regression models based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. As ground truth, we use a dataset of 600+ UML Class Diagrams for which experts manually label the quality of the layout.\nContributions.\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n(1) We show the feasibility of the automatic evaluation of the layout quality of UML class diagrams.\n(2) We analyze which features of UML class diagrams are most strongly related to the quality of their layout.\n(3) We evaluate the performance of our layout evaluator.\n(4) We offer a dataset of labeled UML class diagrams. In this dataset, we supply for every diagram the following information: (a) a manually established ground truth of the quality of the layout, (b) an automatically established value for the layout-quality of the diagram (produced by our classifier), and (c) the values of key features of the layout of the diagram (obtained by image processing). This dataset can be used for replication of our study and others to build on and improve on this work.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board..",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPublic scrutiny of platforms has been limited by a lack of transparency. In response, EU law increasingly requires platforms to provide data to researchers. The Digital Services Act and the proposed Regulation on the Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising in particular require platforms to provide access to data through ad libraries and in response to data access requests. However, these obligations leave platforms considerable discretion to determine how access to data is provided. As the history of platformsâ self-regulated data access projects shows, the technical choices involved in designing data access significantly affect how researchers can use the provided data to scrutinise platforms. Ignoring the way data access is designed therefore creates a danger that platformsâ ability to limit research into their services simply shifts from controlling what data is available to researchers, to how data access is provided. This article explores how the Digital Services Act and proposed Political Advertising Regulation should be used to control the operationalisation of data access obligations that enable researchers to scrutinise platforms. It argues the operationalisation of data access regimes should not only be seen as a legal problem, but also as a software design problem. To that end it explores how software development principles may inform the operationalisation of data access obligations. The article closes by exploring the legal mechanisms available in the Digital Services Act and proposed Political Advertising Regulation to exercise control over the design of data access regimes, and makes five recommendations for ways in which these mechanisms should be used to enable research into platforms.",

The parameter sensing provides local intelligence to the valve, which can be later used as a feedback signal for the controller. The hardware design includes ICS (Industrial Control Servo) valve with modifications to connect a Linear Variable Transformer (LVT) position sensor, pressure and temperature sensors. Also, a circuit board carrying the phase shift oscillator, Root Mean Square (RMS) to Direct Current (DC) converter, power supply and a dedicated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for transmitting the collected data is designed. The transmitted data can be received in a mobile phone android application and used for a secondary data calculation, alarm notification and alerting service technician. The sensor integration along with BLE connectivity creates a novel platform for data acquisition in Industrial Refrigeration (IR). The proposed method tested in real time to regulate the Helium gas flow rate and measured valve parameters is monitored by the dedicated mobile application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Western Balkans is experiencing an ongoing inflow of foreign direct investments (FDI) in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry as several European enterprises have already established their presence in the region. These inflows have generated large-scale ICT investments in the region, creating new knowledge-based clusters and technology spillovers in regional economies. On the basis of financial statement indicators collected for 327 European and regional ICT enterprises and on panel data estimation, this paper tries to estimate technology transfer in the Western Balkan region. Specifically, the proposed model examines cluster spillover effects in improving the absorptive capacity of the Western Balkan region in creating a pool of specialized local suppliers and a talented regional labor force. Model estimation results indicate that limited spillover effects have occurred from the newly created clusters of European ICT enterprises in the regional economy of the Western Balkan region. Spillovers related to improved technical capabilities, increased labor productivity, higher resource efficiency, and flexible operational structures require further stimulation to speed up convergence and integration of the local ICT industry in the corresponding European value chain. Finally, this paper concludes that competitive advantages such as a cheap labor force are no longer feasible for sustainable development. To narrow down the existing know-how gap, particular efforts are required regarding policies focused on educating human capital and transforming regional enterprises to successfully compete in the European market.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nWe consolidate 143 studies on software engineering aspects of A/B testing.\nâ¢\nWe present the different roles stakeholders take in A/B test design and execution.\nâ¢\nA/B testing has gained traction in fields like embedded and cyberâphysical systems.\nâ¢\nDespite automation trends, A/B testing still requires significant human involvement.\nAbstract\nA/B testing, also referred to as online controlled experimentation or continuous experimentation, is a form of hypothesis testing where two variants of a piece of software are compared in the field from an end userâs point of view. A/B testing is widely used in practice to enable data-driven decision making for software development. While a few studies have explored different facets of research on A/B testing, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the state-of-the-art in A/B testing. Such a study is crucial to provide a systematic overview of the field of A/B testing driving future research forward. To address this gap and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in A/B testing, this paper reports the results of a systematic literature review that analyzed primary studies. The research questions focused on the subject of A/B testing, how A/B tests are designed and executed, what roles stakeholders have in this process, and the open challenges in the area. Analysis of the extracted data shows that the main targets of A/B testing are algorithms, visual elements, and workflow and processes. Single classic A/B tests are the dominating type of tests, primarily based in hypothesis tests. Stakeholders have three main roles in the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup technician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B tests are product/system data, user-centric data, and spatio-temporal data. The dominating use of the test results are feature selection, feature rollout, continued feature development, and subsequent A/B test design. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution: experiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems are related to the enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. From our study we derived three interesting lines for future research: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in A/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation of A/B testing.",

However, exponential commercial investments in the private sector should not overlook the public interest and social value of this emerging technology powerhouse. The worldâs superpowers are also competing for leadership in AI and the contentious pursuit of artificial general intelligence. Collectively for commercial, social, and national interests, as well as internal and external stakeholders, it is vital to know, observe, understand, apply, adapt, and even critique an inclusive, evidence-based approach to conceptualize, assess risks, design, develop, and deploy an AI solution. This article presents the CDAC AI life cycle, a comprehensive approach that addresses and accounts for all challenges from conception to production of AI.\nSummary\nThis paper presents the âCDAC AI life cycle,â a comprehensive life cycle for the design, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and solutions. It addresses the void of a practical and inclusive approach that spans beyond the technical constructs to also focus on the challenges of risk analysis of AI adoption, transferability of prebuilt models, increasing importance of ethics and governance, and the composition, skills, and knowledge of an AI team required for successful completion. The life cycle is presented as the progression of an AI solution through its distinct phasesâdesign, develop, and deployâand 19 constituent stages from conception to production as applicable to any AI initiative. This life cycle addresses several critical gaps in the literature where related work on approaches and methodologies are adapted and not designed specifically for AI. A technical and organizational taxonomy that synthesizes the functional value of AI is a further contribution of this article.",

By adopting tracing tools, practitioners are able to monitor, debug, and optimize distributed software architectures easily. However, with excessive number of valid candidates, researchers and practitioners have a hard time finding and selecting the suitable tracing tools by systematically considering their features and advantages.\nObjective:\nTo such a purpose, this paper aims to provide an overview of popular Open tracing tools via comparison.\nMethods:\nHerein, we first identified 30 tools in an objective, systematic, and reproducible manner adopting the Systematic Multivocal Literature Review protocol. Then, we characterized each tool looking at the 1) measured features, 2) popularity both in peer-reviewed literature and online media, and 3) benefits and issues. We used topic modeling and sentiment analysis to extract and summarize the benefits and issues. Specially, we adopted ChatGPT to support the topic interpretation.\nResults:\nAs a result, this paper presents a systematic comparison amongst the selected tracing tools in terms of their features, popularity, benefits and issues.\nConclusion:\nThe result mainly shows that each tracing tool provides a unique combination of features with also different pros and cons. The contribution of this paper is to provide the practitioners better understanding of the tracing tools facilitating their adoption.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe security architecture of modern networks undergoes periodic changes, given (i) the diversity of security solutions, (ii) the emergence of new attack vectors, and (iii) corporate needs in terms of access control (ZTNA: Zero Trust Network Access). The complexity of setting up a secure infrastructure lies in the design of the network architecture, on the one hand, and the choice of configurations appropriate to the companyâs security policy, on the other. Indeed, misconfiguration is considered a vulnerability, which makes the task of setting up a secure network somewhat critical, given the technical skills it requires. In this paper, we will address this problem by proposing a modern security architecture applied to all sizes of enterprises: medium-sized, large, and sometimes even small companies. Therefore, we will describe the equipment required and their roles in the security layer, the security technologies adopted, and best practices for optimal deployment. To evaluate our proposal, we generated malicious traffic using the firewall inspection tester based on the âfit.pyâ script to study the architectureâs resilience and behavior in the face of multiple attacks.",

Agile methodologies emerged with the expectation of reducing the risk of software development project failure.\nObjective\nThis research aims to answer the following question: What are the human-related critical success factors for agile software development projects to succeed? The research model comprises four explanatory variables (team capability, customer involvement, psychological safety, and team autonomy) and one dependent variable (success of agile software development projects).\nMethod\nA questionnaire-based survey was carried out, resulting in 177 valid responses. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was performed to test the theoretical model.\nResults\nThe findings indicate that team capability and customer involvement have the strongest effects on the success of agile software development projects. The results also show that psychological safety is a significant indirect success factor and that team autonomy appears to have a competing dynamic with psychological safety on the other two factors.\nConclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the direct impact of psychological safety and its indirect effect, mediated by team capability and customer involvement, on the success of agile software development projects. The mediation, moderation, and direct effects are studied, offering theoretical and practical insights.",

One of the reasons is the lack of a structured regression testing process. In this regard, checklists can help practitioners keep track of essential regression testing activities and add structure to the regression testing process to a certain extent.\nObjective:\nThis study aims to introduce regression testing checklists so test managers/teams can use them: (1) to assess whether test teams/members are ready to begin regression testing, and (2) to keep track of essential regression testing activities while planning and executing regression tests.\nMethod:\nWe used interviews, workshops, and questionnaires to design, evolve, and evaluate regression testing checklists. In total, 25 practitioners from 12 companies participated in creating the checklist. Twenty-three of them participated in checklists evolution and evaluation.\nResults:\nWe identified activities practitioners consider significant while planning, performing, and analyzing regression testing. We designed regression testing checklists based on these activities to help practitioners make informed decisions during regression testing. With the help of practitioners, we evolved these checklists into two iterations. Finally, the practitioners provided feedback on the proposed checklists. All respondents think the proposed checklists are useful and customizable for their environments, and 80% think checklists cover aspects essential for regression testing.\nConclusion:\nThe proposed regression testing checklists can be useful for test managers to assess their team/team membersâ readiness and decide when to start and stop regression testing. The checklists can be used to record the steps required while planning and executing regression testing. Further, these checklists can provide a basis for structuring the regression testing process in varying contexts.",

At a high level, project management is not yet digitalized but technologies are used as tools to optimise project management processes. The results also highlight the need for continuous learning to adapt to the transformation introduced by digitalization.

It is inherently impractical to specify all the lawful interactions of these systems, in turn, the possibility of invalid interactions cannot be excluded at design time. As modern systems might harm people, or compromise assets if they fail, they ought to be accountable. Accountability is an interdisciplinary concept that cannot be easily described as a holistic technical property of a system. Thus, in this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach to enable accountability using goal-specific accountability mechanisms. Each mechanism provides forensic capabilities that help us to identify the root cause for a specific type of events, both to eliminate the underlying (technical) problem and to assign blame. This paper presents the different ingredients that are required to design and build an accountability mechanism and focuses on the technical and practical utilization of causality theories as a cornerstone to achieve our goal. To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks a systematic methodology to envision, design, and implement abilities that promote accountability in systems. With a case study from the area of microservice-based systems, which we deem representative of modern complex systems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach as a whole. We show that it is generic enough to accommodate different accountability goals and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques perform better than other regression test optimization techniques including Test Suite Reduction (TSR) and Test Case Selection (TCS). Many TCP techniques are available, and their performance is usually measured through a metric Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD). This metric is value-neutral because it only works well when all test cases have the same cost, and all faults have the same severity. Using APFD for performance evaluation of test case orders where test cases cost or faults severity varies is prone to produce false results. Therefore, using the right metric for performance evaluation of TCP techniques is very important to get reliable and correct results. In this paper, two value-based TCP techniques have been introduced using Genetic Algorithm (GA) including Value-Cognizant Fault Detection-Based TCP (VCFDB-TCP) and Value-Cognizant Requirements Coverage-Based TCP (VCRCB-TCP). Two novel value-based performance evaluation metrics are also introduced for value-based TCP including Average Percentage of Fault Detection per value (APFDv) and Average Percentage of Requirements Coverage per value (APRCv). Two case studies are performed to validate proposed techniques and performance evaluation metrics. The proposed GA-based techniques outperformed the existing state-of-the-art TCP techniques including Original Order (OO), Reverse Order (REV-O), Random Order (RO), and Greedy algorithm.",

As an aspect of digital twins, virtual commissioning models are used to test machines in the engineering phase, before they are even built.

In this paper, a concept is presented, for utilizing these models during the production phase in order to optimize the production process. In addition, simple geometrical faults can be detected in the virtual commissioning model and optimized before the control program of the product is deployed on the real machine.",

The minimal documentation emphasis may be beneficial in reducing time-to-market for software. However, it can also be a concern, especially with QRs, since they are challenging to specify and document and are crucial for software success. Therefore, understanding how practitioners perceive the importance of QR documentation is valuable because it can provide insight into how they approach this task. It also helps in developing models and guidelines that support the documentation of QRs in ASD, which is a research gap.\nObjective:\nWe aim to understand practitionersâ perceptions of QR documentation and factors influencing this task to derive a model that supports optimal QR documentation in ASD.\nMethod:\nWe conducted a multiple case study involving 12 participants from three cases that apply ASD.\nResults:\nPractitioners identify QR documentation as important and perceive it as contributing to ensuring quality, clarifying QRs, and facilitating decision-making. Time constraints, QR awareness, and communication gaps affect QR documentation. Missing and outdated QR documentation may lead to technical debt and a lack of common understanding regarding QRs. We introduce a model to support optimal QR documentation in ASD by focusing on the factors: time constraints, QR awareness, and communication gaps. The model provides a representation and explanation of the factors affecting QR documentation in ASD and identifies mitigation strategies to overcome issues that may occur due to these factors.\nConclusion:\nThe study reveals the importance of documenting QRs in ASD. It introduces a model that is based on empirical knowledge of QR documentation practices in ASD. Both practitioners and researchers can potentially benefit from the model. For instance, practitioners can analyze how time constraints or QR awareness affect documentation, see potential issues that may arise from them, and utilize strategies suggested by the model to address these issues. Researchers can learn about QR documentation in ASD and utilize the model to understand the topic. They can also use the study as a baseline to investigate the topic with other cases.",

Based on data from a qualitative field study in a software consultancy organization, this article examines how accountability is shaped by project teamsâ use of digital project management tools. The findings reveal that project teams actualize visibility and association affordances to configure accountability and reinforce shared accountability in client relationships. However, they are constrained by persistence affordance, which requires consistent and aligned digital transparency. This study demonstrates that the impacts of digital technologies on project accountability emerge from the actualization of affordances in specific technology practices, co-determined by the technology materiality and the accountability goals of project participants. Through visibility and association affordances, digital technologies can reinforce both hierarchical and socializing forms of accountability. However, this requires project participants to form a consensus on technology usage, binding them to each other's digital practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nMicroservices are a widely deployed pattern for implementing large-scale distributed systems. However, in order to harden the overall system and when crossing datacenter boundaries, the authenticity and confidentiality of microservice calls have to be secured even for internal calls. Since most microservice systems employ HTTP-based approaches, TLS communication is usually used to secure the communication channels. However, TLS by itself provides only link-level security. Authentication options are limited or alternatively must be implemented in the application code. As a result, microservice systems often lack proper defense in depth. In this paper we present how standard cryptographic primitives can be combined to provide a flexible communication system providing a high level of security even when easy to manage low-entropy authentication secrets are used. Furthermore, the approach provides encryption, forward secrecy and protection against replay attacks even for out-of-order communication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSoftware attributes analysis in industrial automation systems due to the higher proportion of using software-defined systems is highly significant. The requirement of higher flexibility, adaptivity, quality, less cost, and time to market as main classes of manufacturing attributes in dynamic and heterogeneous environments induce a large amount of complexity, which directly deteriorates the external software quality attributes. Complexity is a comprehension of quality management factor that influences the quality attributes of an asset such as testability, reusability, reliability, and maintainability. In order to manage the continuous requirement of software-defined systemsâ updating efficiently, an automatic method for estimating these quality attributes is required. This paper proposes a novel approach for quality attributes analysis with the factor of complexity estimation. The proposed approach is realized in a framework that exploits the operational simulation capability of the intelligent Digital Twin concept to decrease the cost of untoward consequences of complexity increase on software external attributes by using operational data. It uses the simulated asset to predict how complexity due to applying new changes would impact the software quality attributes. The quality analysis process contains the intelligence process of monitoring the complexity metrics vector and quality attributes vector, the analysis of training models, the prediction of attributes, and the evaluation of measurements to enhance the quality attributes in advance. A comprehensive evaluation using the example of a Robotino 3 Premium from Festo, an autonomous mobile robot, is used to show the consequences of changes in software quality attributes for validation of the proposed framework.",

Secondly, the identified problems were evaluated by Nokia gNB system-level test professionals in a dedicated survey.\nResults:\nThe questionnaire was completed by 312 out of 2935 (10.63%) possible respondents. The challenges are seen as the most important and urgent: customer scenario testing, performance testing, and competence ramp-up. Challenges seen as the most difficult to solve are low occurrence failures, hidden feature dependencies, and hardware configuration-specific problems.\nConclusions:\nOur research identified several improvement areas in the quality assurance processes used to develop the 5G technology by determining the most important and urgent problems that at the same time have a low perceived difficulty. Such initiatives are attractive from a business perspective. On the other hand, challenges seen as the most impactful yet difficult may be of interest to the academic research community.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (263KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

As such systems are known to quickly accumulate technical debt due to system-level interdependencies of code, data, and models, clear abstractions boundaries are mandatory. Therefore, this publication derives a systematic functional decomposition of an MLOps system tailored to the manufacturing industry into specific domains and contexts. Moreover, a concrete deployment view is provided, and possible future research directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) are gaining in popularity recently, notably since big tech giants announced they are using the technology. While the term is becoming popular, it is not new, and its ideas are even older. The research community has extensively studied knowledge Graphs in their various forms. Furthermore, the approach has been applied and proved valuable in many different applications. However, we found a lack of papers presenting the integration of KGs in a system regardless of the downstream application. We explore how KGs can fit in an overall information system independently from any specific use case, i.e., what we will consider knowledge consumption. We propose an architecture to understand better the KG roles within a system and how they can be integrated and implemented in a business context. We introduce each element of the latter architecture and discuss some candidate technology to implement them. Our work implements Knowledge Graph-Based Systems considering the constraints of a small to medium-sized enterprise.",

During the last five decades, software engineering has also changed significantly to advance the development of various types and scales of software products. In this context, Software Engineering Education plays an important role in keeping students updated with software technologies, processes, and practices that are popular in industries.\nObjective:\nWe investigate from literature the extent Software Engineering Education addresses major Software Engineering Trends in the academic setting.\nMethod:\nWe conducted a systematic mapping study about teaching major Software Engineering Trends in project courses. We classified 126 papers based on their investigated Software Engineering Trends, specifically Software Engineering processes and practices, teaching approaches, and the evolution of Software Engineering Trends over time.\nResults:\nWe reveal that Agile Software Development is the major trend. The other Trends, i.e., Software Implementation, Usability and Value, Global Software Engineering, and Lean Software Startup, are relatively small in the academic setting, but continuously growing in the last five years. System of Systems is the least investigated among all Trends.\nConclusions:\nThe study points out the possible gaps between Software Industry and Education, which implies actionable insights for researchers, educators, and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nAutonomous UAV systems are increasingly touted as the dominant future paradigm for inspecting civil infrastructure. Within this study, we have designed and developed a cloud system for high-level path planning, monitoring, and testing of autonomous UAV missions for inspecting infrastructures such as power lines, power towers, bridges, and railways. The software architecture is based on identified systemâs functional and non-functional requirements. The cloud system is intended for UAV inspection operators and therefore should support multiple concurrent users. The microservice architecture has assured independence between functionalities, allowing independent scaling resulting in the fast processing time of near-optimal route calculation for UAVs reaching inspection targets. Furthermore, the independence between the services facilitates feature addition and future development. The system robustness is assured by containerizing services and continuously deploying to the Kubernetes cluster distributed across multiple worker nodes. Kubernetes scaling properties have enabled multiple concurrent users regardless of heavy computations for inspection paths. Application load testing has resulted in low processing time when individual services are scaled. Calculated inspection paths are validated for real-world inspection by employing the UAV Gazebo simulation based on a 3D dynamic model with an onboard flight controller, leading the UAV through the waypoints provided by the cloud system. By containerizing the simulation and deploying it within the cluster, we have enabled developers and users to test paths before sending the real-world UAVs to the inspection.",

However, such execution views are frequently missing in real-world practices. Therefore, researchers have endeavored to reconstruct execution architecture views from software systems. However, existing approaches either require domain expertsâ knowledge or are applicable only to systems with particular architecture styles. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to reconstructing an execution architecture view, without prior knowledge of the components and connectors in the target system. With the proposed approach, by defining a candidate set of execution view connectors and mapping rules from source code to execution view connectors, developers can reconstruct an execution view. To evaluate the proposed approach, we applied it to three real-world software systems. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach reconstructs an execution architecture with a higher than 86 % F1-score and less than 13.9 person-hours.",

OWASP SAMM is a maturity model providing a versatile way for companies to assess their security posture and plan for improvements.\nObjective:\nWe perform an initial SAMM assessment in collaboration with a company in the financial domain. Our objective is to assess a holistic inventory of the company security-related activities, focusing on how different roles perform the assessment and how they perceive the instrument used in the process.\nMethodology:\nWe perform a case study to collect data using SAMM in a lightweight and novel manner through assessment using an online survey with 17 participants and a focus group with seven participants.\nResults:\nWe show that different roles perceive maturity differently and that the two assessments deviate only for specific practices making the lightweight approach a viable and efficient solution in industrial practice. Our results indicate that the questions included in the SAMM assessment tool are answered easily and confidently across most roles.\nDiscussion:\nOur results suggest that companies can productively use a lightweight SAMM assessment. We provide nine lessons learned for guiding industrial practitioners in the evaluation of their current security posture as well as for academics wanting to utilize SAMM as a research tool in industrial settings.\nEditorâs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.",

Despite the growing adoption of various scaling agile frameworks, there is little empirical evidence of how effective their practices are in mitigating risk, especially in global software development (GSD), where project failure is a known problem.\nIn this study, we develop a GSD Risk Catalog of 63 risks to assess the degree to which two scaling agile frameworksâDisciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) and the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)âaddress software project risks in GSD. We examined data from two longitudinal case studies implementing each framework to identify the extent to which the framework practices address GSD risks.\nScaling agile frameworks appear to help companies eliminate or mitigate many traditional risks in GSD, especially relating to users and customers. However, several important risks were not eliminated or mitigated. These persistent risks in the main belonged to the Environment quadrant highlighting the inherent risk in developing software across geographic boundaries. Perhaps these frameworks (and arguably any framework), would have difficulty alleviating, issues that appear to be outside the immediate control of the organization.",

The objective of this paper is, through the application of the Momentum method, to analyze the demand of customers for a company in the field of corporate training in Brazil, considering different contexts and, from this, to propose a decision-making process to the increase efficiency and effectiveness of its procedures, prioritizing T&D courses that present more return and relevance to the organization. For this purpose, we use the Momentum method to prospect scenarios, establishing a relationship between the variables that make up each scenario and the portfolio of courses offered by the company. Besides, we applied the ELECTRE-MOr Multicriteria Decision Support (MDS) method to propose a line of action taken by the company, taking into account the trend scenario. The results obtained were satisfactory, providing support to strategic decision making in the composition of the courses portfolio offered, resulting in a classification of them, presenting those who should be prioritized, maintained or discarded by the companyâs management. It is emphasized that the methodology presented in this work can be applied in other sectors - tactical, operational or strategic - presenting relevance to academia and society.",
