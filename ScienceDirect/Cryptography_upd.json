    "abstract": "Abstract\nQuantum cryptography promises information theoretic security of several cryptographic primitives. Most of the proposed security proofs work in an ideal communication scenario where all messages are correctly delivered after the first attempt. However, real networks are subject to message losses and require retransmissions to cope with them. While the latter is hardly ever a problem in classical cryptography, with quantum communication copy-and-retransmit could be impossible due to the famous no-cloning theorem. In this work, we analyze some quantum cryptoschemes such as public-key encryption, authentication and quantum money, assuming that quantum messages may be lost as they travel through the communication medium. Although all these schemes are theoretically secure, we show that this degree of realism renders some protocols insecure or impractical, while others are completely unaffected. When possible, we provide mitigations such as teleportation or protocol modifications to circumvent these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nVerifiable credentials are a digital analogue of physical credentials. Their authenticity and integrity are protected by means of cryptographic techniques, and they can be presented to verifiers to reveal attributes or even predicates about the attributes included in the credential. One way to preserve privacy during presentation consists in selectively disclosing the attributes in a credential. In this paper we present the most widespread cryptographic mechanisms used to enable selective disclosure of attributes identifying two categories: the ones based on hiding commitments - e.g., mdl ISO/IEC 18013-5 - and the ones based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs - e.g., BBS signatures. We also include a description of the cryptographic primitives used to design such cryptographic mechanisms.\nWe describe the design of the cryptographic mechanisms and compare them by performing an analysis on their standard maturity in terms of standardization, cryptographic agility and quantum safety, then we compare the features that they support with main focus on the unlinkability of presentations, the ability to create predicate proofs and support for threshold credential issuance.\nFinally we perform an experimental evaluation based on the Rust open source implementations that we have considered most relevant. In particular we evaluate the size of credentials and presentations built using different cryptographic mechanisms and the time needed to generate and verify them. We also highlight some trade-offs that must be considered in the instantiation of the cryptographic mechanisms.",

However, in the centralized data processing mode, the establishment of large data center and the efficient, stable, and secure connection of server bandwidth have become key challenges. Moreover, the openness and interconnectivity of the tax system network pose various network security threats, seriously threatening the integrity and security of data. For the above issues, this article proposes a tax system network security protection scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography. This scheme combines hash function and elliptic curve cryptography to achieve user anonymity and secure generation of session keys, effectively ensuring the secure transmission of confidential information. The security and effectiveness of the scheme are verified through informal and formal security analysis based on security proof, BAN logic and AVISPA tool. And a comprehensive evaluation of the scheme is conducted, and the results show that the scheme significantly reduced the costs while providing security features.",

    "abstract": "In an era characterized by digital pervasiveness and rapidly expanding datasets, ensuring the integrity and reliability of information is paramount. As cyber threats evolve in complexity, traditional cryptographic methods face increasingly sophisticated challenges. This article initiates an exploration into these challenges, focusing on key exchanges (encompassing their variety and subtleties), scalability, and the time metrics associated with various cryptographic processes. We propose a novel cryptographic approach underpinned by theoretical frameworks and practical engineering. Central to this approach is a thorough analysis of the interplay between Confidentiality and Integrity, foundational pillars of information security. Our method employs a phased strategy, beginning with a detailed examination of traditional cryptographic processes, including Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges. We also delve into encrypt/decrypt paradigms, signature generation modes, and the hashes used for Message Authentication Codes (MACs). Each process is rigorously evaluated for performance and reliability. To gain a comprehensive understanding, a meticulously designed simulation was conducted, revealing the strengths and potential improvement areas of various techniques. Notably, our cryptographic protocol achieved a confidentiality metric of 9.13 in comprehensive simulation runs, marking a significant advancement over existing methods. Furthermore, with integrity metrics at 9.35, the protocolâs resilience is further affirmed. These metrics, derived from stringent testing, underscore the protocolâs efficacy in enhancing data security.",

    "abstract": "As the extensive use of cloud computing raises questions about the security of any personal data stored there, cryptography is being used more frequently as a security tool to protect data confidentiality and privacy in the cloud environment. A hypervisor is a virtualization software used in cloud hosting to divide and allocate resources on various pieces of hardware. The choice of hypervisor can significantly impact the performance of cryptographic operations in the cloud environment. An important issue that must be carefully examined is that no hypervisor is completely superior in terms of performance; Each hypervisor should be examined to meet specific needs. The main objective of this study is to provide accurate results to compare the performance of Hyper-V and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) while implementing different cryptographic algorithms to guide cloud service providers and end users in choosing the most suitable hypervisor for their cryptographic needs. This study evaluated the efficiency of two hypervisors, Hyper-V and KVM, in implementing six cryptographic algorithms: Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (TripleDES), Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares (CAST-128), BLOWFISH, and TwoFish. The studyâs findings show that KVM outperforms Hyper-V, with 12.2% less Central Processing Unit (CPU) use and 12.95% less time overall for encryption and decryption operations with various file sizes. The studyâs findings emphasize how crucial it is to pick a hypervisor that is appropriate for cryptographic needs in a cloud environment, which could assist both cloud service providers and end users. Future research may focus more on how various hypervisors perform while handling cryptographic workloads.",

To address this, we introduce Enhanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography (EECC), an algorithm that enhances security and efficiency. EECC uses secure elliptic curves, an advanced random number generator, optimized key lengths, and quantum-resistant mechanisms to fortify against quantum threats. Both theoretical analysis and empirical tests show EECC's effectiveness in thwarting attacks and improving encryption and decryption speeds, affirming its value in modern secure communications and data protection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of low-power, low-cost devices that may gather data for many applications. These networks rely heavily on Medium Access Control (MAC) features for administration due to the critical roles of energy and security. Due to the low resources of the nodes, traditional security methods are unsuitable for WSNs, hence lightweight cryptographic algorithms are required to ensure adequate security. Nodes, which are communication devices in WSNs, are used. Data trust, data availability, authentication, and data integrity are just some of the security concerns raised by the deployment of such nodes. To address these concerns and ensure secure data transmission, cryptographic methods should be utilized. Keeping information transmitted over a wireless sensor network secure is complicated by the technology's increasing popularity. The problem arises because of the constraints imposed by finite supplies of energy, data storage, and processing power. This research offers a method for node validations in WSN for secure data transmission, taking into account the characteristics of wireless sensor nodes where the energy consumption for transferring data is substantially larger than that for calculation. Cryptography keys will be used for node authentication and for secure data transmission. Messages sent between nodes in a WSN must be encrypted, and the network must keep a key for encryption and decryption. As a result, Key management plays a crucial role in ensuring WSN safety. Each node will be allocated with a key set which is used for node validation, encryption and decryption. Secure and efficient data transmission in WSN relies on obtaining such a key arrangement in a constrained resource setting. Plaintext assaults, attacks using brute force, attacks via side channels, and computational complexity are just a few of the security problems that plague today's algorithms. This research presents a scheme for protecting sensor data during transmission and after it has been received by nodes. This research proposes a Exceptional Key based Node Validation for Secure Data Transmission using Asymmetric Cryptography (EKbNV-SDT-AC) model. This research performs node validation, encryption and decryption of data in the WSN to securely transmit the data from source to destination. The proposed model when compared with the traditional model performs better in data node validation and secure data transmission.",

    "abstract": "With the recent technological developments, massive vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been established, enabling numerous vehicles and their respective Road Side Unit (RSU) components to communicate with one another. The best way to enhance traffic flow for vehicles and traffic management departments is to share the data they receive. There needs to be more protection for the VANET systems. An effective and safe method of outsourcing is suggested, which reduces computation costs by achieving data security using a homomorphic mapping based on the conjugate operation of matrices. This research proposes a VANET-based data outsourcing system to fix the issues. To keep data outsourcing secure, the suggested model takes cryptography models into account. Fog will keep the generated keys for the purpose of vehicle authentication. For controlling and overseeing the outsourced data while preserving privacy, the suggested approach considers the Trusted Certified Auditor (TCA). Using the secret key, TCA can identify the genuine identity of VANETs when harmful messages are detected. The proposed model develops a TCA-based unique static vehicle labeling system using cryptography (TCA-USVLC) for secure data outsourcing and privacy preservation in VANETs. The proposed model calculates the trust of vehicles in 16 ms for an average of 180 vehicles and achieves 98.6% accuracy for data encryption to provide security. The proposed model achieved 98.5% accuracy in data outsourcing and 98.6% accuracy in privacy preservation in fog-enabled VANETs. Elliptical curve cryptography models can be applied in the future for better encryption and decryption rates with lightweight cryptography operations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCryptographic group actions provide a flexible framework that allows the instantiation of several primitives, ranging from key exchange protocols to PRFs and digital signatures. The security of such constructions is based on the intractability of some computational problems. For example, given the group action\n, the weak unpredictability assumption (Alamati et al. (2020) [1]) requires that, given random\n's in X, no probabilistic polynomial time algorithm can compute, on input\nand y, the set element\n.\nIn this work, we study such assumptions, aided by the definition of group action representations and a new metric, the q-linear dimension, that estimates the âlinearityâ of a group action, or in other words, how much it is far from being linear. We show that under some hypotheses on the group action representation, and if the q-linear dimension is polynomial in the security parameter, then the weak unpredictability and other related assumptions cannot hold. This technique is applied to some actions from cryptography, like the ones arising from the equivalence of linear codes, as a result, we obtain the impossibility of using such actions for the instantiation of certain primitives.\nAs an additional result, some bounds on the q-linear dimension are given for classical groups, such as\n,\nand the cyclic group\nacting on itself.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional computing infrastructures, offering various benefits. However, the adoption of cloud storage poses significant risks to data secrecy and integrity. This article presents an effective mechanism to preserve the secrecy and integrity of data stored on the public cloud by leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and cryptographic primitives. The proposed approach utilizes a Solidity-based smart contract as an auditor for maintaining and verifying the integrity of outsourced data. To preserve data secrecy, symmetric encryption systems are employed to encrypt user data before outsourcing it. An extensive performance analysis is conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. Additionally, a rigorous assessment is conducted to ensure that the developed smart contract is free from vulnerabilities and to measure its associated running costs. The security analysis of the proposed system confirms that our approach can securely maintain the confidentiality and integrity of cloud storage, even in the presence of malicious entities. The proposed mechanism contributes to enhancing data security in cloud computing environments and can be used as a foundation for developing more secure cloud storage systems.",

However, this assumes that the random number sequence (RNS) used in the secret sharing process is completely inaccessible to attackers. In reality, the random number generator could have vulnerabilities or backdoors, allowing attackers to obtain RNS. Thus, we study an extreme scenario where attackers successfully acquire RNS. Our work explores the relationship between VCS security and RNS, revealing intriguing findings when there is complete or partial leakage of secret information. To enhance VCS security, we propose three innovative algorithms designed to prevent attackers from accessing all original secret image information, even when they possess RNS and shares within the forbidden subset.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid proliferation of cloud computing has necessitated advanced security mechanisms to safeguard sensitive data stored in remote servers. However, this paradigm shift has raised several security concerns, particularly safeguarding private information stored on faraway cloud servers. This study proposes a ground-breaking hybrid cryptographic framework for the secure data storage requirements of cloud computing. The framework incorporates time-limited access control, adaptive key management, and two strong encryption methods: RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard - One Time Password (AES-OTP). AES-OTP and RSA provide symmetric and asymmetric encryption levels to improve data confidentiality and integrity. With the introduction of an intelligent framework for key creation, distribution, and rotation through the adaptive key management component, the security of cryptographic operations is gradually increased. Additionally, time-limited access control helps to protect data privacy by imposing rigorous temporal constraints on data access and reducing security flaws. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is confirmed by thorough performance assessments, which show astonishing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values of 99.12%, 98.78%, 98.11%, and 98.56%. This demonstrates its outstanding skills in protecting private information from unauthorized access and guaranteeing its secrecy in cloud storage settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a cryptographic technique on images based on the Sudoku solution. Sudoku is a number puzzle, which needs applying defined protocols and filling the empty boxes with numbers. Given a small size of numbers as input, solving the sudoku puzzle yields an expanded big size of numbers, which can be used as a key for the Encryption/Decryption of images. In this way, the given small size of numbers can be stored as the prime key, which means the key is compact. A prime key clue in the sudoku puzzle always leads to only one solution, which means the key is always stable. This feature is the background for the paper, where the Sudoku puzzle output can be innovatively introduced in image cryptography. Sudoku solution is expanded to any size image using a sequence of expansion techniques that involve filling of the number matrix, Linear X-Y rotational shifting, and reverse shifting based on a standard zig-zag pattern. The crypto key for an image dictates the details of positions, where the image pixels have to be shuffled. Shuffling is made at two levels, namely pixel and sub-pixel (RGB) levels for an image, with the latter having more effective Encryption. The brought-out technique falls under the Image scrambling method with partial diffusion. Performance metrics are impressive and are given by a Histogram deviation of 0.997, a Correlation coefficient of 10â2 and an NPCR of 99.98%. Hence, it is evident that the image cryptography with the sudoku kept in place is more efficient against Plaintext and Differential attacks.",

Malicious parties gaining access, and otherwise tampering with election results, or the votes make this effort counterproductive. To alleviate this, this study examined the introduction of blockchain. The transparent and immutable nature of the blockchain makes this data impossible to alter and allows the election results to be transparent. To further increase the transparency of the system while keeping voters anonymous, a biometric based cryptography was introduced. The biometric was introduced as the source for the private key for each voter while a public was generated to act as the identity of the voter. The biometric trait of each individual is unique and cannot be forged, hence the identity of the voter is secured. The public key available cannot be traced by to the private key, hence, identity of the voter is anonymous. The system showed an encouraging performance after testing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe development of cryptographic protocols goes through two stages, namely, security verification and performance analysis. The verification of the protocolâs security properties could be analytically achieved using threat modelling, or formally using formal methods and model checkers. The performance analysis could be mathematical or simulation-based. However, mathematical modelling is complicated and does not reflect the actual deployment environment of the protocol in the current state of the art. Simulation software provides scalability and can simulate complicated scenarios, however, there are times when it is not possible to use simulations due to a lack of support for new technologies or simulation scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a formal method and analytical model for evaluating the performance of security protocols using applied pi-calculus and Markov Chain processes. It interprets algebraic processes and associates cryptographic operatives with quantitative measures to estimate and evaluate cryptographic costs. With this approach, the protocols are presented as processes using applied pi-calculus, and their security properties are an approximate abstraction of protocol equivalence based on the verification from ProVerif and evaluated using analytical and simulation models for quantitative measures. The interpretation of the quantities is associated with process transitions, rates, and measures as a cost of using cryptographic primitives. This method supports usersâ input in analysing the protocolâs activities and performance. As a proof of concept, we deploy this approach to assess the performance of security protocols designed to protect large-scale, 5G-based Device-to-Device communications. We also conducted a performance evaluation of the protocols based on analytical and network simulator results to compare the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The main manufacturers of electronic devices are offering alternatives for the easy implementation of IoT projects by using low-cost development boards with advanced performance and information security features. The importance of maintaining privacy in data exchange has been considered by these manufacturers have added dedicated cryptographic modules that are compatible with the main cryptographic algorithms. The most significant problem with these modules is that albeit the use of cryptographic algorithms, there are information security weaknesses in hardware implementations to be considered. The purpose of this survey is to theoretically compare the characteristics of the development boards currently used for cryptographic applications in IoT systems. From a rigorous selection, seven of thirty-one possible development boards for IoT were selected and compared under two fundamental requirements: low-cost and cryptographic security mechanism offered. As a consequence of the study performed and the development boards analyzed in this work, it was possible to generate a guide for the selection of secure development boards for IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWSNs are now widely used for information gathering and transmission using WSN. Due to its low cost and simple communication, this type of network is widely used in many applications. Although hierarchical routing protocols may handle a variety of applications, choosing a Cluster Head (CH) and balancing network overload are difficult problems. This recommended strategy provides LEACH Protocol based on Novel Trust Management with Cryptographic RSA algorithm (NTM-LEACH-RSA) to extend the lifetime of network and to consume less energy. Here the proposed methodology includes two aspects for improving Security in WSN. Using the suggested NTM-LEACH technique, cluster formation and cluster head election are carried out in the first phase. Here, the threshold function value, the distance and density between nearby nodes, and the trust value are used to elect the cluster head. Based on the energy domain and the distance domain, the threshold function value is estimated in this case. The RSA cryptography technique is employed in the second phase to protect data transmission and guarantee data integrity. By using simulation tools, the proposed NTM-LEACH-RSA methodology's performance analysis is estimated. In comparison to other algorithms currently in use, it also offers higher performance results.",

The IIoT platforms have experienced a sea change and their progressively difficult and acquiring intricate. As a result, devices within the network manifest part of the trusted network, therefore compromising other devices in the network. In order to, circumvent is a requirement for a simple safety mechanism between devices to derived by applying a Zerotrust principle. In this work a novel method called, Streebog Cryptographic Substitution Permutation Network-based Transfer Fuzzy Learning (SCSPN-TFL) to improve the network access time. First, device security is designed via the policy engine and policy administrator module using the SCSPN model. SCSPN is performed into IIoT to improve the secure data communication between devices. Next, the device block is sent to receiver for performing decryption and obtaining original device information by such policy and studying communication patterns between devices. Next, data security is presented via a policy enforcement module using Transfer Fuzzy Learning. The results show that the proposed method achieves better data confidentially rate as 8 %, minimal network access time as 28 %, a better data integrity rate as 9 % and a reduced false positive rate as 25 %, as compared to existing techniques.",

There are many factors that affect the stability of EEG signals as a biometric for example, using different recording devices, variation in participant emotional states, performing different mental tasks and recording in temporally spaced sessions. Due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, there are still speculations about the stability of using them for generating a unique and repeatable cryptographic key. The challenge that faces all biometric based crypto-systems is to overcome the variation in biometric itself over time and to generate multiple unique keys from the same observation. In this work, we investigate the stability of using EEG signals as a biometric for both personal authentication and cryptographic key generation. The authentication process was tested using three datasets AMIGOS, DEAP, and SEED. Achieving accuracy of\n, and\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n-Quantum computer is no longer a hypothetical idea. It is the world's most important technology and there is a race among countries to get supremacy in quantum technology. It is the technology that will reduce the computing time from years to hours or even minutes. The power of quantum computing will be a great support for the scientific community. However, it raises serious threats to cybersecurity. Theoretically, all the cryptography algorithms are vulnerable to attack. The practical quantum computers, when available with millions of qubits capacity, will be able to break nearly all modern public-key cryptographic systems. Before the quantum computers arrive with sufficient âqubitâ capacity, we must be ready with quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, tools, techniques, and deployment strategies to protect the ICT infrastructure. This paper discusses in detail the global effort for the design, development, and standardization of various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms along with the performance analysis of some of the potential quantum-safe algorithms. Most quantum-safe algorithms need more CPU cycles, higher runtime memory, and a large key size. The objective of the paper is to analyze the feasibility of the various quantum-safe cryptography algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely utilized in a variety of applications. Attackers might interfere with equipment, and eavesdrop on conversations. Attackers can also modify the data which has been communicated or connect unauthorized devices to the network if such devices are deployed in the physical environment. To ensure WSN security, messages exchanged between communicating nodes must be encrypted, and for encryption and decryption, the network must store a key. Consequently, Key management is of significant importance in achieving security in WSN. Obtaining such a key arrangement in a resource-constrained environment is required for secure and energy-efficient data transmission in WSN. Current algorithms have certain security issues, such as vulnerability to plaintext attacks, brute force attacks, side-channel attacks, and computational complexity. Cryptography along with clustering has been found to be a practical and efficient technique to improve the secure and energy-efficient data transmission in WSNs. In this article we have used an asymmetric Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) method for key generation whereas encryption and decryption of data, has been done by a hybrid of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ECC cryptography A novel algorithm has been developed that incorporates both techniques (Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ECC cryptography) along with clustering through standard LEACH protocol for improving energy efficiency, data security, and network lifetime. The proposed algorithm has been able to overcome the issue of key exchange that plagues AES, simpler than ECC and more reliable than AES. More significantly, it is able to encounter a variety of security threats including side-channel attacks. The proposed algorithm is better and has been compared to current techniques with respect to time complexity, encryption time and decryption time to demonstrate its efficacy.",

In most cases, this information is sensitive and can be stolen due to its importance and the lack of security protocols. In this study we propose a timeâinvariant cryptographic key generation mechanism based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We employed Discrete Wavelet Transform and autoencoders to extract the biometric features from the EEG signals. Using these features, we construct a scheme to generate secure seeds that can be used as inputs for secure hash functions and obtain cryptographic keys. The mechanism proposed preserves the privacy of the user, as the cryptographic key is generated for each new EEG signal received, avoiding the need of storing the key, previous EEG signals or any other information. Results show that the proposed mechanism is secure against random attacks, as a 0% of False Acceptance Rate is reported, while generating seeds with an entropy of 0.968 in less than 500 ms.",

The features of the proposed work are (i) computation of only the point multiplication operation of ECC over\nfor a 163-bit key generation, (ii) execution of only the variant of an 80-bit PRESENT block cipher for data encryption & decryption and (iii) execution of point multiplication operation (ECC algorithm) along with the data encryption and decryption (PRESENT algorithm). To establish an area overhead for the flexible design, dedicated hardware architectures of ECC and PRESENT are implemented in the first step, and a sum of their hardware area is computed. Then, the implementation of the proposed flexible architecture for ECC and PRESENT algorithms is presented. Implementation results regarding the area, clock cycles, latency, clock frequency, and power after the place-and-route level on Xilinx Virtex-5, Virtex-6, and Virtex-7 FPGA devices are presented. Hence, the implementation results and comparisons show that the proposed architecture suits applications demanding flexible implementation of cryptographic applications.",

An indispensable condition for the development of smart healthcare is ensuring the security of medical data. The article presents a framework for the implementation of cryptographic proof of smart contracts in healthcare systems. The proposed architecture implements secure procedures for processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) based on an access control array. The cryptographic proof of smart contracts ensures the security of medical data processing and also allows for non-repudiation, enforceability, and accountability of digital agreements made between system actors. We developed an open data exchange format for EHRs stored in the blockchain based on a nested tree structure and the DOM interface. The article presents algorithms for creating, executing and validating smart contracts for processing medical data contained in EHRs. The proposed solutions were subjected to empirical tests and cybersecurity assessment in terms of threat and vulnerability analysis using the risk analysis method. Steps recommended by ENISA and elements of the methodology developed by NIST were used to develop a strategy for minimizing the identified threats and vulnerabilities.",

The free and open interchange of data via networks is essential for the development of communication technologies. As a result, it is essential to ensure the security of transmitted data, especially digital data like readings from smart meters in smart grids. As a result, the study of chaos-based cryptography has received a great deal of interest in the realm of data security. Due to its favourable characteristics, including ergodicity, pseudo-randomness, non-periodicity, and sensitivity to beginning circumstances, chaotic maps have become a popular choice for data encryption. Researchers have concentrated on factors like the highest Lyapunov exponent and sensitivity to beginning circumstances while evaluating these maps. The MATLAB platform has been used to run simulations that produce bifurcation diagrams and calculate Lyapunov exponents in order to analyse and compare various chaotic maps. Further research is required since these experiments have shown considerable improvements in the chaotic behaviour of one-dimensional maps over time. There are two key areas covered by the review. On the basis of their bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponents, it compares newly presented maps in the first place. It then looks at the techniques used to combine one-dimensional chaotic maps. The work shows the potential of chaotic maps for cryptography applications and emphasises the growing significance of data security in the digital age.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of quantum computing, numerous efforts have been made to standardize post-quantum cryptosystems with the intention of (eventually) replacing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Rivets-Shamir-Adelman (RSA). A modified version of the traditional N-Th Degree Truncated Polynomial Ring (NTRU) cryptosystem called NTRU Prime has been developed to reduce the attack surface. In this paper, the Signcryption scheme was proposed, and it is most efficient than others since it reduces the complexity and runs the time of the code execution, and at the same time, provides a better security degree since it ensures the integrity of the sent message, confidentiality of the data, forward secrecy when using refreshed parameters for each session. Unforgeability to prevent the man-in-the-middle attack from being active or passive, and non-repudiation when the sender canât deny the recently sent message. This study aims to create a novel NTRU cryptography algorithm system that takes advantage of the security features of curve fitting operations and the valuable characteristics of chaotic systems. The proposed algorithm combines the (NTRU Prime) and Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) features to improve the security of the NTRU encryption and key generation stages that rely on robust polynomial generation. Based on experimental results and a comparison of the time required for crucial exchange between NTRU-SSS and the original NTRU, this study shows a rise in complexity with a decrease in execution time in the case when compared to the original NTRU. Itâs encouraging to see signs that the suggested changes to the NTRU work to increase accuracy and efficiency.",

To be specific, static analysis is not effective to obfuscated binaries, while dynamic analysis is usually restricted to a certain platform and often takes tens of minutes. In this paper, we propose a block-level monitoring system to detect potentially malicious cryptographic operations. We carry out statistical analysis to find heuristic rules to distinguish between normal and encrypted blocks. In order to apply the heuristic rule to the filesystem without kernel modification, we adopt Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) and define our filesystem Rcryptect for real-time detection of cryptographic function. We demonstrate the protection of well-known ransomware and show that various cryptographic functions can be detected with about 13% overhead.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper delves into the crucial challenge of safeguarding data sensitivity and preventing security breaches, which can result in substantial losses, including significant financial costs and potential loss of lives. Notably, the United States faces the highest financial burden, with data breaches costing approximately USD 5.09 million. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enormous volumes of data are collected from diverse sources. However, the inherent limitations in computational power and memory of IoT devices render them susceptible targets for malicious attacks. This study focuses on fortifying the security of multimedia data, encompassing audio, video, and images, obtained from IoT devices. Cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and quantum cryptography are explored as promising avenues to bolster multimedia security and preserve privacy. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) emerges as an alternative to classical encryption and key distribution methods, offering heightened data security. Simultaneously, blockchain leverages hash functions to augment the overall security posture. By harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics, QKD facilitates secure key exchange between involved parties for data encryption and decryption. Additionally, the paper introduces innovative methodologies to enhance the security, privacy, and anonymity of IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) are becoming more and more capable with each passing day. Widespread usage of WSNs is helping mitigate many dangers. Protecting these networks from risks need proper security measures. This paper offered a security strategy that makes use of IEKC (Improved Elliptic Key Cryptography). Data encryption and decryption are accomplished via IKEC. A major feature of this technique is that node's source codes maintain Private Keys which protect other keys in non-volatile memories. The suggested technique prevents replay, DoS and Sybil attacks. In this node, cluster chiefs are chosen using CSO (Chicken Swarm Optimization) and nodes are organised according to network size. According to the findings of the simulation, this security mechanism effectively counters different attacks with fewer resources, and it also significantly strengthens the network's resistance to node capture. Results from experiments show that the suggested model is effective regarding PDR (packet delivery ratio), end-to-end latency, throughputs, and energy consumptions.",

The decision-making related to choosing an adequate cryptographic algorithm to use is, indeed, an example concern that affects the performance of an implementation. Lightweight or tiny ciphers are considered to be the go-to algorithms when talking about embedded systems and IoT devices. Such ciphers, when properly integrated, are expected to have a minimal effect on the overall device utilization and thus provide effective performance. In this paper, we propose a unified analytical framework for lightweight ciphers as implemented within heterogeneous computing environments. This framework considers a carefully identified set of metrics that can adequately enable the capturing, ranking, and classifying the attained performance. To that end, a designer can make effective evaluations and exact adjustments to an implementation. This framework uses three decision-making approaches, namely the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) II, and Fuzzy TOPSIS. Such approaches take into account both hardware and software metrics when deciding on a suitable cryptographic algorithm to adopt. Validation entails a thorough examination and evaluation of several performance classification schemes. The results confirm that the framework is both valid and effective.\nGraphical abstract\nDownload: Download high-res image (225KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nWireless Network is usually a non-infrastructure multi-hop network, in which the communication between the nodes are carried implicitly or explicitly with the help of intermediate nodes. The two primary considerations when creating a wireless network are energy efficiency and secrecy, which are currently hot topics in study. Power-related issues make the conventional tiered approach ineffective. We suggest a novel solution to address those problems: the Young's double slit experiment optimizer (YDEO) based optimized cross layer routing protocol. This method computes parameters like data success rate, average energy loads, and traffic indices to determine consistency and energy efficacious routing paths. The secrecy of the network can be enhanced with the proposed innovative approach known as Hybrid Elliptic Curve Cryptography and Diffie Hellman Key Exchange (HECC-DH). This greatly enhances data integrity and security by offering dual authentications with key exchange techniques. In addition to this HECC-DH, bilinear maps are used for secure communication. To verify the effectiveness of the suggested work, experiments are performed with the NS2 simulator and contrasted with state-of-the-art works. When it comes to communication, our method performs better than the others and with greater satisfaction.",

Based on regulatory guidelines and security-related standards issued by regulatory agencies around the world including IAEA, NRC, and KINAC, nuclear operating organizations and related systems manufacturing organizations, design companies, and regulatory agencies are considering methods to prepare for nuclear cybersecurity. Cryptographic algorithms have to be developed and applied in order to meet nuclear cybersecurity requirements. This paper presents methodologies for validating cryptographic algorithms that should be continuously applied at the critical control system of I&C in NPPs. Through the proposed schemes, validation programs are developed in the PLC, which is a critical system of a NPPâs I&C, and the validation program is verified through simulation results. Since the development of a cryptographic algorithm validation program for critical digital systems of NPPs has not been carried out, the methodologies proposed in this paper could provide guidelines for Cryptographic Module Validation Modeling for Control Systems in NPPs. In particular, among several CMVP, specific testing techniques for ECB mode-based block ciphers are introduced with program codes and validation models.",

Terrorists often use encrypted messages to communicate with their teammates in different parts of the world, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities. The framework addresses this issue by detecting with gradient boosting algorithm and cryptanalyzing by using Simple Substitution Cipher techniques to decrypt suspicious messages and predict potential criminal activity. The framework utilizes various emerging trends in information technology, including machine learning techniques, pre-defined decision rules, wordnet, and semantic web ontology, to predict the type of crime, the criminal's name and location, and other criminal details. It comprises multiple components, including Semantic web Ontology, Suspicious Database, and machine learning techniques, to facilitate the detection and reporting of criminal activity. When the server receives a suspicious encrypted message, the framework detect and decrypts it and predicts the type of crime based on microblogs before it can be executed by the criminals. The details of the criminals are then alerted to the cybercrime department, reducing the burden on security departments and enhancing public safety. In summary, the framework provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges posed by encrypted messages in criminal activities. It uses advanced technologies to identify and predict potential criminal activities, enabling law enforcement agencies to take preemptive actions to prevent major and minor attacks, including terrorist attacks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCryptography is one of the techniques to secure communication and data transfer over the network. It performs well on resource-rich devices (PC, servers, smartphones, etc.). However, it may not fit or, if forcefully fitted, perform poorly on the resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, sensors). For these reasons, there is a need for a lightweight version of cryptography, called lightweight cryptography (LWC). While designing any cryptography algorithm, a substitution box (S-box) is a core and the only component that offers a nonlinear functionality between inputs and outputs. Various researchers propose various S-box designs for different applications. Still, very few of them maintain the trade-offs among cost, performance and security, especially when considered resource-constrained IoT devices. First, the article discusses various S-boxes used in the popular LWC algorithms by their inputâoutput bit-size (3/4/5/6/8 bit) and highlights their strengths and limitations. Then, it focuses on the proposed 5-bit S-box design. The novel design uses a chaotic mapping theory to offer a random behaviour of the element in the proposed S-box. The experimental results from ASIC implementation reveal two essential characteristics of the proposed S-box, cost and performance, and further, compare it with 4/5-bit S-box competitors. Finally, the article demonstrates the security strength of the proposed 5-bit S-box through various cryptanalysis such as bijective, nonlinearity, linearity, differential cryptanalysis, differential style boomerang attack, avalanche effect, bit independence criterion, etc. Also, a comparison is carried out to exhibit the superiority of the proposed 5-bit S-box over its 5-bit competitors.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the application and promotion of UAV in the future, remote sensing image information is transmitted frequently, and its security issues will not be ignored. Aiming at the privacy security problem of portrait information in remote sensing images, this paper proposes a face privacy protection technology scheme based on chaos and DNA cryptography. Firstly, the edge recognition face detection technology is used to identify the face information, and the corresponding matrix is selected as the object of selective encryption. Then, the hash eigenvalues of the selected encrypted object are extracted, and the plaintext-associated chaotic sequences are generated for RGB permutation and zigzag interleaved scrambling in turn. Then, the three channels of RGB are encrypted by dynamic chain DNA encoding in turn. Finally, the cipher-image is obtained after performing discontinuous diffusion and lightweight bit-level confusion. In this paper, chaotic pseudo-random sequences with plaintext correlation and dynamic DNA chain encryption are used to effectively improve the ability of encryption system to resist cryptographic attacks. At the same time, selective encryption can effectively reduce the encryption complexity and performance overhead. Experimental results and security analysis show that the privacy protection scheme has excellent security and efficiency performance. Therefore, the face privacy protection technology scheme reported in this paper has excellent performance and has broad application prospects in UAV and remote sensing communication.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nRansomware has been established as one of the largest current threats to organisations, small businesses, governments, and individuals alike. The appearance of cryptocurrencies and the enhancement of encryption key management schemes increased the capacity of this malicious software to compromise the victim's data and demand ransom payments. The variety of ransomware families and their continued evolution make the task of detecting and mitigating these attacks extremely difficult. Current ransomware typically uses complex multi-layer hybrid encryption methods, which cannot be mitigated using conventional methods such as attacking the encryption keys directly. Recent studies have shown that when using live forensic techniques, it is possible to find the ransomware data encryption keys in the volatile memory of an infected machine while the ransomware is being executed, in a form of a side-channel attack. However, the related work in the field does not address the most recent cryptography typically now used by ransomware, including stream ciphers such as Salsa20. Related work has also not fully explored the typical use of unique keys per victim's file which is now common with current ransomware. The work described in this paper reproduces these latest cryptographic management techniques being used and explores methods for both, Salsa20 key extraction from memory, and one key per file ransomware encryption key recovery. The methods have been evaluated against recent real-world ransomware samples with various victim file data sets. The method has been shown in some cases to successfully recover over 90% of Salsa20 key and nonce pairs from volatile memory, which in turn have been used to decrypt victim files to validate the extracted pairs. This method could facilitate the recovery of victims' files without the need for paying a ransom and bypasses the complex hybrid encryption methods typically used by current ransomware. The findings from the experiments show that it is possible to use live memory forensics to extract multiple ransomware symmetric encryption keys during execution, and then use these to successfully decrypt a large percentage of the victim's encrypted files without requiring the master key. The developed method could be used to help recover from the most advanced current ransomware attack and can prove useful when developing new cryptographic ransomware mitigation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe ransomware threat has loomed over our digital life since 1989. Criminals use this type of cyber attack to lock or encrypt victims' data, often coercing them to pay exorbitant amounts in ransom. The damage ransomware causes ranges from monetary losses paid for ransom at best to endangering human lives. Cryptographic ransomware, where attackers encrypt the victim's data, stands as the predominant ransomware variant. The primary characteristics of these attacks have remained the same since the first ransomware attack. For this reason, we consider this a key factor differentiating ransomware from other cyber attacks, making it vital in tackling the threat of cryptographic ransomware. This paper proposes a cyber kill chain that describes the modern crypto-ransomware attack. The survey focuses on the Encryption phase as described in our proposed cyber kill chain and its detection techniques. We identify three main methods used in detecting encryption-related activities by ransomware, namely API and System calls, I/O monitoring, and file system activities monitoring. Machine learning (ML) is a tool used in all three identified methodologies, and some of the issues within the ML domain related to this survey are also covered as part of their respective methodologies. The survey of selected proposals is conducted through the prism of those three methodologies, showcasing the importance of detecting ransomware during pre-encryption and encryption activities and the windows of opportunity to do so. We also examine commercial crypto-ransomware protection and detection offerings and show the gap between academic research and commercial applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIoT devices typically encompass objects or devices equipped with software and internet connectivity, allowing them to collect data. They have limited processing power, memory, and storage. These limitations can make it difficult to secure these devices, as traditional security measures may not be practical. Implementing security for IoT devices can be challenging due to these characteristics, but several steps can be taken to mitigate these challenges. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) can secure resource constrained IoT devices by providing a more efficient method of encryption and authentication than traditional methods such as RSA. In this paper, we analyzed the lightweight cryptographic algorithm ECC for securing resource-constrained devices such as IoT and evaluated its performance compared to the RSA cryptosystem. The analysis result indicates that ECC is considered to provide stronger security than RSA for the same key length. The CoAP protocol is applied to devices with limited resources, and an examination of its impact is conducted, considering three key performance metrics: CPU usage, bandwidth efficiency, and message communication latency.",

There are many algorithms designed to protect the cloud server from attacks that have been able to protect the cloud server attacks. Still, the attackers have designed even better mechanisms to break these security algorithms. Cloud cryptography is the best data protection algorithm that exchanges data between authentic users. In this article, one symmetric cryptography algorithm will be designed to secure cloud server data, used to send and receive cloud server data securely. A double encryption algorithm will be implemented to send data in a secure format. First, the XOR function will be applied to plain text, and then salt technique will be used. Finally, a reversing mechanism will be implemented on that data to provide more data security. To decrypt data, the cipher text will be reversed, salt will be removed, and XOR will be implemented. At the end of the paper, the proposed algorithm will be compared with other algorithms, and it will conclude how much better the existing algorithm is than other algorithms.",

The proposed method has a layered architecture with several cohesive components, and corresponded with an NP-hard problem, despite its symmetric structure. This two-step technique is not limited to gray-scale pictures, and furthermore, it is relatively secure from the theoretical dimension.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has taken the interconnected world by storm. Due to their immense applicability, IoT devices are being scaled at exponential proportions worldwide. But, very little focus has been given to securing such devices. As these devices are constrained in numerous aspects, it leaves network designers and administrators with no choice but to deploy them with minimal or no security at all. We have seen distributed denial-of-service attacks being raised using such devices during the infamous Mirai botnet attack in 2016. Therefore we propose a lightweight authentication protocol to provide proper access to such devices. We have considered several aspects while designing our authentication protocol, such as scalability, movement, user registration, device registration, etc. To define the architecture we used a three-layered model consisting of cloud, fog, and edge devices. We have also proposed several pre-existing cipher suites based on post-quantum cryptography for evaluation and usage. We also provide a fail-safe mechanism for a situation where an authenticating server might fail, and the deployed IoT devices can self-organize to keep providing services with no human intervention. We find that our protocol works the fastest when using ring learning with errors. We prove the safety of our authentication protocol using the automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. In conclusion, we propose a safe, hybrid, and fast authentication protocol for authenticating IoT devices in a fog computing environment.",

There were revealed contradictions between the approaches to the development of encryption algorithms for information security systems and encoding algorithms for information protection in computer systems and networks. One of the variants to solve this problem is creation a theory of cryptographic encoding. This work will explain the origins of researching the information encoding processes under the control of cryptographic primitives. The encryption algorithms' synthesis and analysis through the prism of discrete devices synthesis and analysis allow us to consider the cryptographic algorithms' classification issues in a different way, to determine possible directions for developing the new crypto algorithms, and to improve existing crypto algorithms. The correlations between symmetric and asymmetric ciphers are being analyzed. A new approach to the construction of asymmetric stream ciphers is proposed. The methods for increasing the length of the block of information and the length of the key for both new and already known encryption algorithms, as well as options for their implementation, are presented. The given examples of encryption algorithms demonstrate new opportunities for improving the computer cryptography systems and the information security cryptographic systems based on applying the new knowledge being obtained in the process of constructing a cryptographic encoding theory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPhysically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are becoming more widely recognized as tamper-resistant, high-entropy hardware security primitives. Leveraging the intrinsic manufacturing properties of integrated circuits, PUFs provide a lightweight, cost-effective technique for device identification and cryptographic key generation. Despite the existence of various PUF designs and architectures, the ring oscillator (RO) PUF stands out as one of the most notable. This significance is due to its simplicity of implementation and outstanding performance metrics. However, traditional RO-PUFs are often classified as weak PUFs because they support a limited size of input-output combinations. This paper introduces a configurable inversion unit designed to construct a lightweight, robust architecture configurable (RAC) RO-PUF. The proposed unit comprises an XOR gate, an XNOR gate, and a multiplexer. The RACRO-PUF significantly increases the size of generated output bits while efficiently utilizing minimal hardware resources. The performance of the RACRO-PUF stands out in evaluations, recording a uniqueness of 49.78 %, uniformity of 49.42 %, reliability of 97.72 %, and impressive randomness of 98.34 %.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSecure data transmission in wireless mesh networks is a necessary attribute for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Numerous attacks may have an adverse effect on the system's computing efficiency. In order to accurately detect an attack and enable data protection, Whale with Cuckoo search optimization (WCSO) based quantum neural network (QNN) and elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is presented. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to choose the features in the network data that aid in precisely detecting intrusions. To identify attacks, the optimized quantum network which combines the WOA approach with the feed-forward and backpropagation algorithms, is used. Sensitive data retrieving requires an encryption procedure that is enabled by the ECC algorithm, which could safely save the data files in the server, in order to, secure the documentation with security measures. In the event that the data owner maintains sensitive data on a server, the document is encrypted using the encryption method. To determine the best key optimized ECC is used. The QNN with WOA-based IDS framework is a solid option for real-time intrusion detection analysis with high accuracy of 98.5%. Thus, the study has demonstrated that the suggested effort will also provide better secure data storage, resolving security concerns.",

To guarantee everything is secure, cloud security has to handle all the devices, apps, and data connected to the cloud. Because of the cloud's robust security, the data and applications may be accessed by the relevant people. The usage of public cloud security ensures that customers always have a trustworthy method of accessing apps and data, which in turn enables service providers to resolve any potential security problems as soon as they arise. This paper presents a public cloud security technique using Hybrid Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC). The proposed approach makes keys using a lightweight Edwards curve. The user's Identity Based Encryption is used to change the generated private keys. The proposed key reduction method is used to make the keys even shorter, which speeds up the Advanced Encryption standard (AES) encryption process. The public keys are exchanged using Diffie Hellman key exchange. Throughput and key generation, encryption, and decryption times are used to evaluate how well the suggested model performs. The suggested model fared better than the current models in every way. The suggested method's key creation process takes 0.000025 s, while the resulting encryption process takes 0.00349 s. The achieved throughput is 693.10 kB/s.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nImage tamper detection is a challenging area in multimedia research. The advances in photography technology have made it possible to capture real-time high-dynamic-range (HDR) images through an iPhone or an Android device, which highlights the need for rigorous research on HDR images for tamper detection, and localization. The algorithms built for standard images may affect the watermark visibility when it is applied to HDR images as this produces high perceptual variations in the image compared to the original. To tackle this problem, we presented a Proof of Work consensus blockchain watermarking scheme combined with a convolution attention model (PoWBWM) system for tamper detection and localization. The system utilizes a Convolution Attention model (CoAtNet) to generate robust watermarks. A quaternion graph-based transform (QGBT) for embedding, ensuring imperceptibility and robustness. A fuzzy inference system optimizes embedding regions and factors based on human visual system characteristics. The system's security is enhanced through blockchain's proof-of-work (consensus) mechanism, providing a semi-blind watermarking scheme that authenticates ownership and detects tampering efficiently. The security is ensured only when the embedded hash key is authentic with its previous block to proceed further extraction process. The proposed algorithm's performance is evaluated in terms of its visibility by Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and the perceptual quality of an HDR image is additionally measured by the Visual Dynamic Predictor (VDP) metric. On the other hand, the robustness performance is measured by Normalized Correlation Coefficient (NCC) and Bit Error Rate (BER). The experimental results for CASIA images achieved the highest PSNR value of 63.84â¯dB, and the SSIM value of 1.000, whereas the maximum VDP value obtained for HDR images is 98.02. In comparison with the existing system, the experimental findings of the suggested model show an effective tamper detection watermarking system as well as a robust against both intentional and unintentional attacks with an average NCC value of 0.98.",

Existing solutions for privacy-preserving smart contracts either support only a limited class of smart contracts or rely on noncryptographic assumptions.\nWe propose a cryptographic obfuscation scheme for smart contracts based on existing blockchain mechanisms, standard cryptographic assumptions, and witness encryption. In the proposed scheme, an obfuscated smart contract does not reveal its algorithm and hardcoded secrets and preserves encrypted states. Any user can provide it with encrypted inputs and allow an untrusted third party to execute it. Although multiparty computation (MPC) among dynamically changing users is necessary, its privacy is protected if at least one user is honest. If the MPC does not finish within a period of time, anyone can cancel and restart it. The proposed scheme also supports decentralized obfuscation where even the participants of the obfuscation process cannot learn secrets in the obfuscated smart contract unless all of them are malicious. As its applications, we present a new trustless bitcoin bridge mechanism that exposes no secret key and privacy-preserving anti-money laundering built into smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe looming threat of quantum attacks on the digital infrastructure protected by conventional cryptographic protocol has generated urgency in identifying and deploying countermeasures that can mitigate the threat. There is a need for stronger cryptographic schemes that combine the strengths of both classic and quantum technologies. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a potential solution that can withstand the challenges posed by advances in quantum computing. Owing to the increasing importance of PQC, the present research is an attempt to assess the existing research done so far so that the existing gaps can be identified which can then strengthen the existing literature. The systematic literature review presented in this work has outlined six key categories of PQC, namely, lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, multivariate, isogeny-based, symmetric-key-based cryptosystems. The study concluded that the advances made in quantum computing will result in the development of quantum computers with superior computational power. Such highly efficient quantum computers will have the ability to break the currently available cryptography schemes most used in a variety of practical applications. With the advent of quantum computing, the computational capabilities of the potential cyber attackers would grow exponentially, which would render the traditional cyber security measures inadequate. This calls for techniques like PQC to be developed and strengthen.",

Users can access them anywhere, anytime via the Internet without any need to know the infrastructure knowledge, experience, or even authority that provides such services. It has become an important medium for enterprises to develop their networks because of these resources. With the growing need for cloud computing, security is becoming important for both individuals and business needs. Many researchers have studied the security of cloud computing. Still, security gaps or threats are increasing as the demand for cloud computing connectivity increases. Because a third party mostly provides cloud platforms to the cloud client, data protection in the cloud is the primary issue. This paper presents a novel, effective lightweight homomorphic cryptographic algorithm which contains two layers of encryption. The first layer uses the new effective, light-weight cryptographic algorithm and the second layer multiplicative homomorphic schemes considered for improving security data in cloud computing. This approach offers both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography features. The proposed approach's performance is evaluated using a variety of metrics, including memory, computational time and (key sensitivity), statistical analysis, image histogram, and entropy change analysis. The proposed algorithm's experimental findings showed a high level of security and an apparent improvement in encryption execution time, memory usage, and throughput. When compared to the cryptographic systems widely used in cloud computing.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nImplementing hardware primitives into cryptosystem has become a new trend in electronic community. Memristor, with intrinsic stochastic characteristics including the switching voltages, times and energies, as well as the fluctuations of the resistance state over time, could be a naturally good entropy source for cryptographic key generation. In this study, based on kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation, multiple Artificial Intelligence techniques, as well as kernel density map and time constant analysis, memristive spatiotemporal variability within graphene based conductive bridging RAM (CBRAM) have been synergistically analyzed to verify the inherent randomness of the memristive stochasticity. Moreover, the random number based on hardware primitives passed the Hamming Distance calculation with high randomness and uniqueness, and has been integrated into a Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptosystem. The security of the holistic cryptosystem relies both the modular arithmetic algorithm and the intrinsic randomness of the hardware primitive (to be more reliable, the random number could be as large as possible, better larger than 2048 bits as NIST suggested). The spatiotemporal-variability-based random number is highly random, physically unpredictable and machine-learning-attack resilient, improving the robustness of the entire cryptosystem.\nGraphical abstract\nThe intrinsic spatiotemporal variation in a graphene based CBRAM has been utilized as cryptographic key generation. The device to device, cycle to cycle and time to time variation have been comprehensively study based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, machine learning techniques as well as kernel density map analysis. Implementing those hardware primitive into a RSA cryptosystem has been proved as in high robustness.\nDownload: Download full-size image",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBlock symmetric cryptographic algorithms are the essential and inalienable element of any information security system. The main component of block symmetric cryptographic algorithms is the S-box, which largely determines the speed and cryptographic quality of the entire cryptographic transformation. The rapid development of cryptanalysis methods, including the development of quantum computers, requires a more careful research of all possible representations of nonlinear elements of block symmetric cryptographic algorithms. In view of the fact that in addition to the mathematical apparatus of Boolean functions used today to estimate the cryptographic quality of S-boxes, a cryptanalyst can apply the mathematical apparatus of functions of many-valued logic, which makes relevant the task of researching and comparing the cryptographic quality of S-boxes of modern cryptographic algorithms, represented by functions of many-valued logic. This paper presents a research and comparative analysis of nonlinear transformations of the cryptographic algorithms AES, Kalyna, BelT, and Kuznechik when represented by functions of many-valued logic. It was found that only the nonlinear transformation of the BelT cryptographic algorithm is characterized by growth when represented by many-valued logic functions, while the Kalyna cryptographic algorithm demonstrates the greatest decrease in nonlinearity when represented by 16-functions among the cryptographic algorithms researched. The results obtained in the paper indicate a significant unused reserve of cryptographic quality, which can be used in the design of new cryptographic algorithms and their structural elements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of things (IoT) has become more popular due to the development and potential of smart technology aspects. Security concerns against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have grown along with the need for IoT technologies. Enhanced system security protocols are difficult due to the diverse capabilities of IoT devices and the dynamic, ever-changing environment, and simply applying basic security requirements is dangerous. Therefore, this proposed work designs a malware detection and prevention approach for secure data transmission among IoT gadgets. The malware detection approach is designed with the aid of a deep learning approach. The initial process is identifying attack nodes from normal nodes through a trust value using contextual features. After discovering attack nodes, these are considered for predicting different kinds of attacks present in the network, while some preprocessing and feature extraction strategies are applied for effective classification. The Deep LSTM classifier is applied for this malware detection approach. Once completed malware detection, prevention is performed with the help of the Improved Elliptic Curve Cryptography (IECC) algorithm. A hybrid MA-BW optimization is adopted for selecting the optimal key during transmission. Python 3.8 software is used to test the performance of the proposed approach, and several existing techniques are considered to evaluate its performance. The proposed approach obtained 95% of accuracy, 5% of error value and 92% of precision. In addition, the improved ECC algorithm is also compared with some existing algorithm which takes 6.02 s of execution time. Compared to the other methods, the proposed approach provides better security to IoT gadgets during data transmission.",

    "abstract": "Highlights\nâ¢\nWe proposed a novel medical steganography technique with two authentication factors encryption and digital signature.\nâ¢\nWe utilized a secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) to generate a digital signature from the metadata attached to the DICOM file to verify the identity and integrity of medical images.\nâ¢\nThe proposed technique achieves high visual quality and good robustness against steganalysis attackers.\nAbstract\nWith recent advances in technology protecting sensitive healthcare data is challenging. Particularly, one of the most serious issues with medical information security is protecting of medical content, such as the privacy of patients. As medical information becomes more widely available, security measures must be established to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Image steganography was recently proposed as an extra data protection mechanism for medical records. This paper describes a data-hiding approach for DICOM medical pictures. To ensure secrecy, we use Adversarial Neural Cryptography with SHA-256 (ANC-SHA-256) to encrypt and conceal the RGB patient picture within the medical imageâs Region of Non-Interest (RONI). To ensure anonymity, we use ANC-SHA-256 to encrypt the RGB patient image before embedding. We employ a secure hash method with 256bit (SHA-256) to produce a digital signature from the information linked to the DICOM file to validate the authenticity and integrity of medical pictures. Many tests were conducted to assess visual quality using diverse medical datasets, including MRI, CT, X-ray, and ultrasound cover pictures. The LFW dataset was chosen as a patient hidden picture. The proposed method performs well in visual quality measures including the PSNR average of 67.55, the NCC average of 0.9959, the SSIM average of 0.9887, the UQI average of 0.9859, and the APE average of 3.83. It outperforms the most current techniques in these visual quality measures (PSNR, MSE, and SSIM) across six medical assessment categories. Furthermore, the proposed method offers great visual quality while being resilient to physical adjustments, histogram analysis, and other geometrical threats such as cropping, rotation, and scaling. Finally, it is particularly efficient in telemedicine applications with high achieving security with a ratio of 99% during remote transmission of Electronic Patient Records (EPR) over the Internet, which safeguards the patientâs privacy and data integrity.",

    "abstract": "The advancements made in Internet of Things (IoT) is projected to alter the functioning of healthcare industry in addition to increased penetration of different applications. However, data security and private are challenging tasks to accomplish in IoT and necessary measures to be taken to ensure secure operation. With this background, the current paper proposes a novel lightweight cryptography method for enhance the security in IoT. The proposed encryption algorithm is a blend of Cross Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Black Widow Optimization (BWO) algorithm. In the presented encryption technique, CCC operation is utilized to optimize the encryption process of cryptography method. The projected encryption algorithm works in line with encryption and decryption processes. Optimal key selection is performed with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool named BWO algorithm. With the combination of AI technique and CCC operation, optimal security operation is improved in IoT. Using different sets of images collected from databases, the projected technique was validated in MATLAB on the basis of few performance metrics such as encryption time, decryption time, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), CC, Error, encryption time and decryption time. The results were compared with existing methods such as Elliptical Curve cryptography (ECC) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and the supremacy of the projected method is established.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCloud computing provides customers with infrastructure, platform, and software as services through the internet in a cost-effective way based on user demand. Sensitive or confidential information might be stored on the cloud servers and infrastructures that are neither controlled nor maintained by the customers, which might be a potential data breach. Therefore, security is the basic concern that limits the advantages of cloud computing. Cryptography plays a vital role to achieve that level of security required on the cloud. Hybrid cryptography takes the advantage of integrating more than one cryptographic algorithms to enhance the overall security and performance. In our research, we have proposed a comparative study for two-tier versus three-tier hybrid cryptographic models applied to secure data on the cloud. Practical implementation was made to the studied hybrid models using python simulation. Finally, a performance analysis was conducted in terms of encryption time, decryption time, average throughput, and efficiency using relatively larger data files. According to the experimental results, we observed the superiority of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) hybrid model among the other algorithms in terms of performance. Also, we found that the two-tier hybrid cryptographic model is more efficient than the three-tier model, but the latter provides more security. We intend to present a scientific contribution in the field of cloud computing data security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPreserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organizationâs internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.",

Using our method, we build a digital collection exchange system on Ethereum to realize the digital collectionâs online exchange between two museums. Compared with the traditional centralized collection digital resource database method, MAXP can avoid the security risks caused by subjective factors and force majeure factors in the exchange process of digital collections, such as hackers and network viruses. In our exchange system we have built, the expression of content covered by digital collections is more convenient, and copyright disputes can be quickly resolved. Concurrently, given the decentralization and anonymity of the blockchain, a regulatory mechanism has been added to MAXP to avoid fraud, illegal fundraising, money laundering and smuggling. The regulatory mechanism we constructed is a dual receiver public key encryption scheme based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and the SM2 elliptic curve public key encryption algorithm. The sender encrypts the collection data, and both receivers can decrypt the messages using their respective private keys. One of the receivers is the museum that obtained the collection information, and the other receiver is the regulator. These two receivers can decrypt simultaneously, and the regulator can regulate the information exchange on the blockchain. The Beijing Planetarium and the Beijing Museum of Natural History have completed the exchange of collections through the system we have built. The analysis results show that the regulatory scheme based on the exchange blockchain system of the museumâs digital collections proves to be feasible, with security and expansibility. Our new encrypted exchange management method of digital collections in museums can effectively promote the exchange of collections between museums, and is of great significance to the promotion of cultural heritage and the dissemination of scientific knowledge.",

Progressive Visual Cryptography (VC) is considered for the potential over the traditional VC schemes since the former does not require and does not suffer from the limitations of requiring a minimum number of participants during the process of encryption and sharing. The chaotic map-based Progressive VC is superior in facilitating predominant secrecy under sharing and encryption. In this paper, an Improved Henon Chaotic Map-based Progressive Block-based VC (IHCMPBVC) scheme is proposed to prevent the leakage and destruction of sensitive information during an exchange and encryption. This proposed IHCMPBVC technique uses the merits of Henon and Lorentz maps for effective encryption since it introduces the option of deriving non-linear behavior that results in sequence generation that covers the complete range with proper distribution in order to minimize the degree of leaks in sharing. The simulation results of the proposed IHCMPBVC technique investigated using entropy, PSNR, and Mean Square Error were improved at an average rate of 27%, 23%, and 31%, predominant to the baseline VC approaches considered in the comparison.",

Nearly every protocol includes message encryption as a part of its standard. Whether it is https, sh, or S[MIME, the most common types of connections have encryption enabled by default. Most computers can encrypt and decrypt information without any perceivable difference to the user. Processors found in home computers are fairly powerful, but home computers are not the only devices people have. There are an increasing number of smart devices in your average person's home.

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderwater images are being utilised to detect a variety of key resources, such as items, minerals, and rare metals. We can send underwater images across a network since the Internet is so widely accessible. There is a need to send underwater images across underwater acoustic networks securely since they carry crucial information (UAN). To preserve data integrity and confidentiality, UANs need security techniques and algorithms. The security technology currently in use for land-based wireless sensor networks cannot be immediately adapted to UANs due to the differences in communication channels and physical conditions. The cryptographic technique for UANs is faced with several difficulties as a result of these additional characteristics. In this paper we are proposing an encryption algorithm of secure transmission of underwater images over the UANs. This algorithm is based on a confusion-diffusion architecture utilising the 2D Exponential-Cosine transform and DNA Encoding operations. The Security Study demonstrates its high degree of security and its ability to encrypt various colour images into cipher-images that are impossible to decipher.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing need of sensitive or secret data transmission through public network, security demands using cryptography and steganography are becoming a thirsty research area of last few years. These two techniques can be merged and provide better security which is nowadays extremely required. The proposed system provides a novel method of information security using the techniques of audio steganography combined with visual cryptography. In this system, we take a secret image and divide it into several subparts to make more than one incomprehensible sub-images using the method of visual cryptography. Each of the sub-images is then hidden within individual cover audio files using audio steganographic techniques. The cover audios are then sent to the required destinations where reverse steganography schemes are applied to them to get the incomprehensible component images back. At last, all the sub-images are superimposed to get the actual secret image. This method is very secure as it uses a two-step security mechanism to maintain secrecy. The possibility of interception is less in this technique because one must have each piece of correct sub-image to regenerate the actual secret image. Without superimposing every one of the sub-images meaningful secret images cannot be formed. Audio files are composed of densely packed bits. The high density of data in audio makes it hard for a listener to detect the manipulation due to the proposed time-domain audio steganographic method.",

The secret image is converted into two ciphertext images using the VC encryption algorithm, and loaded into two secret vectors respectively. A coherent optical illumination system is built to align the spatial information of the two secret vectors, and decryption is achieved by generating coherent subtraction at the diffraction center of the image plane, the effect is the same as the âXORâ logic operation between two secret images. Both simulation and optical experiments are compared between the optical coherence âXORâ and âORâ operation, and the decryption results demonstrate that the decryption method based on optical coherence âXORâ logic operation outperforms the method based on optical âORâ logic operation in various evaluation indicators such as Structural Similarity (SSIM), Corresponding Coefficient (CC), and Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

It depends on the confusion-diffusion model (permutation-substitution model). Firstly, the plain image is shuffled using the logistic map (confusion). Secondly, chaotic sequences are produced by two-dimensional piecewise smooth nonlinear chaotic map. Then, the produced sequences are preprocessed to integers between 0 and 255. Finally, the shuffled image is masked using the chaotic sequences (diffusion). The suggested algorithm is tested by different types of images. Furthermore, the decryption algorithm is implemented to retrieve the plain (original) image using the secret key. Experimental results and security analyses are applied using the suggested algorithm and its performances are validated with recent cryptographic algorithms. The security and performance analyses conclude that the suggested algorithm is secure, fast, and resists various attacks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nData has been pivotal to all facets of human life in the last decades. In recent years, the massive growth of data as a result of the development of various applications. This data needs to be secured and stored in secure sites. Cloud computing is the technology can be used to store those massive amounts of data. . The rapid development of this technology makes it more critical. Therefore, it has become urgent to secure data from attackers to preserve its integrity, confidentiality, protection, privacy and procedures required for handling it. This paper proposed a New Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithm for Enhancing Data Security that can be used to secure applications on cloud computing. The algorithm is a 16 bytes (128-bit) block cipher and wants 16 bytes (128-bit) key to encrypt the data. It is inspired by feistal and substitution permutation architectural methods to improve the complexity of the encryption. The algorithm achieves Shannon's theory of diffusion and confusion by the involvement of logical operations, such as (XOR, XNOR, shifting, swapping). It also features flexibility in the length of the secret key and the number of turns. The experimental results of the proposed algorithm presented a strong security level and an apparent enhancement in measures of cipher execution time and security forces compared to the cryptographic systems widely used in cloud computing.",

    "abstract": "Due to the need for massive device connectivity, low communication latency, and various customizations in 6G architecture, a distributed cloud deployment approach will be more relevant to the space-air-ground-sea integrated network scenario. However, the openness and heterogeneity of the 6G network cause the problems of network security. To improve the trustworthiness of 6G networks, we propose a trusted computing-based approach for establishing trust relationships in multi-cloud scenarios. The proposed method shows the relationship of trust based on dual-level verification. It separates the trustworthy states of multiple complex cloud units in 6G architecture into the state within and between cloud units. Firstly, SM3 algorithm establishes the chain of trust for the systemâs trusted boot phase. Then, the remote attestation server (RAS) of distributed cloud units verifies the physical servers. Meanwhile, the physical servers use a ring approach to verify the cloud servers. Eventually, the centralized RAS takes one-time authentication to the critical evidence information of distributed cloud unit servers. Simultaneously, the centralized RAS also verifies the evidence of distributed RAS. We establish our proposed approach in a natural OpenStack-based cloud environment. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves higher security with less than a 1% system performance loss.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nPresent electric grids are advanced to integrate smart grids, distributed resources, high-speed sensing and control, and other advanced metering technologies. Cybersecurity is one of the challenges of the smart grid and nuclear plant digital system. It affects the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), for grid data communication and controls the information in real-time. The research article is emphasized solving the nuclear and smart grid hardware security issues with the integration of field programmable gate array (FPGA), and implementing the latest Time Authenticated Cryptographic Identity Transmission (TACIT) cryptographic algorithm in the chip. The cryptographic-based encryption and decryption approach can be used for a smart grid distribution system embedding with FPGA hardware. The chip design is carried in Xilinx ISE 14.7 and synthesized on Virtex-5 FPGA hardware. The state of the art of work is that the algorithm is implemented on FPGA hardware that provides the scalable design with different key sizes, and its integration enhances the grid hardware security and switching. It has been reported by similar state-of-the-art approaches, that the algorithm was limited in software, not implemented in a hardware chip. The main finding of the research work is that the design predicts the utilization of hardware parameters such as slices, LUTs, flip-flops, memory, input/output blocks, and timing information for Virtex-5 FPGA synthesis before the chip fabrication. The information is extracted for 8-bit to 128-bit key and grid data with initial parameters. TACIT security chip supports 400 MHz frequency for 128-bit key. The research work is an effort to provide the solution for the industries working towards embedded hardware security for the smart grid, power plants, and nuclear applications.",

The main aim of the essay is to develop and design a systemic and a secure method for encrypting data, so as it can be used in executing a lossless compacting steganography method. The technique can be used to decrease the amount of every transmitted data aiding fast transmission while using slow internet or take a small space ion a disk. The paper proposes a compacting with stenography method which might be used to hide of data with significant security and also a perfect invisibility while using a combination of RSA (RivestâShamirâAdleman) cryptography method and also used steganography proficiency which are Huffman coding, Run-length encoding (RLE), or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Least Significant Bits (LSB) steganography technique. The first step is grounded on the RSA skill to both decrypts and encrypt confidential messages. The next step is compression, which is Huffman coding based techniques that will be used to compress the sensitive data through lossless technology, RLE, which is a more natural way to compress data or DWT based that compacts cover image through lossy compression in order reducing the cover imageâs dimensions. LSB will then be used to implant the encrypted pieces of information in the compacted cover image. This system shows high ranking performance and a systematic system as compared to other states [1-5] of the structure that uses simulation outcomes.",

Through the design of systems involving collaboration along a value chain, at some point this information is shared between several parties. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the secure exchange of safety information whilst preserving sensitive information for the application of modular Hazard & Operability (HAZOP) studies. We use homomorphic encryption in a workflow for the sharing of information between plant owners and operators as well as module vendors. We apply encryption to the risks from different modular HAZOPs (mHAZOPs), and combine and compare them without disclosing the risk level. Our contribution is a privacy-preserving protocol for mHAZOP comparison during the integration of modular process and equipment. We provide an exemplary implementation of the protocol and demonstrate the protocolâs privacy and correctness.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely used in various security applications to enhance the performances of decision-based models. Malicious data added by an attacker can cause several security and privacy problems in the operation of DL models. The two most common active attacks are poisoning and evasion attacks, which can cause various problems, including wrong prediction and misclassification of decision-based models. Therefore, to design an efficient DL model, it is crucial to mitigate these attacks. In this regard, this study proposes a secure neural network (NN) model that provides data security during model training and testing phases. The main idea is to use cryptographic functions, such as hash function (SHA512) and homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme, to provide authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of data. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by experiments based on accuracy, precision, attack detection rate (ADR), and computational cost. The results show that the proposed model has achieved an accuracy of 98%, a precision of 0.97, and an ADR of 98%, even for a large number of attacks. Hence, the proposed model can be used to detect attacks and mitigate the attacker motives. The results also show that the computational cost of the proposed model does not increase with model complexity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSecurity of data has become a necessity in todayâs world. Data as all know is the raw form and information can be extracted from it. Thus, data needs to be secured. This concern becomes even more significant when share information and it mostly constitute of images. As already know that a picture speaks a thousand words, there is no reason not to believe that picture carry the most information. Furthermore, they can be easily manipulated. This paper presents two schemes to secure such information in the form of images. Under the concept of (k, n) - Visual Cryptography, authors present these two schemes to secretly share images, that can be practically used to secure the information sent. The (3, 3) - enhanced visual cryptographic scheme, enhances security of the currently existing (3, 3) - visual cryptographic scheme by utilizing the concept of keys to secure information. Authors also introduce a new scheme, (2, 3) - visual cryptographic scheme. The (2, 3) - visual cryptographic scheme also utilizes the concepts of keys but reduces the bandwidth requirement or increases reliability. This provides us two modes of operation that are more practical than existing scheme. The paper shall discuss the scheme with a schematic analysis and an analysis of its implementation both subjectively and objectively. Using several parameters of security, this paper presents our findings as our results. The schemes discussed are found to be more secure than existing visual cryptographic scheme and are more reliable and imperceptible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nInternet of things (IoT) is a developing technology with a lot of scope in the future. It can ease various different tasks for us. On one hand, IoT is useful for us, on the other hand, it has many serious security threats, like data breaches, side-channel attacks, and virus and data authentication. Classical cryptographic algorithms, like the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm, work well under the classical computers. But the technology is slowly shifting towards quantum computing, which has immense processing power and is more than enough to break the current cryptographic algorithms easily. So it is required that we have to design quantum cryptographic algorithms to prevent our systems from security breaches even before quantum computers come in the market for commercial uses. IoT will also be one of the disciplines, which needs to be secured to prevent any malicious activities. In this paper, we review the common security threats in IoT and the presently available solutions with their drawbacks. Then quantum cryptography is introduced with some of its variations. And finally, the analysis has been carried out in terms of the pros and cons of implementing quantum cryptography for IoT security.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCryptography has a role to secure an important information. Until now, many varieties of cryptographic algorithms are available in the literature. In this paper, we propose a cryptographic algorithm based on Type IVa max-plus wavelet transforms (MP-Wavelets). Encryption and decryption algorithms are constructed based on the analysis and synthesis process of Type IVa MP-Wavelets, respectively. The encryption key contains the number of channels in all levels. The encryption key is chosen such that multiplication of the number of channels in all levels is greater than or equal to the number of characters in the Plaintext. The decryption key consists of the encryption key and a sequence generated by the binary encoding of detail components. This guarantees that the decryption key is very difficult to obtain using the brute-force method. The cryptographic process involves only maximization and addition operations as main operations. The experiments and analysis show that the algorithm is a good cryptographic algorithm based on the correlation between Plaintext and Ciphertext, encryption quality, the decryption key space, cryptanalysis (Ciphertext-only attack) and security analysis (entropy analysis, key sensitivity, Plaintext sensitivity). This algorithm is also efficient in the running time, because the complexity is linear w.r.t. the number of characters in the Plaintext.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe extensive networking of devices and the large amount of data generated from the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought security issues to the attention of the researcher. Java is the most common platform for embedded applications such as IoT, Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN), Near Field Communications (NFC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The object programming languages such as Java, SWIFT, PHP and C++ use garbage collection after any object run which creates security loophole for attacks such as Next Memory Address Occupation (NMAO), memory replay, Learning Tasks Behaviors (LTB). The security risk increases in IoT when attacks exceeds the target device to the surrounding connected devices. Inappropriate or wrong operations causes energy loss and increased costs. In this paper, a security method to protect IoT system operation from memory heap penetration and address modification attack is proposed. The proposed method prevents directed attack by encrypting the object Garbage Collection at run time. To form a unique signature mechanism, the Cryptographic Hash Function (CHF) which employs a specific one-way hash algorithm. The proposed framework uses L-function based ECC and one-time Key (OTK) to secure the memory heap. Our method is used with open system where the effect on the operating system is not considered. The proposed method proved to be powerful and efficient which can help in achieving higher levels of security across several IoT applications, by enabling better detection of malicious attacks.",

Although many surveys have recently been dedicated to the security and privacy issues of blockchains, there still lacks a systematic examination on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains. To this end, we in this paper conduct a systematic study on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains by comprehensive analysis on top-30 mainstream cryptocurrencies, in terms of the usages, functionalities, and evolutions of these primitives. We hope that it would be helpful for cryptographers who are going to devote themselves to the blockchain research, and the financial engineers/managers who want to evaluate cryptographic solutions for blockchain-based projects.",

    "abstract": "Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) is widely used to provide integrity, secrecy and authentication for the sensitive applications. However, the LWC is vulnerable to various constraints such as high-power consumption, time consumption, and hardware utilization and susceptible to the malicious attackers. In order to overcome this, a lightweight block cipher namely PRESENT architecture is proposed to provide the security against malicious attacks. The True Random Number Generator-Pseudo Random Number Generator (TRNG-PRNG) based key generation is proposed to generate the unpredictable keys, being highly difficult to predict by the hackers. Moreover, the hardware utilization of PRESENT architecture is optimized using the Dual port Read Only Memory (DROM). The proposed PRESENT-TRNG-PRNG architecture supports the 64-bit input with 80-bit of key value. The performance of the PRESENT-TRNG-PRNG architecture is evaluated by means of number of slice registers, flip flops, number of slices Look Up Table (LUT), number of logical elements, slices, bonded input/output block (IOB), frequency, power and delay. The input retrieval performances analyzed in this PRESENT-TRNG-PRNG architecture are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Mean-Square Error (MSE). The PRESENT-TRNG-PRNG architecture is compared with three different existing PRESENT architectures such as PRESENT On-The-Fly (PERSENT-OTF), PRESENT Self-Test Structure (PRESENT-STS) and PRESENT-Round Keys (PRESENT-RK). The operating frequency of the PRESENT-TRNG-PRNG is 612.208 MHz for Virtex 5, which is high as compared to the PRESENT-RK.",

The corresponding ASCII values of the plain text are paired up. The paired values serve as input for the Elliptic curve cryptography. This new technique avoids the costly operation of mapping and the need to share the common lookup table between the sender and the receiver.

Steganography hides the continuation of message by inserting data in some other digital media like image or audio or video format and Cryptography converts data in to cipher text that can be in unreadable format to normal user. For appealing the defence of data thrashing and communication over network, the anticipated system uses cryptographic algorithm along with Steganography. In the anticipated system, the file which we want to make protected is firstly compressed to shrink in size and then the compressed data is transformed into cipher text by using AES cryptographic algorithm and then the encrypted data is concealed in the image. Genetic Algorithm is used for pixel assortment of image where data is to be concealed so that detection of clandestine information become multifarious.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nBiometric-based cryptographic key generation is regarded as a data mining approach that uses knowledge discovery techniques to extract biometric information to generate cryptographic keys for protecting secured data by encryption. This application has been widely used in security systems to limit the weakness of passwords. Although conventional biometrics such as fingerprint, face, voice, and handwriting contain biometric information that is unique and repeatable for each individual, they are difficult to change to be used in different purposes. In this paper, we propose a system to exploit human electroencephalography (EEG) data as a new biometric for cryptographic key generation. This system provides high potential because EEG is impossible to be faked or compromised. Our method is evaluated using the EEG Alcoholism and GrazIIIa datasets, and is shown to reliably produce secure cryptographic keys with a 99% success rate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn today's internet era, with online transactions almost every second and terabytes of data being generated everyday on the internet, securing information is a challenge. Cryptography is an integral part of modern world information security making the virtual world a safer place. Cryptography is a process of making information unintelligible to an unauthorized person. Hence, providing confidentiality to genuine users. There are various cryptographic algorithms that can be used. Ideally, a user needs a cryptographic algorithm which is of low cost and high performance. However, in reality such algorithm which is a one stop solution does not exist. There are several algorithms with a cost performance trade off. For example, a banking application requires utmost security at high cost and a gaming application sending player pattern for analytics does not bother much about security but needs to be fast and cost effective. Thus, amongst the cryptographic algorithms existing, we choose an algorithm which best fits the user requirements. In, this process of choosing cryptographic algorithms, a study of strengths, weakness, cost and performance of each algorithm will provide valuable insights. In our paper, we have implemented and analyzed in detail cost and performance of popularly used cryptographic algorithms DES, 3DES, AES, RSA and blowfish to show an overall performance analysis, unlike only theoretical comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCloud computing facilitates the storage and management of huge volumes of data. It offers flexibility for retrieving the data anytime and anywhere. In recent years, storing data onto the cloud achieved fame among corporations as well as private users. Although, the cloud is drawing a lot of attention still there are data security, privacy, reliability and interoperability concerns that need to be taken care. To deal with these issues, cloud data encryption comes to the rescue. Encrypting the data before uploading it onto the cloud prevents unauthorized users from accessing the data. A lot of encryption algorithms have been developed to secure data stored on the cloud. In this paper, a novel cryptographic technique has been presented that uses client-side data encryption for encrypting the data before uploading it onto the cloud. It is a multifold symmetric-key cryptography technique which is based upon DNA cryptography. Besides presenting the detailed design of our approach, we have compared it with the existing symmetric-key algorithms (DNA, AES, DES and Blowfish). The experimental results illustrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms these traditional algorithms in terms of ciphertext size, encryption time and throughput. Hence, the newly proposed technique is more efficient and offers better performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe appealing feature of quantum key distribution (QKD), from a cryptographic viewpoint, is the ability to prove the information-theoretic security (ITS) of the established keys. As a key establishment primitive, QKD however does not provide a standalone security service in its own: the secret keys established by QKD are in general then used by a subsequent cryptographic applications for which the requirements, the context of use and the security properties can vary. It is therefore important, in the perspective of integrating QKD in security infrastructures, to analyze how QKD can be combined with other cryptographic primitives. The purpose of this survey article, which is mostly centered on European research results, is to contribute to such an analysis. We first review and compare the properties of the existing key establishment techniques, QKD being one of them. We then study more specifically two generic scenarios related to the practical use of QKD in cryptographic infrastructures: 1) using QKD as a key renewal technique for a symmetric cipher over a point-to-point link; 2) using QKD in a network containing many users with the objective of offering any-to-any key establishment service. We discuss the constraints as well as the potential interest of using QKD in these contexts. We finally give an overview of challenges relative to the development of QKD technology that also constitute potential avenues for cryptographic research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nSome quantum cryptographic protocols can be implemented with specially prepared metaphorical chocolate balls representing local hidden variables, others protected by value indefiniteness cannot. This latter feature, which follows from Bellâ and KochenâSpecker type arguments, is only present in systems with three or more mutually exclusive outcomes. Conversely, there exist local hidden variable models based on chocolate ball configurations utilizable for cryptography which cannot be realized by quantum systems. The possibility that quantum cryptography supported by value indefiniteness (contextuality) has practical advantages over more conventional quantum cryptographic protocols remains highly speculative.",

In this paper, a new security algorithm using combination of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic techniques is proposed to provide high security with minimized key maintenance. It guarantees three cryptographic primitives, integrity, confidentiality and authentication. Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are combined to provide encryption. XOR-DUAL RSA algorithm is considered for authentication and Message Digest-5 (MD5) for integrity. The results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm gives better performance in terms of computation time, the size of cipher text, and the energy consumption in WSN. It is also robust against different types of attacks in the case of image encryption.",

Therefore, there is need of better security method with better efficiency in order to increase the security and authenticity and to efficiently decrease computational complexity. Although there are many symmetric key algorithms, we proposed a content-based algorithm, which follows the Symmetric key cryptography method. This is an algorithm implementing binary addition operation, a circular bit shifting operation and folding method and as symmetric key cryptography needs the transmission of the secret key along with the ciphered text through the network, a deep concern has given to make the key secure.",

This cryptographic model is outlined to improve security, sensitivity and robustness for DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications) applications. Using a 280-bit random key makes the model resistant to brute force attacks, which is further strengthened by an intelligent mix of confusion, sorting, substitution and diffusion processes while generating the complex cipher text. Security and performance evaluation is carried out using histogram analysis, correlation analysis, key space analysis, crop test, compression test and differential attacks analysis. Simulation results clearly demonstrate that proposed cryptographic model produces better results compared to existing techniques, with the average NPCR and UACI score for encrypted image to be 99.80% and 34.73% respectively.",

Epilepsy is one of the brain disorders that involves in the EEG signal and hence it may have impact on the system. However, this issue has not been investigated. To solve this problem, we propose a system for cryptographic key generation from EEG signals, and experiment it with the Australian EEG dataset. We used parametric spectrum estimate technique for feature exaction, and devised an error-correction quantization technique that is useful for a noisy data such as EEG. We performed experiments on two groups of subjects, epileptic and non-epileptic to investigate the impact of epilepsy on the success rate of the system. Experimental results show that epilepsy actually has an impact on the performance of the system.",

Security of data transmission is served by the art of encrypted data called cryptography. Biometric cryptography is the emerging methodology in communication networks. Various types of biometrics are available for encryption and also for decryption. This paper introduces a new technique known as brain wave cryptography. Brain waves or signals are generated by the neuron activity of human brain. With the help of sensors brain signals can be captured. After capturing brain waves convert these into digital form. From the brain signals we can generate a secret code or key which can be used as cryptographic key or we can bind key with the help of brain waves. The security of the key can be improved because brain waves will be one of the most powerful biometrics compared to others. This novel approach will enhances the security of the data transmission. This paper also highlights a new idea of automatic ICi selection by taking an average of particular brain regions which resolves the problem of online BCI. The proposed method has been tested in EEG datasets such as .SET, .SMA which succeeds in selecting reference ICi.",

CGA was primarily designed to deter the theft of IPv6 addresses by binding the generated address to a public key to prove address ownership. Even though the CGA technique is highly effective, this method is still subject to several vulnerabilities with respect to security, in addition to certain limitations in its performance. In this study, the authors present an intensive systematic review of the literature to explore the technical specifications of CGA, its challenges, and existing proposals to enhance the protocol. Given that CGA generation is a time-consuming process, this limitation has hampered the application of CGA in mobile environments where nodes have limited energy and storage. Fulfilling Hash2 conditions in CGA is the heaviest and most time-consuming part of SEND. To improve the performance of CGA, we replaced the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA1) with the Message Digest (MD5) hash function. Furthermore, this study also analyzes the possible methods through which a CGA could be attacked. In conducting this analysis, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks were identified as the main method of attack toward the CGA verification process, which compromise and threaten the privacy of CGA. Therefore, we propose some modifications to the CGA standard verification algorithm to mitigate DoS attacks and to make CGA more security conscious.",

The most used communication technologies today is the smartphone, which is a mobile phone with the ability of a portable computer. Currently, to communicate each other, people feel more convenience using chat application in a smartphone than calling or short message services (SMS) features. Some of the advantages of chat application are there is no message size limitations, highest number of consumers use it; especially younger demographics,and it also works on mobile web without application download. Due to the convenience of communication using chat apps increases, the security demands are also higher, i.e., a proper cryptography scheme is needed to protect the messages. In this paper, we implement ECC algorithm to secure text message in messaging application of a smartphone. We will adopt the method proposed by Singh1 to create a chat application in Android program that equipped end-to-end encryption. We also give the experimental result of our chat apps performance such as the accuracy of the received text message, average encryption and decryption time.",

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a well-known access control model which can be used to protect the security of cloud data storage. Although cryptographic RBAC schemes have been developed recently to secure data outsourcing, these schemes assume the existence of a trusted administrator managing all the users and roles, which is not realistic in large-scale systems. In this paper, we introduce a cryptographic administrative model AdC-RBAC for managing and enforcing access policies for cryptographic RBAC schemes. The AdC-RBAC model uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that the administrative tasks are performed only by authorised administrative roles. Then we propose a role-based encryption (RBE) scheme and show how the AdC-RBAC model decentralises the administrative tasks in the RBE scheme thereby making it practical for security policy management in large-scale cloud systems.",

Protecting our data from the unconstitutional processes and keeping the secret information secure and in safe hands, every individual utilizes the cryptography such as symmetric or asymmetric. But, these cryptographic processes needs much more cost for the execution. For that reason, lots of secret sharing schemes were proposed. Secret image distribution is the fine talent and skill concern with the protection of important color images by dividing the secret in multiple copies. The basic fundamental behind the scheme is to change the color image into some multiple unreadable format type shares so that they can not reveal the information inside the image until it is again combines with some mathematical computation. A Secret Sharing Scheme can be estimated by it's the four conditions which are Security, Reconstruction Precision, Computation Complexity, Storage Requirement. In Most of the previous scheme there were issues related with security of image for the reconstruction means user can reveal secret from the hidden image, reconstructed of image quality i.e. contrast or accuracy; it means the reconstructed images were distress from the loss of info related to images and resultant image is different from the original image. Images also suffered from pixel expansion issues for which data loss was occurring. In the present work CMY color model will be implemented with ((n-1), n) secret sharing scheme based on visual cryptography for the color image and compared and proved to be better that the RGB color model which is free from the issue of security, pixel expansion and accuracy issue as well. As the printer use the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black color for printing that's why CMY color model is implemented in this work to prove that CMY color space is better than RGB color space.",

The robustness of a wireless network security requires efficient cryptographic primitives and security protocols able to prove the integrity, authentication and confidentiality of the sensitive information. In this paper, we aim to enhance the data confidentiality and integrity of the wireless network. To highlight the data integrity, we introduce a dynamic integrity check code that calculates a checksum from primitive polynomials generator. In our contribution, we focus on the dynamist, unpredictability and non-traceability of sensitive information. We progress our system by a process of regeneration of the primitive polynomials proper to any communication session without touching the internal behavior of the habitual systems. We aim also to introduce a solution which influences by any minimal perturbation on the sensitive elements. It inspires its robustness by its aptitude to regenerate lightweight, dynamic and robust cryptographic primitives able to ensure robust wireless network security.",

All security properties of the block cipher would be preserved. There are many possible such permutations (e.g. 23116.32 for the Advanced Encryption Standard, AES-256). It might seem infeasible to detect this fraud, and even harder to determine the permutation matrices used. Instead of a block cipher, it could be the compression function of a cryptographic hash, or any other cryptographic function.\nThis paper presents an algorithm whereby this fraud could be easily detected, by means of a SAT-Solverâa standard off-the-shelf software package that solves small-to-medium sized instances of the logical satisfiability problem. This paper also presents how this problem can be modeled in a system of polynomial equations (e.g. in the context of algebraic cryptanalysis). Moreover, this problem is related to the âisomorphism of polynomialsâ problem and that connection is explored at length.",

We use parametric spectrum estimate technique for feature exaction, and devised a error-correction quantization technique that is useful for a noisy data such as EEG. For experimental methodology, we perform on two groups of subjects, epileptic and non-epileptic, alcoholic and non-alcoholic to investigate the impact of brain conditions on the success rate of system.

Using parametric spectral estimation technique for feature extraction, and devised a quantization technique for error correction, a key is generated from EEG data. These techniques are believed to be suitable for a noisy data such as EEG. For experiment implementation, we use the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset. The emotional dimensions used are valence (positive and negative) and arousal (calm and excited) that is divided each in two classes: low and high. For experimental methodology, we performed on two groups of subjects, valence and arousal. Experimental results show that emotion actually has impacts on the performance of the system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nA threshold visual cryptography scheme, denoted as (k, n)-VCS for short, can encrypt a secret image into n share images. The physical stacking of any k share images can reveal the secret content while any less than k share images will leak no information of the secret content. Besides the threshold access structure, general access structure VCSs are studied in the following works. In this paper, we first build a hyper star access structure VCS from a hyper star without center access structure VCS. Then we build a normal form hyper star access structure VCS from a full threshold VCS, and prove that its pixel expansion is optimal. At last, we propose a method of constructing general access structure VCS from its several decomposed normal form hyper star access structure VCSs.",

We point out subtleties in common definitions of probabilistic Turing machines, which imply that the common cryptographic operation of uniform random sampling in a finite set\nis in general not possible within this model.

In image watermarking mechanism mostly LSB substitution is used on the cover image for hiding the secret watermark. In this paper, a novel technique based on the matching of bit pairs and symmetric key cryptography is proposed. Pixel bits of original image and encrypted watermark image are arranged in pairs. The pixel bits are represented in pairs following the proposed algorithm, then the encrypted watermark pixel bit pairs are compared with all bit pairs of original image and accordingly the replacement of bit pairs takes place with the respective matched pair assigned number binary equivalent. If no match is found then go for replacing the 0th pair with watermark bits and replace the two LSB with the value of pair number 0. The proposed mechanism shows good quality of watermarked image along with good PSNR values with a good payload. By comparing the results with some existing algorithms, the proposed scheme shows the valuable results.",

Here, we seek an analogous treatment not of computational processes but of cryptographic protocols and similar, so as to be able to apply the existing arsenal of complexity-theoretic methods in new ways, in the derivation and verification of protocols in a wider, cryptographic context. Accordingly, we advocate a framework in which one may view as resources the costsâwhich may be related to computation, communication, information (including side-channel information) or availability of primitives, for exampleâincurred when executing cryptographic protocols, coin-tossing schemes, etc. The ultimate aim is to formulate as a resource, and be able to analyse complexity-theoretically, the security of these protocols and schemes.",

However, both methods have the same goal, namely the attempt to conceal the message. On the other side, it turns out the use of cryptography can often be solved / translated by another person or cryptanalyst. This is possible because usually a text message unreadable gives someone suspicion that the text message contains a certain meaning for the owner of the message. Thus, the cryptanalyst attempts to break the encrypted message. While the use of steganography owner of the information is difficult to determine the method or pattern to be formed in composing the message that will be hidden. In this paper, the authors modify the Caesar cipher method that produces ciphertext that can be read. With the ciphertext that can be read, then cryptanalysis not suspicious of the ciphertext. Caesar cipher modification is done by replacing the alphabet into two parts, the vocals were replaced with the alphabet vocal too, and the consonant alphabet was replaced with a consonantal alphabet. However, there are some alphabet consonants are not replaced, this is because the frequency of the alphabet is rarely used in an Indonesian text. From the test results obtained ciphertext that can be read. With the ciphertext that can be read, then the cryptanalyst not suspicious of the message so that the cryptanalyst does not attempt to solve the ciphertext.",

We propose a new MAC scheme model using input-output automata to protect the integrity of the secret key in the key exchange protocol. Our scheme was devised in reference to the Diffie-Hellman communication protocol model. We divided our MAC protocol into three stages of communication sequences in order to simplify the model and the design of automata machine. In the final result, we combined all stages and represented the protocol as Cryptographic MAC Protocol in the regular language. We have shown that the cryptographic MAC protocol for key exchange protocol can be implemented using finite input-output automata with some small modification of the finite state machine. The proposed protocol would be useful for implementation ina lightweight or a secure smart devicescommunication in the wireless sensor nodes (WSN) network.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nCryptographic hash functions are used to protect the authenticity of information. Some of the most popular and commonly used cryptographic hash algorithms are MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD. These hash algorithms are used in a wide variety of security applications e.g. securing node/message in traditional networks. However, the commonly used hash algorithms require huge computational overhead which is not affordable by applications in energy-starved network e.g. wireless sensor network (WSN). In these applications the major constraints are communication, computation and storage overheads; out of which communication and computation overheads consume high energy. Keeping this fact in mind, in this paper, a light-weight, one-way, cryptographic hash algorithm is developed with a target to produce a hash-digest with fixed and relatively small length for such an energy-starved wireless network. The primary focus is making the algorithm light-weight so that upon using it in application of network like WSN, the nodes can successfully run the algorithm with low energy. We claim the algorithm fulfils all the basic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance of a one-way unkeyed hash function. Finally the comparative usability of the hash algorithm in the said application domain is worked out and that shows the dominance of our scheme over two of the state-of-the-art hashing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe hidden weighted bit function (HWBF), introduced by R. Bryant in IEEE Trans. Comp. 40 and revisited by D. Knuth in Vol. 4 of The Art of Computer Programming, is a function that seems to be the simplest one with exponential Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) size. This property is interesting from a cryptographic viewpoint since BDD-based attacks are receiving more attention in the cryptographic community. But, to be usable in stream ciphers, the functions must also satisfy all the other main criteria. In this paper, we investigate the cryptographic properties of the HWBF and prove that it is balanced, with optimum algebraic degree and satisfies the strict avalanche criterion. We calculate its exact nonlinearity and give a lower bound on its algebraic immunity. Moreover, we investigate its normality and its resistance against fast algebraic attacks. The HWBF is simple, can be implemented efficiently, has a high BDD size and rather good cryptographic properties, if we take into account that its number of variables can be much larger than for other functions with the same implementation efficiency. Therefore, the HWBF is a good candidate for being used in real ciphers. Indeed, contrary to the case of symmetric functions, which allow such fast implementation but also offer to the attacker some specific possibilities due to their symmetry, its structure is not suspected to be related to such dedicated attacks.",

Visual cryptography (VC) is a modern cryptographic technique which is used to the secret image is shared securely and also its information is maintained with utmost confidentiality. A sender transmits the secret image which is divided into shares and it holds hidden information. When all of these shares are aligned and stacked together, they tend to expose the secret image information to the receiver. Earlier VC scheme, the secrecy of the share is not maintained due to any other fake shares can easily insert or modified remain to be continuing challenges. To solve this security issues, a secure share creation scheme constructed by a (2, 2) XOR based VC scheme is proposed. Once the shares are created, it is encrypted separately by using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. In this process, shares and AES algorithm bind together to give the resultant shares are called the encapsulated shares. Consequently, the secret image information cannot be retrieved from any one transparency via human visual perception. The Proposed scheme offers better security for shares and also reduces the fraudulent shares of the secret image. Further, the experimental results and analyses have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can effectively encrypt the image with the fast execution speed and minimized PSNR value.",

Sometimes sensitive information is communicated via insecure medium so various attacks like Brute force, Crypt analytic are possible for recovering message and key. In recent years, encryption technology has been developed very quickly to secure the transmitted information. Existing techniques have separate mechanism for key distribution and for encryption and decryption at source and destination. As per our best knowledge there is no algorithm that is implemented till now that generates the key and then encrypts the message with that key then transfers the message and the key securely so that the same key can be used for decrypting the message. Still the cipher text remains that of original message length. In this paper we have proposed an efficient cryptographic scheme for text message protection against Brute force and Cryptanalytic attacks. This technique can also be used for most crucial applications where it requires a significant security of transmitted message and also there is no overhead on the transfer of message and the key when it is used with our proposed technique.",

In this work, integrity verification methods for digital verses of the Holy Quran are proposed. The first method uses cryptographic hash functions and generate the hash table of the Holy Quran. SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hash functions are chosen in this work. The second method is a single compression technique which manipulates data during the run time. The compression method makes use of the two bytes in Unicode UTF-8 for the Arabic characters set. The results show that for a digital copy of the Holy Quran encoded in Unicode UTF-8, the sizes of the hash tables generated by SHA256 and RIPEMD160 are 84.73% and 90.46% (6.55-fold and 10.48-fold) smaller respectively. The compressed version of the Holy Quran has a size of 47.24% (1.9-fold) smaller than the original copy. In addition, a second preimage attack on a hash table for the digital Holy Quran produced by using CRC32 hash function is conducted to study the impact of such attacks on the two hash tables proposed in this work.",

Without fault detection, in the context of encryption as well as decryption process can create the unprotected system due to random faults, and vulnerable to attack. We are striving to overcome these system weaknesses by introducing the application of nonlinear fault detection codes as it allows safeguarding the elliptic curve point while adding and doubling the operations from the fault attacks. The use of these codes ensures almost perfect error discovery capacity with a reasonably priced upfront cost. The ECC cryptosystem offered a failsafe fault detection scheme using an error detecting code with a proven rate of 99% fault detection coverage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nA normal certificateless cryptosystem can only achieve KGC trust level 2 according to the trust hierarchy defined by Girault. Although in the seminal paper introducing certificateless cryptography, Al-Riyami and Paterson introduced a binding technique to lift the KGC trust level of their certificateless schemes to level 3, many subsequent work on certificateless cryptography just focused on the constructions of normal certificateless schemes, and a formal study on the general applicability of the binding technique to these existing schemes is still missing. In this paper, to address the KGC trust level issue, we introduce the notion of Key Dependent Certificateless Cryptography (KD-CLC). Compared with conventional certificateless cryptography, KD-CLC can achieve stronger security, and more importantly, KGC trust level 3. We then study generic techniques for transforming conventional CLC to KD-CLC. We start with the binding technique by Al-Riyami and Paterson, and show that there are some technical difficulties in proving that the binding technique is generally applicable. However, we show that a slightly modified version of the binding technique indeed can be proved to work under the random oracle assumption. Finally, we show how to perform the transformation using a standard cryptographic primitive instead of a random oracle.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nUltra-low power has emerged as a principal theme in today's electronics industry. The need for low power has caused a major paradigm shift where power dissipation has become as important consideration as performance and area. The sub-threshold region has made this logic an excellent choice, because power consumption is much lower due to the exponential decay of the active drain current.\nAlong with low power consumption, security is another compelling requirement for some applications. Power analysis attack is a serious threat to devices with secret information inside. Under power analysis attack, attacker observes transmitted power of transmitter and can hack the secret information of the system. This paper presents the design and implementation of secure system under subthreshold condition, so that secure system is well cure from power analysis attack. Here in this paper we presented designing and implementation of finite field multiplier for cryptography applications.\nFinite field multiplier is the key component for implementing cryptographic operation. By developing standard subthreshold cell libraries of 6 elements, 4 bit digit-level finite field multiplier is implemented to operate in the subthreshold region. The power consumption of the subthreshold multiplier is 38nW, the speed of the multiplier is 250 KHz and energy per operation 0.6pJ at supply voltage 0.2 V is calculated. All circuits are simulated using Tanner EDA tool at 70 nm technology node.",

Our proposed data publishing system combine the cryptography with data publishing for the first time. It adopts format-preserving encryption to make sure the ciphertext has the same format with the plaintext.\nâ¢\nCompared with the traditional data publishing methods, our system achieves the goal of data integrity without removing sensitive attributes, and it will not influence the data utility at all.\nâ¢\nOur system can meet the following data publishing requirements: (1) Keep all the structures and referential integrity. (2) Preserve original format of data. (3) Can be widely used to publish text data, relational database, and NOSQL database.\nAbstract\nThe traditional data publishing methods will remove the sensitive attributes and generate the abundant records to achieve the goal of privacy protection. In the big data environment, the requirement of utilizing data (e.g., data mining) become more and more various, which is beyond the scope of the traditional method. This paper provides a cryptographic data publishing system that preserves the data integrity (i.e., the original data structure is preserved) and achieves anonymity without deletion of any attribute or utilization of redundancy. The security analysis shows that our system is secure under our proposed security model.",

One of the methods of creating privacy and securing of information is using Public key cryptography system. In this paper, we compare two algorithms, Common And Fast Exponentiation algorithms, for enhancing the efficiency of public key cryptography. We express that a designed system by Fast Exponentiation Algorithm has high speed and performance but low power consumption and space occupied compared with Common Exponentiation algorithm. Although designed systems by Common Exponentiation algorithm have slower speed and lower performance, designing by this algorithm has less complexity, and easier designing compared with Fast Exponentiation algorithm. In this paper, we will try to examine and compare two different methods of exponentiation, also observe performance Impact of these two approaches in the form of hardware with VHDL language on FPGA.",

Perfect nonlinear (PN) and almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, which have the optimal properties for offering resistance against differential cryptanalysis, have since then been an object of intensive study by many mathematicians. In this paper, we survey some of the theoretical results obtained on these functions in the last 25 years. We recall how the links with other mathematical concepts have accelerated the search on PN and APN functions. To illustrate the use of PN and APN functions in practice, we discuss examples of ciphers and their resistance to differential attacks. In particular, we recall that in cryptographic applications suboptimal functions are often used.",

We present a novel and practical solution and its prototype called DataGuard to protect the secrecy of the highly sensitive data through the storage isolation and secure tunneling enabled by a mobile handheld device. DataGuard can be deployed for the key protection of individuals or organizations.
