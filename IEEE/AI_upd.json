    "abstract": "Contributions: To address the interpretability issues in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered classroom discourse models, we employ explainable AI methods to unpack classroom discourse analysis from deep learning-based models and evaluate the effects of model explanations on STEM teachers. Background: Deep learning techniques have been used to automatically analyze classroom dialogue to provide feedback for teachers. However, these complex models operate as black boxes, lacking clear explanations of the analysis, which may lead teachers, particularly those lacking AI knowledge, to distrust the models and hinder their teaching practice. Therefore, it is crucial to address the interpretability issue in AI-powered classroom discourse models. Research Questions: How to explain deep learning-based classroom discourse models using explainable AI methods? What is the effect of these explanations on teachersâ trust in and technology acceptance of the models? How do teachers perceive the explanations of deep learning-based classroom discourse models? Method: Two explainable AI methods were employed to interpret deep learning-based models that analyzed teacher and student talk moves. A pilot study was conducted, involving seven STEM teachers interested in learning talk moves and receiving classroom discourse analysis. The study assessed changes in teachersâ trust and technology acceptance before and after receiving model explanations. Teachersâ perceptions of the model explanations were investigated. Findings: The AI-powered classroom discourse models were effectively explained using explainable AI methods. The model explanations enhanced teachersâ trust and technology acceptance of the classroom discourse models. The seven STEM teachers expressed satisfaction with the explanations and provided their perception of model explanations.",

    "abstract": "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation necessitates efficient data conversion, traditionally characterized by labor-intensive tasks like validation checks, field mapping, and transformations. While effective, these methods are time-consuming and costly. With the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), data conversion has been revolutionized, significantly reducing manual intervention. Traditional methods, often labor-intensive and costly, are replaced by automated Gen AI solutions. This innovation not only reduces technical effort and business involvement but also accelerates project timelines and lowers costs. This paper explores the implementation of a Gen AI-driven solution that automates data extraction, validation, and mapping, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Utilizing advanced technologies such as SQL, Python pandas, and PyTorch, this approach reimagines the workflow, enabling faster and more reliable ERP implementations with minimal disruption. By harnessing the power of machine learning and neural networks, the system evolves continuously, offering a scalable and robust solution for modern enterprises navigating the complexities of digital transformation. The adoption of Gen AI in data conversion thus represents a pivotal advancement, enabling faster, more reliable ERP implementations and fostering greater operational resilience and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "In our modern era, it has become essential for citizens to possess artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to navigate an AI-driven society. However, there is a current deficiency in studentsâ AI literacy. In response to this challenge, this article introduced the AI STEM Project Design Framework (AI-STEM PDF) designed specifically for teaching AI in middle schools. The framework, created in adherence to Activity Theory and the principles of STEM environment design, consists of five layers: subject-object analysis layer, project design layer, learning tool layer, project rules layer, and project goals layer. Following the development of the AI-STEM PDF, AI-STEM projects were devised, and a pre-post experimental design study was conducted with 64 middle school students across two schools. The results revealed significant improvements in studentsâ AI literacy, thus affirming the value of the AI-STEM framework. Ultimately, the AI-STEM PDF has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of AI courses by providing valuable guidance for their instruction, thereby fostering the development of middle school studentsâ AI literacy.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GAI) is one of the significant components that can efficiently improve and augment the AI cycle modelâs robustness when it comes to different threats, weaknesses, and abnormalities detection. When applied in this field, GAI is very useful in emulating the various forms of security violations in actual adversarial settings. These scenarios are important when different aspects of an AI system are tested on how robust they are and thus permit the developers to amend any vulnerability that may be induced before the time it could be utilized in practice. Data and model manipulation, data theft, and adversarial attacks as well as model inference threats which we do a systematic analysis to disrupt the integrity, confidentiality as well as availability of AI models. Considering the current weaknesses and threats related to GAI we provide a systematic approach to how safety concerns that are currently relevant can be integrated with every stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle management: from continuous monitoring to the application of cybersecurity trends and practices, etc. In our approach, the emphasis is placed on the multi-level security management strategy that incorporates the improvement of coding practices, validation and testing, and the implementation of advanced intrusion detection systems. Before proceeding to further analysis and discussion of the given topic, it is also critical to mention the aspect of regulation and ethical concern as the major drivers of GAI usage. Additionally, organizations can involve GAI in the lifecycle to address security needs, during the development, acquisition, deployment, updating, maintenance, and decommissioning of the AI system, making them reliable, safe, and secure all through their lifecycle. Toward these ends, the goal of this work is to present a set of canonical recommendations for the many scientists, engineers, managers, technologists, and policymakers who will play a key role in constructing ...",

    "abstract": "The common-sense reasoning abilities and vast general knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) make them a natural fit for interpreting user requests in a smart home assistant context. LLMs, however, lack specific knowledge about the user and their home, which limits their potential impact. SAGE (Smart Home Agent with Grounded Execution), overcomes these and other limitations by using a scheme in which a user request triggers an LLM-controlled sequence of discrete actions. These actions can be used to retrieve information, interact with the user, or manipulate device states. SAGE controls this process through a dynamically constructed tree of LLM prompts, which help it decide which action to take next, whether an action was successful, and when to terminate the process. The SAGE action set augments an LLMâs capabilities to support some of the most critical requirements for a smart home assistant. These include: flexible and scalable user preference management (âIs my team playing tonight?â), access to any smart deviceâs full functionality without device-specific code via API reading (âTurn down the screen brightness on my dryerâ), persistent device state monitoring (âRemind me to throw out the milk when I open the fridgeâ), natural device references using only a photo of the room (âTurn on the lamp on the dresserâ), and more. We introduce a benchmark of 50 new and challenging smart home tasks where SAGE achieves a 76% success rate, significantly outperforming existing LLM-enabled baselines (30% success rate).",

    "abstract": "Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have spawned numerous AI companies. Yet, AIs role in facilitating corporate innovation and competence remains understudied. Based on innovation theories, the resource-based view, and the organizational change theory, we develop a holistic framework that integrates organizational AI resources, AI innovation capability, and corporate performance to depict how AI empowers corporate innovation and competence. We propose that corporate AI resources, consisting of data, human, and strategic resources, enhance their corporate performance by improving their AI innovation capability. Furthermore, we propose that a greater extent of humanâmachine collaboration, the ability of humans to utilize algorithms, and computational power effectively in various contexts improves corporate performance. Finally, we outline the key topics for future research, suggesting areas where further investigation could yield valuable insights into AIs role in corporate innovation. Our article offers actionable insights into companies' AI resource allocation and new capability building for competing in the AI era. Firms should prioritize a balanced approach to manage their AI data resources, human resources, strategic resources, and humanâmachine collaboration to effectively enhance AI innovation capability and improve corporate performance. Our article answers how AI resources could empower corporate competence and contribute to AI innovation, organizational change theory, and resource-based view.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been extensive research on AI accelerators to meet the demand for data-intensive analytics. Recently, low-power AI accelerators have been also developed to support battery-operated edge devices and minimize power consumption. However, traditional test architectures are insufficient for effectively testing such low-power AI accelerators. To address this issue, a robust test architecture for low-power AI accelerators has been proposed in this paper. The proposed test architecture employs a simple clock-gating technique in systolic array-based low-power AI accelerators and conducts testing through their functional paths. Accordingly, it can achieve 100 test coverage for both stuck-at and transition-delay faults with a minimal number of test patterns. Additionally, the proposed test architecture requires negligible area overhead since only one AND gate is implemented for the entire systolic array in low-power AI accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Rate-splitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and non-convexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.",

This article presents findings from a survey of Irish SMEs (small and medium enterprises) conducted with the Industry Research Development Group (IRDG). Despite AI's potential, the study reveals low AI implementation across 13 NPD applications, but more positive intentions to adopt AI in the near future. Performance improvements from AI are modest, with an average of 27% improvement across five key metrics. Readiness to adopt AI for NPD, however, is weak with SMEs exhibiting low trust, limited senior management commitment, and minimal demonstrated value from AI. The article concludes with five managerial recommendations, emphasizing the urgency for SMEs to leverage AI to boost innovation, and provides a simple process map for AI deployment.",

    "abstract": "Go is a popular strategy game today, but due to its large search space and task complexity, ensuring stable AI implementation is challenging. Specifically, Go AI training requires setting a fixed optimal learning rate and schedule, which demands significant TPU and GPU resources. To facilitate Go-AI learning, this research explores adaptive adjustment and optimization techniques for dynamic reinforcement learning neural networks. First, we introduce a dynamic batch size technique that adjusts data volume at each training phase and incorporates dynamic network structure search, considering the number of network layers and residual blocks. Second, we propose a dynamic network topology that automatically modifies the learning rate based on the training batch size at various training phases. Our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of stability and model convergence speed. In 100 games, the Go-AI model achieved a 100% victory rate below the 7th rank and a 98% win rate at the 9th rank and higher.",

    "abstract": "Edge AI-based reinforcement learning is less reliant on mathematical models and relies on experience to help with the design and optimization of Consumer Technology models, making it ideal for learning dynamic treatment techniques. However, the current research still has the following problems: 1. The optimality of the learned strategy is considered without taking risks into account, leading to strategies with certain risks. 2. The issue of distribution shift is ignored, resulting in learned strategies that are completely different from those of doctors. 3. The patientâs historical observational data and treatments are ignored, making it difficult to accurately assess the patientâs state, which in turn leads to the inability to learn the optimal strategy. Based on this, we propose the DOSAC-DTR dynamic treatment strategy model, which integrates Dead-ends and offline monitoring into the Actor-Critic framework. First, we consider the risk of treatment actions recommended by the learned strategy and incorporate the concept of Dead-ends into the Actor-Critic framework. Second, to mitigate the distribution shift problem, we integrate physician monitoring into the Actor-Critic framework. This approach achieves better performance, resulting in lower estimated mortality rates and higher Jaccard index scores.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic infecting 224 million people and has caused 4.6 million deaths. Nearly 80 Artificial Intelligence (AI) articles have been published on COVID-19 diagnosis. The first systematic review on the Deep Learning (DL)-based paradigm for COVID-19 diagnosis was recently published by Suri et al. [IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2021]. The above study used AtheroPointâs âAP(ai)Bias 1.0â using 10 AI attributes in the DL framework. The proposed study uses âAP(ai)Bias 2.0â as part of the three quantitative paradigms for Risk-of-Bias quantification by using the best 40 dedicated Hybrid DL (HDL) studies and utilizing 39 AI attributes. In the first method, the radial-bias map (RBM) was computed for each AI study, followed by the computation of bias value. In the second method, the regional-bias area (RBA) was computed by the area difference between the best and the worst AI performing attributes. In the third method, ranking-bias score (RBS) was computed, where AI-based cumulative scores were computed for all the 40 studies. These studies were ranked, and the cutoff was determined, categorizing the HDL studies into three bins: low, moderate, and high. Using the Venn diagram, these three quantitative methods were benchmarked against the two qualitative non-randomized-based AI trial methods (ROBINS-I and PROBAST). Using the analytically derived moderate-high and low-moderate cutoff of 2.9 and 3.6, respectively, we observed 40%, 27.5%, 17.5%, 10%, and 20% of studies were low-biased for RBM, RBA, RBS, ROBINS-I, and PROBAST, respectively. We present an eight-point recommendation for AP(ai)Bias 2.0 minimization.",

    "abstract": "Despite the transformative potential of Generative AI systems within enterprise digital platforms, there still exist gaps in understanding the challenges and strategies associated with their adoption. Addressing this pressing issue, this study draws upon institutional theory to delve into the drivers influencing firms' adoption of Generative AI within their enterprise digital platforms. Leveraging survey data collected from 328 firms that have implemented digital platforms to support their business operations, we find that institutional pressures positively influence Generative AI adoption within their enterprise digital platforms. Furthermore, we identify salient moderating effects of policy uncertainty and innovative culture in shaping the relationships. Our research findings make a substantial contribution to AI literature by illuminating the potential challenges and strategies towards Generative AI adoption as well as reassessing the application of institutional theory within the digital landscape.",

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into innovation management has expanded into creative domains such as Design Thinking (DT), yet its role within complex, collaborative innovation frameworks remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how professionals perceive and utilize AI in DT workshops. Using affordance theory as a conceptual lens, we conducted observational studies and semi-structured interviews with DT experts to identify AI's action potentials, constraints, and mitigation strategies in this context. Our findings highlight four key affordances of AI in DT workshops: enhanced creativity, support for analytical tasks, facilitation of task initiation, and acceleration of processes. However, these benefits are tempered by challenges, including reduced team collaboration, diminished ownership of AI-generated outputs, and disruptions to workshop flow. The study reveals distinct human-AI interaction archetypes, underscoring the dynamic interplay between human expertise and AI capabilities. To mitigate constraints, we propose strategies such as pre-preparing AI-generated content, defining clear roles for AI and human inputs, and fostering collaborative reflection on AI outputs. By illuminating AI's potential and limitations within DT, this research contributes to the innovation management literature and offers actionable insights for practitioners seeking to integrate AI into hybrid innovation processes.",

    "abstract": "The recent o-ran specifications promote the evolution of ranran architecture by function disaggregation, adoption of open interfaces, and instantiation of a hierarchical closed-loop control architecture managed by ric entities. This paves the road to novel data-driven network management approaches based on programmable logic. Aided by ai and ml, novel solutions targeting traditionally unsolved ran management issues can be devised. Nevertheless, the adoption of such smart and autonomous systems is limited by the current inability of human operators to understand the decision process of such ai/ml solutions, affecting their trust in such novel tools. xai aims at solving this issue, enabling human users to better understand and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent schemes, reducing the human-to-machine barrier. In this survey, we provide a summary of the xai methods and metrics before studying their deployment over the o-ran Alliance ran architecture along with its main building blocks. We then present various use-cases and discuss the automation of xai pipelines for o-ran as well as the underlying security aspects. We also review some projects/standards that tackle this area. Finally, we identify different challenges and research directions that may arise from the heavy adoption of ai/ml decision entities in this context, focusing on how xai can help to interpret, understand, and improve trust in o-ran operational networks.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought new algorithms providing high performance compared to the usual methods. However, the internal behavior of the decision-making process carried out by Neural Networks requires to be finely understood. This questioning has led to the development of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This is especially true in areas where following AI decisions may have serious consequences, such as underwater mine hunting to increase the AI acceptance. We study the application of XAI methods (backpropagation and perturbation) to the classification (mine vs non-mine) and identification (type of mines) of an object detected by a sonar on the seabed. Although the aim of XAI is to locate relevant features in an image, the classification or identification decisions do not involve the same cognitive process. The main aims of our paper were to verify that the XAI methods, designed for optical images, can be applied to grayscale sonar images (in particular, we explain why backpropagation methods are not suitable for grayscale images, unlike perturbation methods) and whether they are neural network-dependent (two kinds of network have been tested). The features highlighted by XAI methods for the different classes of mines are compared with each other, but also with those involved in the operator decision-making. Three examples of feature extraction are finally discussed in the case of misclassification. Furthermore, the perturbation approach provides the same highlighted areas for both networks, and these areas on which the Neural Networks base their classification can be linked to the explanations given by operators.",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic computing (NeSy), which pursues the integration of the symbolic and statistical paradigms of cognition, has been an active research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for many years. As NeSy shows promise of reconciling the advantages of reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation and robust learning in neural networks, it may serve as a catalyst for the next generation of AI. In the present paper, we provide a systematic overview of the recent developments and important contributions of NeSy research. Firstly, we introduce study history of this area, covering early work and foundations. We further discuss background concepts and identify key driving factors behind the development of NeSy. Afterward, we categorize recent landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge representation, knowledge embedding, and functionality. Next, we briefly discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several domains. Then, we benchmark several NeSy methods on three representative application tasks. Finally, we identify the open problems together with potential future research directions. This survey is expected to help new researchers enter this rapidly evolving field and accelerate the progress towards data-and knowledge-driven AI.",

    "abstract": "Managing the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a complex task because of its involvement in coordinating diverse activities, stakeholders, and resources while ensuring project goals are met efficiently. The complex nature of the SDLC process leaves plenty of scope for human error, which impacts the overall business cost. This paper introduces AI-Analyst, an AI-assisted framework developed using the transformer-based model with more than 150 million parameters to assist with SDLC management. It minimizes manual effort errors, optimizes resource allocation, and improves decision-making processes, resulting in substantial cost savings. The statistical analysis shows that it saves around 53.33% of costs in an experimental project. The transformer model has been trained with a uniquely prepared dataset tailored for SDLC through transfer learning. It achieved impressive results, with an accuracy of 91.5%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.3%, and an F1-score of 91.5%, demonstrating its high reliability and performance. The perplexity score of 15 further indicates the modelâs strong language understanding capabilities to retrieve relations from complex characteristics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The AI-Analyst framework represents a significant advancement in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SDLC, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for optimizing business processes.",

Chip design houses and consumer electronics companies must continuously pursue New Tape Out (NTO) to maintain technological leadership. Timely NTO completion expedites product launches, crucial in the competitive semiconductor market. This paper addresses Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) hotspot, critical in NTO quality and cycle time, affecting wafer surface topology. Hotspot defects can degrade wafer performance, demanding swift detection and resolution. Traditional methods can only identify CMP hotspot after manufacturing, necessitating repeated adjustments to IC design. We propose HotspotFusion, leveraging pattern density data from Graphic Design System (GDS) to predict CMP hotspot early in the design phase. Utilizing a generative AI model, HotspotFusion significantly reduces NTO cycle time by enabling proactive hotspot detection and process optimization, fostering efficiency and competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Discrete AI inference cards, operating under form-factor and system-defined peak power constraints, must serve diverse inference requests with widely varying power consumption. A peak current-limiting scheme is proposed to maximize inference performance across practical use cases. The peak current management block consists of a card-level current sensing circuit with an AI inference-aware feed-forward and feedback control mechanism. The card-level sensing improves performance by eliminating the need for additional margins for power consumed by off-chip components. Compiler-assisted feed-forward control exploits the predictability of AI inferences and proactively manages peak currents without a static reduction in operating frequency. Measurements from an AI system on chip (SoC), fabricated in 5-nm technology, show up to 41% improvement in BertâLarge inference throughput by engaging the peak current control.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of 5G commercialization, the need for more reliable, faster, and intelligent telecommunication systems is envisaged for the next generation beyond 5G (B5G) radio access technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are immensely popular in service layer applications and have been proposed as essential enablers in many aspects of 5G and beyond networks, from IoT devices and edge computing to cloud-based infrastructures. However, existing 5G ML-based security surveys tend to emphasize AI/ML model performance and accuracy more than the modelsâ accountability and trustworthiness. In contrast, this paper explores the potential of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, which would allow stakeholders in 5G and beyond to inspect intelligent black-box systems used to secure next-generation networks. The goal of using XAI in the security domain of 5G and beyond is to allow the decision-making processes of ML-based security systems to be transparent and comprehensible to 5G and beyond stakeholders, making the systems accountable for automated actions. In every facet of the forthcoming B5G era, including B5G technologies such as ORAN, zero-touch network management, and end-to-end slicing, this survey emphasizes the role of XAI in them that the general users would ultimately enjoy. Furthermore, we presented the lessons from recent efforts and future research directions on top of the currently conducted projects involving XAI.",

However, the diversity in user requirements and the heterogeneity in network resources challenge conventional network operators in network management and service provision. In this paper, we investigate the artificial intelligence (AI) service provision in the multi-layer heterogeneous network. To provide ubiquitous intelligence to users with different computing requirements, an intelligence-native network architecture is designed. Based on the proposed architecture and the AI model stitching mechanism, we formulate the joint AI provision and access selection problem as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem to maximize the average user satisfaction value and user satisfaction rate. Then, a heuristic solution based on Dung Beetle algorithm is proposed to optimize the AI model selection, AI service deployment, user access, and stitching coefficient jointly. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed architecture and algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Designing an efficient and equitable communication service policy for sparsely distributed mobile users across extensive areas poses a considerable challenge in the field of trajectory planning for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Base Stations (BS). The challenge arises due to the dispersed nature of User Terminals (UTs) and the restricted sensor range of the UAVs, which frequently results in overlooking the communication requirements of certain edge users. In response to this challenge, a fairness model has been proposed to prioritize edge users and ensure a balanced user experience. Furthermore, an innovative UAV-BS cooperation algorithm has been introduced to effectively manage sparse observation features and enhance the UAV-BSsâ understanding of the environment through a node-level attention mechanism and a semantic-level aggregating mechanism. Additionally, the proposed enhances coordination among UAV-BSs through a CTDE (Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution) method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods up to 36% in communication rate and 33% in fairness.",

    "abstract": "Most Analog Compute-in-Memory (ACiM) works only focus on the multiple-accumulate (MAC) operation while neglecting the activation function (AF) in the digital domain. The frequent data conversion greatly reduces the benefits obtained by analog computing. This paper proposes an efficient 8-bit inmemory MAC with hybrid capacitor ladders. Then a sparsityaware R-2R DAC and an embedded SAR-ADC that reuses the capacitor ladders in the MAC are introduced to reduce the conversion overhead. Two on-chip AF schemes are included to further improve efficiency. Finally, differential signal path offers 1st order PVT cancellation that improves computing accuracy and reduces the need for calibration.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity across academia and various industries due to their ability to operate in challenging and complex environments. They are particularly valuable in emergency response scenarios where conventional communication infrastructure is unavailable. However, deploying UAVs in such situations poses challenges, requiring intelligent decision-making to meet mission-critical network (MCN) constraints such as latency, quality-of-service, and reliability. To overcome those challenges, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview ranging from knowledge driven (Semantic) approaches to generative artificial intelligence (GAI) by integrating UAVs into MCNs. Initially, existing technologies used in UAV-assisted communication are reviewed. While previous literature often emphasizes UAVsâ general applications, it tends to overlook their specific role in MCN scenarios and lacks depth in discussing emerging technologies. Therefore, state-of-the-art data-driven and intelligent future approaches are presented as key enablers for future UAV-assisted MCNs. Representative technologies include semantic communication, Native AI, GAI, joint sensing and communication (JSAC), open-radio access networks (O-RAN), and digital twins. For instance, these technologies prove beneficial when traditional networks fail, allowing UAVs equipped with advanced intelligent systems to establish resilient links, collect real-time data, transmit meaningful information with minimal delay, and optimize resource allocation. Finally, research challenges are outlined, and potential research directions are proposed to encourage further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an increasingly active area of research that combines symbolic reasoning methods with deep learning to leverage their complementary benefits. As knowledge graphs (KGs) are becoming a popular way to represent heterogeneous and multirelational data, methods for reasoning on graph structures have attempted to follow this neurosymbolic paradigm. Traditionally, such approaches have utilized either rule-based inference or generated representative numerical embeddings from which patterns could be extracted. However, several recent studies have attempted to bridge this dichotomy to generate models that facilitate interpretability, maintain competitive performance, and integrate expert knowledge. Therefore, we survey methods that perform neurosymbolic reasoning tasks on KGs and propose a novel taxonomy by which we can classify them. Specifically, we propose three major categories: 1) logically informed embedding approaches; 2) embedding approaches with logical constraints; and 3) rule-learning approaches. Alongside the taxonomy, we provide a tabular overview of the approaches and links to their source code, if available, for more direct comparison. Finally, we discuss the unique characteristics and limitations of these methods and then propose several prospective directions toward which this field of research could evolve.",

As a digital ledger technology, blockchain establishes a distributed platform for transparent and reliable transactions. On the other hand, AI automates and enhances decision-making in business activities and personal contexts. While each technology excels in its own right, their integration mutually benefits and forms a powerful alliance that provides substantial value. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of current research on the integration of AI and blockchain. Specifically, it explores how blockchain enhances AI functionality, how AI supports blockchain, the advantages derived from their convergence in securing and improving various domains including IoT applications and beyond, as well as the challenges, opportunities, emerging trends, and future research directions in exploring their convergence.",

Despite the great success, it lacks a holistic evaluation of their efficacy. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of publicly available large multimodal models by building an LVLM evaluation Hub (LVLM-eHub). Our LVLM-eHub consists of 13 representative LVLMs such as InstructBLIP and LLaVA, which are thoroughly evaluated by a quantitative capability evaluation and an online arena platform. The former evaluates five categories of multimodal capabilities of LVLMs such as visual question answering and object hallucination on 42 in-domain text-related visual benchmarks, while the latter provides the user-level evaluation of LVLMs in an open-world question-answering scenario. The study investigates how specific features of LVLMs such as model configurations, modality alignment mechanisms, and training data affect the multimodal understanding. By conducting a comprehensive comparison of these features on quantitative and arena evaluation, our study uncovers several innovative findings, which establish a fundamental framework for the development and evaluation of innovative strategies aimed at enhancing multimodal techniques. Our LVLM-eHub is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Multi-Modality-Arena .",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and empirical evidence highlights a positive correlation between the flatness of loss landscapes around minima and generalization. However, most current approaches that seek to find flat minima either incur high computational costs or struggle to balance generalization, training stability, and convergence. This work proposes reshaping the loss landscape to induce the optimizer toward flat regions, an approach that has negligible computational costs and does not compromise training stability, convergence, or efficiency. We focus on nonlinear, loss-dependent reshaping functions underpinned by theoretical insights to reshape the loss landscape. To design these functions, we first identify where and how these functions should be applied. With the aid of recently developed tools in stochastic optimization, theoretical analysis shows that steepening the low-loss landscape improves the rate of sharp minimum escape while flattening the high-and ultralow-loss landscapes enhances training stability and optimization performance, respectively. Simulations and experiments reveal that the subtly designed reshaping functions not only induce optimizers to find flat minima and improve generalization performance but also stabilize training, promote optimization, and keep efficiency. Our approach is evaluated on image classification, adversarial robustness, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks and achieves significant improvement in generalization performance with negligible computational cost. We believe that the new perspective introduced in this work will broadly impact the field of deep neural network training. The code is available at https://github.com/LongJin-lab/LLR.",

    "abstract": "PoolFormer is a subset of Transformer neural network with a key difference of replacing computationally demanding token mixer with pooling function. In this work, a memristor-based PoolFormer network modeling and training framework for edge-artificial intelligence (AI) applications is presented. The original PoolFormer structure is further optimized for hardware implementation on RRAM crossbar by replacing the normalization operation with scaling. In addition, the nonidealities of RRAM crossbar from device to array level as well as peripheral readout circuits are analyzed. By integrating these factors into one training framework, the overall neural network performance is evaluated holistically and the impact of nonidealities to the network performance can be effectively mitigated. Implemented in Python and PyTorch, a 16-block PoolFormer network is built with 64 $\times$ 64 four-level RRAM crossbar array model extracted from measurement results. The total number of the proposed Edge PoolFormer network parameters is 0.246 M, which is at least one order smaller than the conventional CNN implementation. This network achieved inference accuracy of 88.07% for CIFAR-10 image classification tasks with accuracy degradation of 1.5% compared to the ideal software model with FP32 precision weights.",

Using BERTopic modeling, a machine learning technique, this research systematically analyzes literature from 2013 to 2024, providing an overview of AI and big data applications mapped to SDGs which is a first. This structured approach identifies key SDGs impacted by these technologies and highlights interdisciplinary methods that further enhance SDG outcomes. AI applications notably improve healthcare by advancing disease tracking, tailored treatments, and precision medicine, fostering universal healthcare and reducing noncommunicable disease mortality. In energy, AI-driven solutions optimize forecasting, grid management, and renewable integration, while in industry, they bolster infrastructure resilience through innovations like predictive maintenance and automated quality control within Industry 4.0 frameworks. The integration of automated text analysis and semantic context captures broad trends, contributing both methodologically and substantively at the intersection of AI and sustainability. Despite these advancements, the study underscores ethical concerns, including data privacy, security, and algorithmic biases. Interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, engineers, environmental scientists, and AI experts is crucial to developing ethical, scalable AI solutions. The study suggests future research focus on AI transparency, scaling across diverse sectors, and integrating advanced techniques such as neurosymbolic AI and quantum neural networks to enhance system reliability.

Unlike conventional virtual reality (VR), IoS seeks to provide multi-sensory experiences, acknowledging that in our physical reality, our perception extends far beyond just sight and sound; it encompasses a range of senses. This article explores the existing technologies driving immersive multi-sensory media, delving into their capabilities and potential applications. This exploration includes a comparative analysis between conventional immersive media streaming and a proposed use case that leverages semantic communication empowered by generative artificial intelligence (AI). The focal point of this analysis is the substantial reduction in bandwidth consumption by 99.93% in the proposed scheme. Through this comparison, we aim to underscore the practical applications of generative AI for immersive media. Concurrently addressing major challenges in this field, such as temporal synchronization of multiple media, ensuring high throughput, minimizing the end-to-end (E2E) latency, and robustness to low bandwidth while outlining future trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research has been conducted on accurate classification of bio-signals for wearable healthcare applications, such as the detection of arrhythmia. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods utilizing dedicated neural networks (NN) have shown potential in classifying multi-class bio-signals. However, the separate designs of processors and sensors has introduced interaction overheads in existing studies, limiting their practicality and efficiency. Furthermore, there is a lack of detailed discussion on the joint design and optimization of bio-signal sensing, NN training, and NN acceleration. To address these challenges in wearable healthcare, this work proposes an efficient and low-latency neuromorphic system, BioPI, from a joint design perspective of sensor, algorithm, and processor. Inspired by biological neural systems, BioPI employs fully-spike dataflow with a hierarchical pipelined architecture, combining a mixed-signal analog-to-spike converter (ASC) and a compact pipelined spiking neural network (SNN) processor with event-triggered power gating. A unique duplicate-merge (DM) SNN algorithm is also presented to optimize the processing of ASC generated data during inference by converting the required SNN structures from 2-D to 1-D, which reduces on-chip memory size and operation numbers for inference by 2.02x and 1.98x, respectively, measured on ECG classification task while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. To validate the system functionality, we built an end-to- end verification platform including a fabricated 40nm ASC chip and a FPAG implementation of the SNN processor. To evaluate the overall energy efficiency of the entire system on silicon, a complete design of BioPI is also implemented in 40nm process and post-layout simulations are conducted. In arrhythmia detection tasks using the MIT-BIH ECG dataset, BioPI achieves an overall accuracy of 97.5% in 4-class classification and an energy efficiency of 0.767uJ/classification, with a merely 12.54us...",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shed light on the development of knowledgeable and versatile AI research assistants in various scientific domains. However, they fall short in biomedical applications due to a lack of proprietary biomedical knowledge and deficiencies in handling biological sequences for molecules and proteins. To address these issues, we present BioMedGPT, a multimodal large language model for assisting biomedical research. We first incorporate domain expertise into LLMs by incremental pre-training on large-scale biomedical literature. Then, we harmonize 2D molecular graphs, protein sequences, and natural language within a unified, parameter-efficient fusion architecture by fine-tuning on multimodal question-answering datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that BioMedGPT performs on par with human experts in comprehending biomedical documents and answering research questions. It also exhibits promising capability in analyzing intricate functions and properties of novel molecules and proteins, surpassing state-of-the-art LLMs by 17.1% and 49.8% absolute gains respectively in ROUGE-L on molecule and protein question-answering.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) server infrastructure has been built to support AI applications and handle data-intensive workloads. AI server infrastructure is the essential building blocks, and errors in AI server infrastructure may lead to fatal consequences to any AI applications built upon it. Compared to traditional software, software for AI server infrastructure is more configurable, and thus more likely to have configuration errors that might prevent correct software behaviors. Previous work on misconfiguration diagnosis requires sufficient execution history or manual intervention, and can hardly diagnose potential misconfigurations which are not triggered at launching. In this paper, we propose a real-time method to address these issues. Specifically, we combine program analysis and real-time log parsing to diagnose configuration errors. It maps each configuration option to the log code by applying program slicing only once, and parses real-time logs during the operation of the AI server without manual intervention. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the core components of Hadoop, an exemplar AI Server Infrastructure Software. The results show that our method mapped more than 80% of the configuration options to log outputs, identified 90% of the configuration read sites as the slicing seeds, and successfully diagnosed about 10% configuration errors that can not be addressed by previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been recognized as a key enabler for next-generation networks in supporting a large variety of compelling applications with challenging requirements. With its widely proved strength and successes, AI has to become an integral part of MEC. In this paper, we present a novel open-source edge AI (OpenEAI) framework that introduces a native AI plane into the recently proposed open-source MEC framework. The AI plane is designed based on two principles: decoupling the edge AI services into independent AI functions; and recomposing the independent edge AI functions into customized OpenEAI instances based on usersâ specific requirements. Typical use cases of OpenEAI are characterized with the aid of a small-scale test network. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges facing OpenEAI.",

    "abstract": "Centrifugal compressors are pivotal in the manufacturing and cooling systems of consumer electronics, critical for ensuring operational efficiency and product quality. As Industry 5.0 emphasizes personalized production, human-centric automation, and sustainability, optimizing these systems is crucial for enhanced production throughput and reduced downtime. This study presents a methodology for fault trend prediction in centrifugal compressors, combining tensor decomposition-based data imputation, VAE-GAN for health indicator (HI) generation, and LSTM networks for time-series forecasting. Missing data is imputed using Tucker decomposition to ensure data integrity. The VAE-GAN model then generates high-fidelity HIs, capturing complex degradation patterns, which are used as inputs for the LSTM network to provide precise forecasts of future health trends. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy and reliability, effectively addressing data incompleteness, non-linear data relationships, and long-term dependency modeling. This approach not only enhances predictive maintenance strategies, increasing efficiency and reducing downtime but also supports sustainable manufacturing practices crucial in the consumer electronics industry under Industry 5.0.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the AI-Generated Optimal Decision (AIGOD) algorithm and the Deep Diffusion Soft Actor-Critic (DDSAC) framework, marking a significant advancement in integrating Human Digital Twins (HDTs) with AI-Generated Content (AIGC) within IoMT-based smart homes. Our innovative AI-Generated Content-as-a-Service (AIGCaaS) architecture, optimized for IoMT environments, leverages network edge servers to enhance the selection of AI-Generated Content Service Providers (AISPs) tailored to the unique characteristics of individual HDTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate DDSACâs HDT-centric approach outperforms traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, offering optimal AIGC services for diverse healthcare needs. Specifically, DDSAC achieved a 20% improvement in task completion rates and a 15% increase in overall utility compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the potential of HDTs in personalized healthcare by simulating and predicting patient-specific medical outcomes, leading to proactive and timely interventions. This integration facilitates personalized healthcare, establishing a new standard for patient-centric care in smart home environments. By leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques, our research significantly contributes to the fields of IoMT and AIGC, paving the way for smarter and more responsive healthcare services.",

    "abstract": "Drones are sophisticated machines that can hover over extreme locations, conduct aerial surveillance, collect surveillance data, and disseminate it to the distributed edge for processing and analysis. The distributed edge deploys advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to detect any unwarranted activity or object based on surveillance data. However, these lightweight and low-power Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) may experience faults due to unprecedented workload when deployed in extreme surveillance domains. In this paper, we have designed an AI framework to detect any safety concerns with drones deployed for aerial surveillance in extreme locations based on real-time drone critical parameters. We also propose a MapReduce-based object recognition and classification module to process large-scale images captured by drones efficiently. However, conventional AI systems behave like black box systems, leading to a lack of trust and transparency. Thus, we convert the traditional framework of AI into an explainable edge AI framework using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) that opens Pandoraâs black box. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting drone safety concerns through explainable health status tracking alongside ensuring an effective object detection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The success of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in multiple disciplines and vertical domains in recent years has promoted the evolution of mobile networking and the future Internet toward an AI-integrated Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. Nevertheless, most AI techniques rely on data generated by physical devices (e.g., mobile devices and network nodes) or specific applications (e.g., fitness trackers and mobile gaming). Therefore, Generative AI (GAI), a.k.a. AI-generated content (AIGC), has emerged as a powerful AI paradigm; thanks to its ability to efficiently learn complex data distributions and generate synthetic data to represent the original data in various forms. This impressive feature is projected to transform the management of mobile networking and diversify the current services and applications provided. On this basis, this work presents a concise tutorial on the role of GAIs in mobile and wireless networking. In particular, this survey first provides the fundamentals of GAI and representative GAI models, serving as an essential preliminary to the understanding of GAIâs applications in mobile and wireless networking. Then, this work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies and GAI applications in network management, wireless security, semantic communication, and lessons learned from the open literature. Finally, this work summarizes the current research on GAI for mobile and wireless networking by outlining important challenges that need to be resolved to facilitate the development and applicability of GAI in this edge-cutting area.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we investigate the influence of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated photographs on malicious bots that engage in disinformation, fraud, reputation manipulation, and other types of malicious activity on social networks. Our research aims to compare the performance metrics of social bots that employ AI photos with those that use other types of photographs. To accomplish this, we analyzed a dataset with 13 748 measurements of 11 423 bots from the VK social network and identified 73 cases where bots employed generative adversarial network (GAN)-photos and 84 cases where bots employed diffusion or transformers photos. We conducted a qualitative comparison of these bots using metrics such as price, survival rate, quality, speed, and human trust. Our study findings indicate that bots that use AI-photos exhibit less danger and lower levels of sophistication compared to other types: AI-enhanced bots are less expensive, less popular on exchange platforms, of inferior quality, less likely to be operated by humans, and, as a consequence, faster and more susceptible to being blocked by social networks. We also did not observe any significant difference between GAN-based and diffusion/transformers-based bots, indicating that diffusion/transformers models did not contribute to increased bot sophistication compared to GAN models. Our contributions include a proposed methodology for evaluating the impact of photos on bot sophistication, along with a publicly available dataset for other researchers to study and analyze bots. Our research findings suggest a contradiction to theoretical expectations: in practice, bots using AI-generated photos pose less danger.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most representative recommendation solutions, traditional collaborative filtering models typically have limitations in dealing with large-scale, sparse data to capture complex relationships between users and items. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools such as deep neural networks to overcome the data sparsity issue with typical collaborative filtering models. Existing works on AI driven recommender systems are focusing on improving recommendation accuracy by extracting rich user/item features from multi-source data with deep learning tools to build more accurate user preference model. How to ensure the responsibility of AI driven recommender systems is still a big challenge. On one hand, AI driven recommender systems need to access raw data such as user profiles to train recommendation model, which face the risk of leaking user privacy information. On the other hand, the ever increasing volume of user/item interaction records raise the efficien...",

    "abstract": "New Product Development (NPD) requires multidisciplinary collaboration between internal (e.g., designers, engineers, project managers) and increasingly external stakeholders (e.g., customers). These collaborations aim to create new products that meet market needs, deliver value to customers and end-users, and generate revenue for firms. However, the rate of NPD failure is high with traditional NPD often facing significant challenges that can limit productivity and product innovation performance; these include lengthy development cycles and limited market insights. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential collaborator for NPD teams. Much like the emergence of rapid prototyping in the 1980s, which is now widely accepted as a standard NPD tool in most engineering firms, AI promises to revolutionize NPD by improving decision-making, reducing development time, and providing deeper market insights. This paper examines the current state of AI in NPD, reviewing its application across various industries and at different stages of the NPD lifecycle. In addition, the paper outlines some of the key implications of AI adoption for technology and engineering managers, emphasizing the need for AI infrastructure investment, regulatory compliance, strategic planning and cultural change, cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and employee development.",

    "abstract": "Distributed optical fiber sensor based on optical frequency domain reflectometer (OFDR) preserves its dominant position in strain measurement fields with high sensitivity, spatial resolution. However, the cross-correlation based frequency-OFDR will degrade the spatial resolution due to the calculation of adding window. The advent of phase-OFDR has significantly alleviated this issue, but it is more susceptible to phase noise. In this paper, the position mismatch compensation-outlier phase correction (PMC-OPC) scheme combined with the backscattering enhanced optical fiber (BEOF) is proposed to address the phase noise problem. The BEOF with high intensity and phase signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) facilitates the expansion of the strain detection range and the suppression of the phase fading noise. Additionally, it is utilized to identify positional offset on the basis of its distinctive periodicity characteristics. The PMC-OPC approach is employed to address the position mismatch, phase hopping, and random nonlinear phase noise. In the experiments, the high-resolution distributed strain measurement is simultaneously achieved with the theoretical spatial and strain resolutions of 40 Î¼m and 21.05 nÏµ under the conditions of 20 nm sweeping range, 25 dB BEOF intensity enhancement, and the strain measurement range of 3600 Î¼Ïµ. Furthermore, the actual sensing spatial and strain resolutions are measured to be 23.2 mm and 4 Î¼Ïµ, respectively. The proposed approach not only enables the positioning resolution to reach the theoretical limit of the OFDR system within the given sweep range, but also mitigates the inherent trade-off between the spatial resolution and strain resolution.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has driven revolutionary applications like ChatGPT. The widespread use of these applications relies on a mixture of experts (MoE), which contains multiple experts, and selectively engages them for each task to lower operation costs while maintaining performance. Despite MoE, GAI faces challenges in resource consumption when deployed on user devices. Hence, this article proposes mobile edge networks supported MoE-based GAI. We first review the MoE from traditional AI and GAI perspectives, including structure, principles, and applications. We then propose a framework that transfers subtasks to experts in mobile edge networks, aiding GAI model operation on user devices. We discuss challenges in this process and introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to select edge experts for subtask execution. Experimental results show that our framework not only facilitates GAI's deployment on resource-limited devices, but also generates higher-quality content compared to methods without edge network support.",

    "abstract": "Affective computing often relies on audiovisual data to identify affective states from non-verbal signals, such as facial expressions and vocal cues. Since automatic affect recognition can be used in sensitive applications, such as healthcare and education, it is crucial to understand how models arrive at their decisions. Interpretability of machine learning models is the goal of the emerging research area of Explainable AI (XAI). This scoping review aims to survey the field of audiovisual affective machine learning to identify how XAI is applied in this domain. We first provide an overview of XAI concepts relevant to affective computing. Next, following the recommended PRISMA guidelines, we perform a literature search in the ACM, IEEE, Web of Science and PubMed databases. After systematically reviewing 1190 articles, a final set of 65 papers is included in our analysis. We quantitatively summarize the scope, methods and evaluation of the XAI techniques used in the identified papers. Our findings show encouraging developments for using XAI to explain models in audiovisual affective computing, yet only a limited set of methods are used in the reviewed works. Following a critical discussion, we provide recommendations for incorporating interpretability in future work for affective machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GAI) holds great potential to improve software engineering productivity, but its untrustworthy outputs, particularly in code synthesis, pose significant challenges. The need for extensive verification and validation (V&V) of GAI-generated artifacts may undermine the potential productivity gains. This paper proposes a way of mitigating these risks by exploiting GAIâs ability to generate multiple versions of code and tests to facilitate comparative analysis across versions. Rather than relying on the quality of a single test or code module, this âdifferential GAIâ (D-GAI) approach promotes more reliable quality evaluation through version diversity. We introduce the Large-Scale Software Observatorium (LASSO), a platform that supports D-GAI by executing and analyzing large sets of code versions and tests. We discuss how LASSO enables rigorous evaluation of GAI-generated artifacts and propose its application in both software development and GAI research.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, artificial intelligence in medicine plays a leading role. This necessitates the need to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are not only high-performing but also comprehensible to all stakeholders involved, including doctors, patients, healthcare providers, etc. As a result, the explainability of artificial intelligence systems has become a widely discussed subject in recent times, leading to the publication of numerous approaches and solutions. In this paper, we aimed to provide a systematic review of these approaches in order to analyze their role in making artificial intelligence interpretable for everyone. The conducted review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA statement.We conducted a BIAS analysis, identifying 87 scientific papers from those retrieved as having a low risk of BIAS. Subsequently, we defined a classification framework based on the classification taxonomy and applied it to analyze these papers. The results show that, although most AI approaches in medicine currently incorporate explainability methods, the evaluation of these systems is not always performed. When evaluation does occur, it is most often focused on improving the system itself rather than assessing usersâ perception of the systemâs effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a framework for evaluating explainability approaches in medicine, aimed at guiding developers in designing effective human-centered methods.",

    "abstract": "Soft robots show compliance and have infinite degrees of freedom. Thanks to these properties, such robots can be leveraged for surgery, rehabilitation, biomimetics, unstructured environment exploring, and industrial grippers. In this case, they attract scholars from a variety of areas. However, nonlinearity and hysteresis effects also bring a burden to robot modeling. Moreover, following their flexibility and adaptation, soft robot control is more challenging than rigid robot control. In order to model and control soft robots, a large number of data-driven methods are utilized in pairs or separately. This review first briefly introduces two foundations for data-driven approaches, which are physical models and the Jacobian matrix, then summarizes three kinds of data-driven approaches, which are statistical method, neural network, and reinforcement learning. This review compares the modeling and controller features, e.g., model dynamics, data requirement, and target task, within and among these categories. Finally, we summarize the features of each method. A discussion about the advantages and limitations of the existing modeling and control approaches is presented, and we forecast the future of data-driven approaches in soft robots. A website (https://sites.google.com/view/23zcb) is built for this review and will be updated frequently. Note to Practitioners âThis work is motivated by the need for a review introducing soft robot modeling and control methods in parallel. Modeling and control play significant roles in robot research, and they are challenging especially for soft robots. The nonlinear and complex deformation of such robots necessitates specific modeling and control approaches. We introduce the state-of-the-art data-driven methods and survey three approaches widely utilized. This review also compares the performance of these methods, considering some important features like data amount requirement, control frequency, and target task. The features of each ...",

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) coordinates a great number of distributed access points (APs) with central processing units (CPUs), effectively reducing interference and ensuring uniform service quality for user equipment (UEs). However, its cooperative nature can result in intense fronthaul signaling between CPUs in large-scale networks. To reduce the inter-CPU fronthaul signaling for systems with limited fronthaul capacity, we propose a low-complexity online UE-AP association approach for scalable CFmMIMO that combines network- and user-centric clustering methodologies, relies on local channel information only, and can handle dynamic UE arrivals. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art method on fronthaul signaling minimization, our approach can save up to 94% of the fronthaul signaling load and 83% of the CPU processing power at the cost of only up to 8.6% spectral efficiency loss, or no loss in some cases.",

The dataset provides multi-modal data of 40 participants including audio, video (motion capturing, facial landmarks, eye tracking) as well as physiological information (photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity). In addition to that, the dataset contains time-continuous annotations for stress and occurred emotions (e.g., shame, anger, anxiety, and surprise). In order to establish a baseline, five different machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Feed-forward Neural Network, and Long-Short-Term Memory Network) have been trained and evaluated on the presented dataset for a binary stress classification task. The best-performing classifier has been a Long-Short-Term Memory Network, which achieved an accuracy of 91.7% and an F1-score of 90.2%. The ForDigitStress dataset is freely available to other researchers.",

    "abstract": "Various new brain-computer interface technologies or neuroscience applications require decoding stimulus-following neural responses to natural stimuli such as speech and video from, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this context, generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) is often used as a group analysis technique, which allows the extraction of correlated signal components from the neural activity of multiple subjects attending to the same stimulus. GCCA can be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus-following neural responses relative to all other irrelevant ( non-)neural activity, or to quantify the correlated neural activity across multiple subjects in a group- wise coherence metric. However, the traditional GCCA technique is stimulus-unaware: no information about the stimulus is used to estimate the correlated components from the neural data of several subjects. Therefore, the GCCA technique might fail to extract relevant correlated signal components in practical situations where the amount of information is limited, for example, because of a limited amount of training data or group size. This motivates a new stimulus-informed GCCA (SI-GCCA) framework that allows taking the stimulus into account to extract the correlated components. We show that SI-GCCA outperforms GCCA in various practical settings, for both auditory and visual stimuli. Moreover, we showcase how SI-GCCA can be used to steer the estimation of the components towards the stimulus. As such, SI-GCCA substantially improves upon GCCA for various purposes, ranging from preprocessing to quantifying attention.",

    "abstract": "In the investment industry, it is often essential to carry out fine-grained company similarity quantification for a range of purposes, including market mapping, competitor analysis, and mergers and acquisitions. We propose and publish a knowledge graph, named CompanyKG, to represent and learn diverse company features and relations. Specifically, 1.17 million companies are represented as nodes enriched with company description embeddings; and 15 different inter-company relations result in 51.06 million weighted edges. To enable a comprehensive assessment of methods for company similarity quantification, we have devised and compiled three evaluation tasks with annotated test sets: similarity prediction, competitor retrieval and similarity ranking. We present extensive benchmarking results for 11 reproducible predictive methods categorized into three groups: node-only, edge-only, and node+edge. To the best of our knowledge, CompanyKG is the first large-scale heterogeneous graph dataset originating from a real-world investment platform, tailored for quantifying inter-company similarity",

    "abstract": "In telemanipulation, supplementary feedback can enhance operator perception and control precision. This study introduces a haptic interface designed to convey temporally discrete tactile cues when remotely controlling a robot. Low-profile piezoelectric sensors were integrated in the thumb of a robotic hand to capture the key events of the manipulation task (i.e., object contact and release). Synchronously with such events, pressure bursts were delivered to the operators fingertip through a soft textile thimble equipped with inflatable pockets. Both this haptic display and the sensing module were individually evaluated. The pneumatic system responsible for pockets inflation was characterized in terms of reaction time, proving suitable for the application with a latency of less than 70 ms. Regarding the sensing module, the behavior of the sensorized thumb was first evaluated under static conditions, identifying contact and release events when grasping with the robotic hand differently shaped objects fixed on a table. Then, the accuracy of the touch event detection was assessed while performing a more complex manipulation task (i.e., a pick and lift task). This evaluation was conducted first with the robot programmed to grasp and lift an object following pre-defined trajectories, where we measured accuracy of 100% for contact and 90% for release event detection. Then, we performed a telemanipulation pilot study involving eight participants, where the system proved capable of correctly detecting object contact and release events with an accuracy of 100 and 86.4%. Despite preliminary, these results confirmed proper functioning of the system and paved the way for the exploration of a new haptic feedback policy in telemanipulation based on temporally discrete tactile events.",

    "abstract": "Industry 5.0 has become a reality now and it is a paradigm that integrates contemporary innovations and concepts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key component and asset of the industrial transformation which allows intelligent devices to perform functionalities such as self-examination, assessment, and evaluation autonomously. AI-based methodologies using ML and deep learning assist manufacturers and industrialists in forecasting service requirements and minimizing downtime. Recent research has discovered a remarkable change in the processes, systems, applications, and products in industries. Also, there is a significant challenge with the explainability of the decisions provided by the models using deep learning algorithms and their inadequate ability to be coupled with each other. Therefore, Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is required without compromising the efficiency of the models developed using deep learning algorithms. XAI investigates and develops algorithms, techniques, and models that produce human-comprehensible explanations of AI-based systems and can increase transparency and performance. The explainability nature of XAI will help humans understand the model and the reason behind the predictions, thus improving the modelâs transparency and the reliability of the outcomes. Furthermore, an Industry 5.0-enabled environment has a variety of data from varied sources, and this multi-source information must be fused to derive meaningful and optimal decisions. Therefore, all AI-integrated applications must derive actionable insights through information fusion. Hence, the adoption of XAI methodologies in Industry 5.0 can help humans make trustworthy decisions for critical applications requiring information fusion. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art survey on adopting XAI in Industry 5.0. We discuss the adoption of XAI in various applications such as smart factories, smart Healthcare, E-Governance, smart transportation, Education 5.0, Agri...",

    "abstract": "Embodied intelligence has always been regarded as the ultimate form of artificial intelligence (AI) and an ideal concept for smart manufacturing. With the development of AI foundation models, remarkable generalization capabilities have been achieved in various fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision. In the era of AI foundation models, embodied intelligence will be capable of continuous evolution for unlimited tasks with multimodal physical interaction in the open world. Therefore, it is envisioned that embodied intelligence should be integrated into smart manufacturing to upgrade the industry for more intelligent, flexible, and human-centric manufacturing in the future. Therefore, in this article, the definition and components of embodied intelligence are proposed with its novel characteristics. Besides, the capabilities of embodied intelligence in the era of AI foundation model are discussed. Moreover, typical innovative applications of embodied intelligence throughout the whole product life cycle for smart manufacturing are presented with insights. However, embodied intelligence still faces some challenges for implementation. Thus, in the prospect of future, challenges and outlooks of embodied intelligence are discussed for further research and applications.",

    "abstract": "Energy-efficient computing is essential for addressing the rising power demands of modern data-intensive applications and ensuring sustainable technology advancement. Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) has emerged as a pivotal technology in this domain, offering nonvolatile memory solutions that combine low power consumption with high performance. Spin-orbit torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) and its variants stand out for its potential to deliver SRAM-like performance at a higher bit-cell density. In this paper, we present a novel high-density STT-assisted SOT-MRAM (SAS-MRAM) technology designed for energy-efficient AI applications. SAS-MRAM capitalizes on the advantages of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms, utilizing a multi-bit-shared SOT line to achieve high-speed, high-density, and high-endurance memory performance. Our experimental results validate the potential of SAS-MRAM to address limitations of current memory technologies. An AI application of ResNet-18 deployed in SAS-MRAM shows ~32.7Ã energy-delay-product (EDP) benefits comparing to that in SRAM, presenting a promising solution for future AI hardware implementations, especially at edge where low power training and inference of AI models are necessary.",

    "abstract": "While artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant benefits, it also has negatively impacted humans and society. A human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has been proposed to address these issues. However, current HCAI practices have shown limited contributions due to a lack of sociotechnical thinking. To overcome these challenges, we conducted a literature review and comparative analysis of sociotechnical characteristics with respect to AI. Then, we propose updated sociotechnical systems (STS) design principles. Based on these findings, this paper introduces an intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS) framework to extend traditional STS theory and meet the demands with respect to AI. The iSTS framework emphasizes human-centered joint optimization across individual, organizational, ecosystem, and societal levels. The paper further integrates iSTS with current HCAI practices, proposing a hierarchical HCAI (hHCAI) approach. This hHCAI approach offers a structured approach to address challenges in HCAI practices from a broader sociotechnical perspective. Finally, we provide recommendations for future iSTS and hHCAI work.",

    "abstract": "Learning from AI-generated annotations is wellrecognized as a key advance of deep learning techniques in medical image segmentation. Towards this direction, in this paper, we investigate two questions: (1) how to accurately measure loss value on AI-generated annotations that often contain errors and (2) how to effectively update modelâs parameters when the loss value is no longer a correct supervision for medical image segmentation. The main results are that (1) âerror-tolerantâ loss functions exist and (2) âcross-trainingâ, updating the model using data with a small loss of its âtwinâ model, can tolerate the loss function to some extent. Per the main results, we yet derived a robust training algorithm, called confidence regularized coteaching, that helps deep models to combat annotation errors in medical image segmentation. This algorithm simultaneously trains two âtwinâ segmentation models and updates modelâs parameters by cross-training with disagreement confident data that are predicted differently by the two models, thereby being able to learning from data with annotation errors. The empirical evidence from a publicly available dataset shows that this new algorithm works better on combating annotation errors than existing methods for medical image segmentation, opening the opportunity to use AI-generated annotations to train segmentation model for medical image segmentation.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Images (AIGIs) has greatly expanded the Image Naturalness Assessment (INA) problem. Different from early definitions that mainly focus on tone-mapped images with limited distortions ( e.g. , exposure, contrast, and color reproduction), INA on AI-generated images is especially challenging as it owns more diverse contents and could be affected by factors from multiple perspectives, including low-level technical distortions andhigh-level rationality distortions. In this paper, we take the first step to benchmark and assess the visual naturalness of AI-generated images. First, we construct the AI-Generated Image Naturalness (AGIN) dataset by conducting a large-scale subjective study to collect human opinions on the overall naturalness as well as perceptions from the technical quality and rationality perspectives. AGIN verifies several insights for the first time that naturalness is universally and disparately affected by both technical and rational distortions, while its manifestations vary with different generation tasks. Second, to automatically assess the naturalness of AIGIs that align with human opinions, we propose the JointObjective Image Naturalness evaluaTor (JOINT). Specifically, JOINT imitates human reasoning in naturalness evaluation by jointly learning technical and rationality features with several specific designs to guide model behavior from respective perspectives. Experiments demonstrate that JOINT significantly outperforms existing methods for providing more subjectively consistent results on naturalness assessment. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/zijianchen98/AGIN.",

    "abstract": "In the future, 6G network is expected to achieve deep integration of communication and computation, where computation-centric services will be ubiquitous in the network. There are differences in data size, computing power types (CPU/GPU), model complexity, and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements among various CPU computing services and artificial intelligence (AI) services. By providing AI as a Service (AIaaS) in 6G network, the deployment of AI models and the scheduling of task and computing resources can be accelerated. The fundamental challenge lies in the effective amalgamation of the long-term strategy of the model placement problem and the short-term strategy of the task scheduling problem to attain dynamic scheduling and management of tasks and heterogeneous computing resources. A two-timescale optimization method for joint task offloading, computing resource allocation and model placement is proposed in this paper. We present an edge-network-cloud framework that configures AIaaS functional units, taking into account the heterogeneous computing requirements and QoS demands of different services. A long-term problem to minimize latency and energy consumption is formulated. To work out the coupled optimization parameters, the problem is decomposed into short-term deterministic sub-problems using Lyapunov optimization. We propose low-complexity algorithms for joint task offloading strategy based on deferred acceptance algorithm, computing resource allocation strategy based on convex optimization, and model placement strategy based on multi-armed bandits. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms reinforcement learning and other popular optimization algorithms in terms of complexity and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In a space-based automatic identification system (AIS), a satellite has a wide coverage area and thus can receive AIS signals from ships in the high seas. However, wide coverage can cause multiple AIS packets to collide with each other at the satellite receiver. Furthermore, transmitted packets are affected by channel parameters, such as Doppler shifts, channel impulse response, and propagation delay time, which are remarkably different in each packet because these parameters depend on the distance and relative speed between ships and the satellite. Therefore, these parameters should be estimated and used for multiuser detection to detect collided packets separately. Nevertheless, when the received power difference between packets or desired to undesired signal power ratio (DUR) is low, the accuracy of the channel parameter estimation is degraded so severely, such that multiuser detection cannot maintain sufficient bit error rate (BER) performance. To compensate for the reduced accuracy, this paper proposes a highly accurate channel estimation method. In addition to the conventional correlation-based channel estimation, the proposed method applies the quasi-Newton and least-squares methods to estimate Doppler frequency and channel impulse response, respectively. Regarding the propagation delay time, the conventional correlation-based channel estimation is repeated for improvement. Multiuser detection based on the Viterbi algorithm is performed using the estimated channel parameters. Computer simulations were conducted under the conditions of two collision packets and Rician fading, and the results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of the channel estimation and BER performance than the conventional method.",

This study proposed a comprehensive analysis of the Transformer-based Inverse Learning model to optimize component and process recommendations. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation was first applied, improving data accuracy and completeness to address data gaps. Subsequently, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) were used for data augmentation, enriching the datasetâs diversity. The Transformer model, leveraging this enhanced data, demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving an R2 score of 0.966 for component analysis and an outstanding R2 score of 0.982 for process analysis in Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) material data. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining imputation, augmentation, and advanced AI modeling in capturing complex material properties. The study highlights the potential of AI-driven methodologies to significantly improve prediction accuracy in material discovery, offering valuable insights for the development of future ceramic materials.",

We introduce a novel approach harnessing the capabilities of AI-driven method to extract valuable insights from extensive medical datasets, facilitating more efficient and precise healthcare decision-making processes. The proposed model integrates a recurrent layer founded on bidirectional long short-term memory with a transformer layer incorporating a multi-channel self-attention mechanism. We introduce a weight-based auxiliary training promotion method to enhance the modelâs performance and robustness further. Experiments conducted on two widely-used benchmark datasets, namely the 2010 i2b2/VA and SemEval 2013 DDI datasets, illustrate the proposed modelâs superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 scores on both datasets, surpassing the baseline approaches by a considerable margin. Moreover, the proposed model exhibits faster convergence and improved generalization ability, making it more efficient and practical for real-world applications. Integrating AI-driven method in healthcare consumer electronics holds great promise for revolutionizing how medical records are analyzed and utilized, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and personalized healthcare solutions.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of industries, mainly thanks to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that needs powerful resources. Cloud computing is a promising approach to serve AI applications thanks to its high processing power, but this sometimes results in an unacceptable latency because of long-distance communication. Vice versa, edge computing is close to where data are generated and therefore it is becoming crucial for their timely, flexible, and secure management. Given the more distributed nature of the edge and the heterogeneity of its resources, efficient component placement and resource allocation approaches become critical in orchestrating the application execution. In this paper, we formulate the resource selection and AI applications component placement problem in a computing continuum as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP), and we propose a design-time tool for its efficient solution. We first propose a Random Greedy algorithm to minimize the cost of the placement while guaranteeing some response time performance constraints. Then, we develop some heuristic methods such as Local Search, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms, to improve the initial solutions provided by the Random Greedy. To evaluate our proposed approach, we designed an extensive experimental campaign, comparing the heuristics methods with one another and then the best heuristic against Best Cost Performance Constraint (BCPC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art approach. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach finds lower-cost solution than BCPC (27.6% on average) under the same time limit in large-scale systems. Finally, during the validation in a real edge system including FaaS resources our approach finds the globally optimal solution, suffering a deviation of around 12% between actual and predicted costs.",

    "abstract": "Extraction of the correct and efficient descriptors of muscular activity plays a vital role in tackling the challenging problem of myoelectric control of powered prostheses. This work presents a feature extraction framework that aims to enhance the representation of muscular activities by increasing the amount of information that can be extracted from individual and combined electromyogram (EMG) channels. The proposed method for feature selection is based on Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP). The SHAP value is used to reduce the feature dimension. The proposed approach has been evaluated on two datasets obtained at a sampling rate of 1 kHz through a band consisting of seven EMG channels. The Standard deviation (SD) and Integrated EMG (IEMG) of electrodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 recognized four motions with a classification accuracy of 98.42%Â± 1.16% and six gestures with a classification accuracy of 96.6%Â± 0.91%, respectively. In the present work, an ensemble technique called bagging in the random forest algorithm has been used to obtain the optimum results.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) in deriving and analyzing individual gait patterns (i.e., gait signatures) from ground reaction force data. The study leverages three datasets containing 2,092 individuals, including 1,283 cases with pathological gait, and addresses three key objectives: (1) Demonstrating the uniqueness of gait signatures in a large-scale dataset with heterogeneity introduced by patient data and various conditions. (2) Characterizing gait signatures using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to highlight specific features contributing to their uniqueness. (3) Evaluating the reliability of gait signatures and their characterizations across different numbers of individuals and training samples per individual. The results show that ML can accurately differentiate unique gait patterns across healthy individuals and patients with pathological gait patterns, highlighting the importance of considering individual gait signatures in clinical gait analysis. The high reliability of a personâs unique gait signature may bear potential for more personalized treatment decisions and rehabilitation programs, with XAI methods providing valuable insights into the key features characterizing individual gait. The results indicate that even more refined and personalized approaches are possible, extending beyond the conventional categories of pathology, age, and sex. This study provides a foundation for exploring the practical impact of gait signatures on rehabilitation, clinical diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach for automated polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, deploying an enhanced Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with an integrated attention mechanism in the discriminator. Addressing prevalent challenges in conventional segmentation methods, such as variable polyp appearances, inconsistent image quality, and limited training data, our model significantly augments the precision and reliability of polyp segmentation. The integration of an attention mechanism enables our model to meticulously focus on the intricate features of polyps, improving segmentation accuracy. A unique training strategy, employing both real and synthetic data, is adopted to ensure the model's robust performance under a variety of conditions. The results, validated through rigorous tests on multiple public colonoscopy datasets, indicate a notable improvement in segmentation performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our model's enhanced ability to detect critical details early plays a pivotal role in proactive colorectal cancer detection, a key aspect of smart healthcare systems. This work represents an effective amalgamation of advanced AI techniques and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), signifying a noteworthy contribution to the evolution of smart healthcare systems. In conclusion, our attention-enhanced Pix2Pix GAN not only offers efficient and reliable polyp segmentation, but also showcases considerable potential for seamless integration into remote health monitoring systems, underlining the increasing relevance and efficacy of AI in advancing IoMT-enabled healthcare.",

    "abstract": "In the decade, artificial intelligence has achieved great popularity and applications in medicine and healthcare. Various AI-based algorithms have shown astonishing performance. However, in various data-driven smart healthcare algorithms, the problem of incomplete dataset remains a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose a data completeness enhancement algorithm based on generative AI (i.e., GenAI-DAA) to solve the problems of the in-sufficient data for model training, the data imbalance, and the biases of the training samples. We first construct the cognitive field of the generative models and effectively understand the state of incomplete cognition in generative models. Secondly, on this basis, we propose a quest algorithm for abnormal samples in the cognitive field based on local outlier factor. By fine-grained value evaluation, abnormal samples are given more refined attention. Finally, integrating the above process through multiple cognitive adjustments, GenAI-DAA gradually improves the cognitive ability. GenAI-DAA can be summarized as âQuestââEstimateââTune-upâ. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, and shown widely applications to some typical data-driven smart healthcare algorithms",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) stands at the forefront of AI innovation, demonstrating rapid advancement and unparalleled proficiency in generating diverse content. Beyond content creation, GAI has significant analytical abilities to learn complex data distribution, offering numerous opportunities to resolve security issues. In the realm of security from physical layer perspectives, traditional AI approaches frequently struggle, primarily due to their limited capacity to dynamically adjust to the evolving physical attributes of transmission channels and the complexity of contemporary cyber threats. This adaptability and analytical depth are precisely where GAI excels. Therefore, in this paper, we offer an extensive survey on the various applications of GAI in enhancing security within the physical layer of communication networks. We first emphasize the importance of advanced GAI models in this area, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders (AEs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). We delve into the roles of GAI in addressing challenges of physical layer security, focusing on communication confidentiality, authentication, availability, resilience, and integrity. Furthermore, we also present future research directions focusing model improvements, multi-scenario deployment, resource-efficient optimization, and secure semantic communication, highlighting the multifaceted potential of GAI to address emerging challenges in secure physical layer communications and sensing.",

    "abstract": "A prominent use case of consumer electronics-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications, focused on smart cities, is connected devices that enable cities to optimize their operations via access to high volumes of sensitive data. Yet, these devices commonly utilize public channels for data access and sharing, requiring consistent communication protocols and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the aid of AI. However, most of them involve high computation and communication costs. They are not fully reliable, either. Also, AI-based IDS solutions are viewed as black boxes because they cannot justify their decisions. To resolve these issues, we have proposed a framework based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for securing consumer IoT applications in smart cities. At the beginning of the protocol execution, the participants exchange authenticated data through the blockchain-based AKA procedure. Meanwhile, we adopt the Python-based Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) framework to explain and interpret the core features guiding decision-making. The working model of this framework depicts its validation with recent benchmark methods.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative real-time AI posture correction service for three major powerlifting exercises: bench press, squat, and deadlift, utilizing YOLOv5 and MediaPipe. Due to the rising popularity of online fitness apps post-pandemic, there is a need for accurate posture correction tools to prevent injuries associated with incorrect exercise forms. The proposed method involves a comprehensive MultiPose Exercise Dataset (MPED), which collects 3D joint coordinate data from multiple angles using a smartphone camera. This data is used to train machine learning and deep learning models for detailed posture classification and real-time feedback. The AI service offers specific corrective feedback for both concentric and eccentric contractions, improving exercise efficiency and safety. The studyâs results show that models built with machine learning algorithms generally outperform deep learning models for posture classification, and the proposed detailed feedback system is effective in preventing injuries and enhancing performance. This comprehensive approach ensures that users receive tailored feedback to correct their form in real-time, significantly reducing the risk of injury and promoting better overall fitness outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Fueled by healthcare electronics (HE) and artificial intelligence (AI), smart healthcare market has been emerging, such as medical wireless body area network (WBAN), which can be used for daily health and early disease monitoring, where intra-WBAN communication is at the first tier. However, timely message sending and low-power consumption are still two essential issues. Therefore, an AI-generated content-based control strategy called KsCS-DQNs is suggested to address these challenges. Firstly, we establish an asymmetric two-level polling control model for intra-WBAN communication. Then, in order to balance the performance metrics of mean waiting time (MWT), mean queue length (MQL) and fairnes, an optimization algorithm is proposed to handle the optimization problem and achieve convergence in dispersed action space. By utilizing multi-DQN to generate access order and number of health packets that are sent for each node, the optimal MWT and MQL under fairness are gained. Additionally, connection and beacon frames and superframe are simplified to reduce the control overhead, which contributes to the encapsulation of nodes with limited energy and improves their accessibility. Experiments show that KsCS-DQNs outperforms classical methods, such as IEEE 802.15.6 PCF, DQN-P and two-level Gated polling control, especially in an asymmetric system with randomly emergent traffic.",

However, effective treatment through this method requires substantial human resources and can be costly. It also tends to be subjective and lacks real-time responsiveness. With the rapid development of AI-generated content technology, to improve the precision and real-time performance of rehabilitative motion posture recognition and to better assist patients in conducting extended rehabilitation exercises independently at home, this paper proposes an AI-driven network architecture for posture estimation in stroke patient rehabilitation that can generate corresponding posture skeleton content by identifying the patient's posture. This generated content feedback can assist in monitoring and treating stroke patients' rehabilitation. The architecture integrates spatial convolutional layers with an improved transformer module, termed ConvTrans (Integration of Convolution and Transformer). In the ConvTrans block, the use of lightweight multi-head self-attention (LMHSA) and inverted residual forward networks (IRFFN) effectively reduces computational costs and enhances processing efficiency. This configuration captures both information pertaining to local and global structure, thereby enhancing the network's representational capabilities. Demonstrating strong performance on three challenging human pose estimation (HPE) datasets, this method offers efficient feedback on posture to aid in the rehabilitation of individuals affected by strokes.",

    "abstract": "In medical diagnostics, the accurate classification and analysis of biomedical signals play a crucial role, particularly in the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which represent the electrical activity of the brain, are fundamental in identifying epileptic seizures. However, challenges such as data scarcity and imbalance significantly hinder the development of robust diagnostic models. Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we explore enhancing medical signal processing and diagnosis, with a focus on epilepsy classification through EEG signals, by harnessing AI-generated content techniques. We introduce a novel framework that utilizes generative adversarial networks for the generation of synthetic EEG signals to augment existing datasets, thereby mitigating issues of data scarcity and imbalance. Furthermore, we incorporate an attention-based temporal convolutional network model to efficiently process and classify EEG signals by emphasizing salient features crucial for accurate diagnosis. Our comprehensive evaluation, including rigorous ablation studies, is conducted on the widely recognized Bonn Epilepsy Data. The results achieves an accuracy of 98.89% and F1 score of 98.91%. The findings demonstrate substantial improvements in epilepsy classification accuracy, showcasing the potential of AI-generated content in advancing the field of medical signal processing and diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Creating a vivid video from the event or scenario in our imagination is a truly fascinating experience. Recent advancements in text-to-video synthesis have unveiled the potential to achieve this with prompts only. While text is convenient in conveying the overall scene context, it may be insufficient to control precisely. In this paper, we explore customized video generation by utilizing text as context description and motion structure (e.g. frame- wise depth) as concrete guidance. Our method, dubbed Make-Your-Video, involves joint-conditional video generation using a Latent Diffusion Model that is pre-trained for still image synthesis and then promoted for video generation with the introduction of temporal modules. This two-stage learning scheme not only reduces the computing resources required, but also improves the performance by transferring the rich concepts available in image datasets solely into video generation. Moreover, we use a simple yet effective causal attention mask strategy to enable longer video synthesis, which mitigates the potential quality degradation effectively. Experimental results show the superiority of our method over existing baselines, particularly in terms of temporal coherence and fidelity to users' guidance. In addition, our model enables several intriguing applications that demonstrate potential for practical usage.

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels (LNL) has attracted significant attention from the research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean samples tend to have a âsmall loss.â However, this assumption often fails to generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, that is, training subpopulations that vary in sample size or recognition difficulty. Therefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those âinformativeâ samples (e.g., hard samples or samples in the tail subpopulations) into noisy samples, leading to poor generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel LNL method to deal with noisy labels and imbalanced subpopulations simultaneously. It first leverages sample correlation to estimate samplesâ clean probabilities for label correction and then utilizes corrected labels for distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to further improve the robustness. Specifically, in contrast to previous works using classification loss as the selection criterion, we introduce a feature-based metric that takes the sample correlation into account for estimating samplesâ clean probabilities. Then, we refurbish the noisy labels using the estimated clean probabilities and the pseudo-labels from the modelâs predictions. With refurbished labels, we use DRO to train the model to be robust to subpopulation imbalance. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that our technique can consistently improve state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust learning paradigms against noisy labels, especially when encountering imbalanced subpopulations.

    "abstract": "To safely navigate intricate real-world scenarios, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be able to adapt to diverse road conditions and anticipate future events. World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach by learning and predicting the complex dynamics of various environments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an open-source platform for training and testing such algorithms in complicated driving environments. To fill this void, we introduce CarDreamer, the first open-source learning platform designed specifically for developing and evaluating world model based autonomous driving algorithms. It comprises a few key components, including 1) World model (WM) backbone: CarDreamer has integrated some state-of-the-art world models, which simplifies the reproduction of RL algorithms. 2) Built-in tasks: CarDreamer offers a comprehensive set of highly configurable driving tasks which are compatible with Gym interfaces and are equipped with empirically optimized reward functions. 3) Task development suite: CarDreamer integrates a flexible task development suite to streamline the creation of driving tasks. This suite enables easy definition of traffic flows and vehicle routes, along with automatic collection of multi-modal observation data. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments using built-in tasks to evaluate the performance and potential of WMs in autonomous driving. Thanks to the richness and flexibility of CarDreamer, we also systematically study the impact of observation modality, observability, and sharing of vehicle intentions on AV safety and efficiency. All code and documents are accessible on our GitHub page https://github.com/ucd-dare/CarDreamer.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Building large-scale data bases of biomedical signal recordings for training artificial-intelligence systems involves substantial human effort in data processing and annotation. In the case of event detection, experts need to exhaustively scroll through the recordings and highlight events of interest. Methods: We propose an iterative annotation support algorithm with a human in the loop to improve the efficiency of the annotation process. Our algorithm generates proposal events based on an event detection model trained on incomplete annotations. The human only needs to verify candidate events proposed by the tool instead of scrolling through the entire data set. Our algorithm iterates between proposal generation and verification to leverage the human-in-the-loop feedback to obtain a growing set of event annotations. Results: Our algorithm finds a substantial amount of events at a fraction of the human time spent when comparing with a benchmark method and the normal manual process, finding all events in one data set and 70% of events in another with the human-in-the-loop only viewing 20% of the data. Conclusion: Our results show that combining human and computer effort can substantially speed up the annotation process for events in biomedical signal processing. Significance: Due to its simplicity and minimal reliance on task-specific information, our algorithm is broadly applicable, unlocking substantial improvements in the scalability and efficiency of biomedical signal annotation.",

    "abstract": "In totem-pole boost rectifiers, critical mode (CRM) operation is associated with varying switching frequency and duty ratio. This makes it difficult to precisely manage the phase shift between interleaved phases. To address this challenge, we propose a novel interleaving method based on cycle estimation. The switching cycle is estimated by predicting the zero-crossing instants. By analyzing the input current ripple, the relationship among phase shift, duty ratio, and switching cycle can be derived. Therefore, after frequency transition, the phase shift and switching cycle can be updated to provide a precise deadbeat control. Different from conventional methods, the proposed interleaving methods can dynamically modulate the phase shift without the usage of high-speed current sensors. A 1.6 kW, 160--950 kHz GaN-based, two-phase interleaved totem-pole rectifier is designed as the proof of concept. 98.24% peak efficiency and 0.995 power factor are captured. Experimental results effectively validate the interleaving method.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed great success in handling graph-related tasks with graph neural networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNNs are based on message passing to perform feature aggregation and transformation, where the structural information is explicitly involved in the forward propagation by coupling with node features through graph convolution at each layer. As a result, subtle feature noise or structure perturbation may cause severe error propagation, resulting in extremely poor robustness. In this article, we rethink the roles played by graph structural information in graph data training and identify that message passing is not the only path to modeling structural information. Inspired by this, we propose a simple but effective graph structure self-contrasting (GSSC) framework that learns graph structural information without message passing. The proposed framework is based purely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), where the structural information is only implicitly incorporated as prior knowledge to guide the computation of supervision signals, substituting the explicit message propagation as in GNNs. Specifically, it first applies structural sparsification (STR-Sparse) to remove potentially uninformative or noisy edges in the neighborhood, and then performs structural self-contrasting (STR-Contrast) in the sparsified neighborhood to learn robust node representations. Finally, STR-Sparse and self-contrasting are formulated as a bilevel optimization problem and solved in a unified framework. Extensive experiments have qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that the GSSC framework can produce truly encouraging performance with better generalization and robustness than other leading competitors. Codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/LirongWu/GSSC.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for multi-party collaborative data analysis problems, where analysis accuracy and divergence are required, as well as both privacy of shared data and explainability of results. The proposed approach aims at trading-off data privacy, decision explainability, and data utility by analytically relating these three measures, evaluating how they impact each other, and proposing a methodology to find the best possible trade-off among them. In particular, given a set of requirements from the participants for a collaborative analysis problem, we propose a method to properly tune the parameters of privacy-preserving mechanisms and explainability techniques to be adopted by all participants, obtaining the best trade-off . The paper is focused on deep learning-based image data analysis problems, though the approach can be generalized to other data types. The $(\\epsilon , \\delta )$ - Differential Privacy and the Autoencoders privacy-preserving techniques have been adopted to preserve data privacy, while the SmoothGrad mechanism has been used to provide decision explainability. The proposed methodology has been validated with a set of experiments on three multi-class deep learning classifiers and three well-known image datasets, MNIST, FER, and CIFAR-10.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an extensive study investigating the opinions on Artificial Intelligence (AI) of a sample of 4,006 European citizens from eight distinct countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). The aim of the study is to gain a better understanding of peopleâs views and perceptions within the European context, which is already marked by important policy actions and regulatory processes. To survey the perceptions of the citizens of Europe, we design and validate a new questionnaire (PAICE) structured around three dimensions: peopleâs awareness, attitude, and trust. We observe that while awareness is characterized by a low level of self-assessed competency, the attitude toward AI is very positive for more than half of the population. Reflecting on the collected results, we highlight implicit contradictions and identify trends that may interfere with the creation of an ecosystem of trust and the development of inclusive AI pol...",

    "abstract": "The evolution of consumer electronics is increasingly driven by advancements in industrial automation, where generative artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role, particularly in intent-based systems. This study presents a comprehensive framework for integrating generative AI into intent-based industrial automation, which aims to align high-level business goals with precise operational tasks on the factory floor. The proposed architecture synergistically combines three main components: Business Intents, the Intent Layer and the Factory Floor Shop. This framework leverages foundation models such as the most prominent large language models (LLMs) and advanced communication technologies to translate strategic business intents â such as cost optimization, order management and market adaptation â into actionable tasks to improve operational efficiency, responsiveness and strategic alignment. We also propose a process of fine-tuning LLMs to optimize their interaction flow within the intent-based system, highlighting the augmentation techniques employed to adapt LLMs for industrial contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show percentage improvements compared to pre-trained LLM models.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of social media, the strategic use of hashtags has emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing content discoverability and engagement. This research introduces the neurosymbolic contrastive framework (NSCF), an innovative methodology designed to address the multifaceted challenges inherent in automated hashtag recommendation, such as the integration of multimodal data, the context sensitivity of content, and the dynamic nature of social media trends. By combining deep learningâs representational strengths with the deductive prowess of symbolic artificial Intelligence (AI), NSCF crafts contextually relevant and logically coherent hashtag suggestions. Its dual-stream architecture meticulously processes and aligns textual and visual content through contrastive learning, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of multimodal social media data. The frameworkâs neurosymbolic integration leverages structured knowledge and logical inference, significantly enhancing the relevance and coherence of its recommendations. Evaluated against a variety of datasets, including MM-INS, NUS-WIDE, and HARRISON, NSCF has demonstrated exceptional performance, outshining existing models and baseline methods across key metrics such as precision (0.721â0.701), recall (0.736â0.716), and F1 score (0.728â0.708). This research represents a major advancement in social media analytics as it not only demonstrates NSCFâs novel approach but also sheds light on its potential to transform hashtag recommendation systems.",

    "abstract": "Radio map is an efficient demonstration for visually displaying the wireless signal coverage within a certain region. It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios. We introduce the parameters and settings for the SpectrumNet dataset generation, and evaluate four baseline methods for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset. Experiments show the necessity of the SpectrumNet dataset for training models with strong generalization in spacial, frequency, and terrain scenario domains. Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset are also discussed, including the dataset expansion and calibration, as well as the extended studies on generative models for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset.",

Each level presents challenges in the form of obstacles and diamonds arranged in different configurations that forces the agents to cooperate. In this paper, we describe the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) agents, that participated in the 2023 Geometry Friends AI Competition with excellent results, especially in the Collaborative track. Our approach combines level analysis, motion simulation, abstract planning, scripted actions, reinforcement learning and different types of agent interaction.

    "abstract": "With the significant advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) and the proliferation of mobile devices, providing high-quality AIGC services via wireless networks is becoming the future direction. However, the primary challenges of AIGC services provisioning in wireless networks lie in unstable channels, limited bandwidth resources, and unevenly distributed computational resources. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom)-empowered AIGC (SemAIGC) generation and transmission framework, where only semantic information of the content rather than all the binary bits should be generated and transmitted by using SemCom. Specifically, SemAIGC integrates diffusion models within the semantic encoder and decoder to design a workload-adjustable transceiver thereby allowing adjustment of computational resource utilization in edge and local. In addition, a resource-aware workload trade-off (ROOT) scheme is devised to intelligently make workload adaptation decisions for the transceiver, thus efficiently generating, transmitting, and fine-tuning content as per dynamic wireless channel conditions and service requirements. Simulations verify the superiority of our proposed SemAIGC framework in terms of latency and content quality compared to conventional approaches.",

    "abstract": "Containerized edge computing emerged as a preferred platform for latency-sensitive applications requiring informed and efficient decision-making accounting for the end user and edge service providersâ interests simultaneously. Edge decision engines exploit pipelined knowledge streams to enhance performance and often fall short by employing inferior resource predictors subjected to limited available training data. These shortcomings flow through the pipelines and adversely impact other modules, including schedulers leading to such decisions costing delays, user-experienced accuracy, Service Level Agreements (SLA) violations, and server faults. To address limited data, substandard CPU usage predictions, and container orchestration considering delay accuracy and SLA violations, we propose a threefold GAIKube framework offering Generative AI (GAI)-enabled proactive container orchestration for a heterogeneous edge computing paradigm. Addressing data limitation, GAIKube employs DoppelGANger (DGAN) to augment time series CPU usage data for a computationally heterogeneous edge cluster. In the second place, GAIKube leverages Google TimesFM for its long horizon predictions, 4.84 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and 3.10 Mean Absolute Error (MAE) against veterans Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) on concatenated DGAN and original dataset. Considering TimesFM quality predictions utilizing the DGAN extended dataset, GAIKube pipelines CPU usage predictions of edge servers to a proposed dynamic container orchestrator. GAIKube orchestrator produces container scheduling, migration, dynamic vertical scaling, and hosted application model-switching to balance contrasting SLA violations, cost, and accuracy objectives avoiding server faults. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) based real testbed experiments show that the GAIKube orchestrator offers 3.43% SLA violations and 3.80% user-experienced accuracy loss with zero server faults at 1.46 CPU cores expense in comp...",

This paper reviews these advanced packaging technologies and emphasizes critical design considerations for high-bandwidth chiplet interconnects, which are vital for efficient integration. We address challenges related to bandwidth density, energy efficiency, electromigration, power integrity, and signal integrity. To avoid power overhead, the chiplet interconnect architecture is designed to be as simple as possible, employing a parallel data bus with forwarded clocks. However, achieving high-yield manufacturing and robust performance still necessitates significant efforts in design and technology co-optimization. Despite these challenges, the semiconductor industry is poised for continued growth and innovation, driven by the possibilities unlocked by a robust chiplet ecosystem and novel 3D-IC design methodologies.",

    "abstract": "The demand for sustainable transformer insulation solutions has driven the investigation of natural ester oils as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional mineral oils (MO). This study evaluates the dielectric performance of palm oil (PO) and rice bran oil (RBO), focusing on their viability as insulating fluids. Comprehensive statistical analysis, powered by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithm, was conducted on breakdown voltage (BDV) data obtained under controlled conditions. RBO demonstrated superior insulating properties with an average BDV of 88.06 kV, surpassing MO by 29%, while blends such as 0.5PO/0.5RBO achieved a balanced performance of 72.80 kV. These findings highlighted the potential of RBO and its blend with PO as sustainable, high-performance alternative to hydrocarbon-based insulating fluids. This research supports the integration of natural ester oils into transformer designs, paving the way for eco-friendly and reliable power systems.",

    "abstract": "With previously unattainable performance metrics like terabit-per-second data rates, extremely low latency, and ubiquitous coverage, the next sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication technology promises to transform connectivity completely. This study highlights the major developments, difficulties, and potential uses of 6G while summarizing the state of research and development at the moment. The core technological foundations of 6G have been investigated, including terahertz (THz) frequency bands, in-band full duplex (IBFD) communication, and AI/ML-driven network optimization. Additionally, it has been implied that 6G has the ability to facilitate transformational applications such as body area networks, extended reality (XR), collaborating robotics (Cobots), smart grid 2.0, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent healthcare systems. etc. Major challenges, including ultra-dense networking, spectrum allotment, security, and privacy, are evaluated severely. The purpose of this paper is to guide future research and build a greater understanding of the revolutionary potential of 6G technology to restructure global communication networks by providing an overview of 6G research and development.",

    "abstract": "Research in the field of automated vehicles, or more generally cognitive cyber-physical systems that operate in the real world, is leading to increasingly complex systems. Among other things, artificial intelligence enables an ever-increasing degree of autonomy. In this context, the V-model, which has served for decades as a process reference model of the system development lifecycle is reaching its limits. To the contrary, innovative processes and frameworks have been developed that take into account the characteristics of emerging autonomous systems. To bridge the gap and merge the different methodologies, we present an extension of the V-model for iterative data-based development processes that harmonizes and formalizes the existing methods towards a generic framework. The iterative approach allows for seamless integration of continuous system refinement. While the data-based approach constitutes the consideration of data-based development processes and formalizes the use of synthetic and real world data. In this way, formalizing the process of development, verification, validation, and continuous integration contributes to ensuring the safety of emerging complex systems that incorporate AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) edge devices increasingly require the enhanced accuracy of floating-point (FP) multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations as well as nonvolatile on-chip memory to minimize the movement of weight data in power-off mode. Designing non-volatile compute-in-memory (nvCIM) macros for FP operations imposes several challenges, including: 1) a tradeoff between inference accuracy and weight bit-width following pre-alignment; 2) long computing latency and high energy consumption; 3) large cell array current during computation; and 4) high multi-bit readout energy consumption. In this study, we devised four schemes to address these issues, including: 1) a kernel-wise weight pre-alignment (K-WPA); 2) a rescheduled multi-bit input compression (RS-MIC); 3) HRS-favored dual-sign-bit (HF-DSB); and 4) residue-shared analog-to-digital converter (RS-ADC). A 16 Mb resistive random access memory (ReRAM) nvCIM macro fabricated for FP operations using foundry-provided ReRAM (22 nm CMOS technology) achieved an efficiency of 34.2 TFLOPS/W under BF16-input, BF16-weight, and FP32-output and 31.4 TFLOPS/W under FP16-input, FP16-weight, and FP32-output.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the fast progress of technology and the widespread availability of music streaming platforms, there is a pressing need to provide precise and reliable music recommendations for various music electronics products. To address this issue, we propose a novel AI-empowered consumer behavior modeling framework that seamlessly integrates long short-term preference-based music recommendation and heterogeneous music traffic data analysis. Our framework comprises two key components: a long short-term preference-based music recommendation model and a heterogeneous data co-clustering method. The long short-term preference-based music recommendation model captures usersâ dynamic preferences by intelligently modeling their long-term and short-term interests from their historical listening sequences. Additionally, the heterogeneous data co-clustering method analyzes the music traffic data across various music electronics products, e.g., smartphones, tablets, and wireless charging platforms. Our framework can uncover complex patterns and relationships by leveraging the rich information in the heterogeneous data, leading to more comprehensive and accurate music recommendations. The proposed model has been extensively tested on two datasets, and the experimental results illustrate the modelâs effectiveness and resilience. The model has the power to greatly improve user satisfaction and attract more customers to music electronics products.",

As a powerful computer vision and image processing tool, AI has leveraged early and accurate diagnosis of diseases facilitating early interventions of medical professionals. The Consumer Electronics (CE) in the medical arena range from smart wearable devices to sophisticated tools, that monitor medical signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), and capture radiographic images such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that act as biomarkers for medical analysis. However, with its emergence, an associated problem has also surfaced in the form of its vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work highlights different ways in which undetectable adversarial attacks pose a threat to the medical CE ecosystem. We simultaneously explore methods to mitigate the vulnerability of our medical domain against such attacks.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, training these LLMs imposes immense demands on computational power and bandwidth for hardware systems. Wafer-scale chips (WSCs) offer a promising solution, yet they struggle with limited on-chip memory and complex tensor partitioning. To fully harness the high-bandwidth, low-latency on-chip interconnect benefits of WSCs and to alleviate the on-chip memory limitations, a specialized mapping and architecture co-exploration method is essential. Despite existing efforts in memory optimization and mapping, current approaches fall short for WSC scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce TMAC, an architecture-mapping co-exploration framework that integrates recomputation into the design space, fully exploiting optimization opportunities overlooked by existing works. Further, TMAC takes advantage of the superior on-chip interconnect performance of WSCs by incorporating a more flexible tensor partition scheme. TMAC then introduces a novel operator-centric encoding scheme (OCES) designed to comprehensively describe the mapping space for training LLMs. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on communication volume analysis based on mapping, TMAC explores the design space by evaluating the combined impact of mapping and architecture on training performance. However, fully accounting for these untapped optimization opportunities increases the complexity of the design space. To address this, we streamline the simulation process, reducing the time needed for exploration. Compared to AccPar, Deepspeed and Megatron, TMAC delivers a $3.1\times$ , $2.9\times$ , $1.6\times$ performance gain. In terms of memory usage, TMAC requires $3.6\times$ , $3.1\times$ less memory than AccPar and Deepspeed, respectively and is comparable to Megatron's full recomputation method.",

    "abstract": "This article studies the generalization of neural networks (NNs) by examining how a network changes when trained on a training sample with or without out-of-distribution (OoD) examples. If the networkâs predictions are less influenced by fitting OoD examples, then the network learns attentively from the clean training set. A new notion, dataset-distraction stability , is proposed to measure the influence. Extensive CIFAR-10/100 experiments on the different VGG, ResNet, WideResNet, ViT architectures, and optimizers show a negative correlation between the dataset-distraction stability and generalizability. With the distraction stability, we decompose the learning process on the training set\nS\ninto multiple learning processes on the subsets of\nS\ndrawn from simpler distributions, i.e., distributions of smaller intrinsic dimensions (IDs), and furthermore, a tighter generalization bound is derived. Through attentive learning, miraculous generalization in deep learning can be explained and novel algorithms can also be designed.",

    "abstract": "In scenarios involving robots generating and executing plans, conflicts can arise between cost-effective robot execution and meeting human expectations for safe behavior. When humans supervise robots, their accountability increases, especially when robot behavior deviates from expectations. To address this, robots may choose a highly constrained plan when monitored and a more optimal one when unobserved. While this behavior is not driven by human-like motives, it stems from robots accommodating diverse supervisors. To optimize monitoring costs while ensuring safety, we model this interaction in a trust-based game-theoretic framework. However, pure-strategy Nash equilibrium often fails to exist in this model. To address this, we introduce the concept of a trust boundary within the mixed strategy space, aiding in the discovery of optimal monitoring strategies. Human studies demonstrate the necessity of optimal strategies and the benefits of our suggested approaches.",

    "abstract": "Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. SG2 is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2âs stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning online video game industry has sparked intense competition among providers to both expand their user base and retain existing players, particularly within social interaction genres. To anticipate player churn, there is an increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models that focus on social interaction dynamics. However, the prevalent opacity of most ML algorithms poses a significant hurdle to their acceptance among domain experts, who often view them as âblack boxesâ. Despite the availability of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques capable of elucidating model decisions, their adoption in the gaming industry remains limited. This is primarily because non-technical domain experts, such as product managers and game designers, encounter substantial challenges in deciphering the âexplicitâ and âimplicitâ features embedded within computational models. This study proposes a reliable, interpretable, and actionable solution for predicting player churn by restructuring model inputs into explicit and implicit features. It explores how establishing a connection between explicit and implicit features can assist experts in understanding the underlying implicit features. Moreover, it emphasizes the necessity for XAI techniques that not only offer implementable interventions but also pinpoint the most crucial features for those interventions. Two case studies, including expert feedback and a within-subject user study, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a rapidly burgeoning field demonstrating significant potential in creating diverse content intelligently and automatically. To support such artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) services, future communication systems must fulfill stringent requirements, including high data rates, throughput, and low latency, while efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SemCom) has been deemed as a revolutionary communication scheme to tackle this challenge by conveying the meaning of messages instead of bit reproduction. GAI algorithms serve as the foundation for enabling intelligent and efficient SemCom systems in terms of model pre-training and fine-tuning, knowledge base construction, and resource allocation. Conversely, SemCom can provide AIGC services with low latency and high reliability due to its ability to perform semantic-aware encoding and compression of data, as well as knowledge-and context-based reasoning. In this survey, we break new ground by investigating the architecture, wireless communication schemes, and network management of GAI-driven SemCom networks. We first introduce a novel architecture for GAI-driven SemCom networks, comprising the data plane, physical infrastructure, and network control plane. In turn, we provide an in-depth analysis of the transceiver design and semantic effectiveness calculation of end-to-end GAI-driven SemCom systems. Subsequently, we present innovative generation level and knowledge management strategies in the proposed networks, including knowledge construction, update, and sharing, ensuring accurate and timely knowledge-based reasoning. Finally, we explore several promising use cases, i.e., autonomous driving, smart cities, and the Metaverse, to provide a comprehensive understanding and future direction of GAI-driven SemCom networks.",

    "abstract": "In modern power systems with increasing renewable energy integration, accurate estimation of time-varying inertia is critical for ensuring grid stability and resilience. This paper proposes an innovative ensemble of dual-stage hybrid deep learning methods that leverage the strengths of different hybrid networks. The goal is to provide computationally efficient, accurate, and robust inertia estimation in real-time under ambient, dynamic, and challenging operating conditions. The ensemble model comprises a fusion of hybrids of long short-term memory and multilayer perceptron (LSTM-MLP), convolutional-LSTM (ConvLSTM), and temporal convolutional network-LSTM (TCN-LSTM). First, the proposed model is trained and evaluated against cutting-edge methods, using a modified IEEE 39-bus system's data comprising electric power (PE), photovoltaic (PV) power, mechanical power (PM), and rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF). The results showcase the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the proposed method achieves 0.027411, outperforming the above individual methods in inertia prediction by 21.86%, 61.81%, 46.03% respectively. Second, we evaluate the model resilience to unavailability of individual input variables and noise in input variables, achieving low average RMSE values of 0.068782 and 0.044712, respectively, for PM and PE inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates effective generalization in estimating inertia on new data with entirely different distributions from training data. The results also highlight high sensitivity of RoCoF and PV input to noise, thus providing valuable insights for optimizing model performance in real-world applications. Finally, the approach is further validated on a modified IEEE 68-bus system, achieving significant accuracy and robustness, highlighting its capability to handle larger systems and enhancing its practical applicability.",

Nowadays, many studies have developed algorithms for this purpose. However, they often struggle with an issue that is the noise in physiological signals from various devices. This makes current methods have low robustness when performing speech generation. To this end, we propose a framework to robustly producing imagined speech for patients with language impairments. It is based on artificial intelligent-generated content (AIGC). In specific, this work develops a diffusion model to remove noise from brain signals, which are then converted and normalized into log-mel spectrograms. Next, the product feeds into a transformer-based model to extract local and global features. Finally, these enhanced features are inputted into full connected layers to generate the imagined speech. The effectiveness of our model is validated using the high-quality, i.e., single-word-production-Dutch-iBIDS dataset. It achieves Pearson correlation scores above 0.8 and standard deviations below 0.2 across different volunteers. Experimental results well demonstrate that our model is robust and has advantages over peer methods.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel integer-floating-point (INT-FP) gain-cell (GC)-computing-in-memory (CIM) structure for high-precision multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with high computational flexibility, energy efficiency, and inference accuracy. The proposed device employs: 1) a dual-mode zone-based input processing scheme (ZB-IPS) aimed at eliminating exponent subtraction in order to enhance energy and area efficiency (AEF); 2) a dual-mode local computing cell (DM-LCC) to reuse exponent addition as an adder tree stage for INT-MAC to enhance AEF in both INT and floating-point (FP) modes; and 3) a stationary-based two-port GC array (SB-TP-GCA) to enable concurrent data updates and computation while reducing system-to-CIM and internal data accesses to improve energy efficiency. A 16-nm FinFET 108-kb GC-CIM macro fabricated using 4T gain cells (GCs) achieved energy efficiency of 99.5 TOPS/W in INT-MAC operations involving 128 accumulations of 8b-input, 8b-weight, and 23b-output; and 46.4 TFLOPS/W in FP-MAC operations involving 64 accumulations of BF16-input, BF16-weight, and FP32-output.",

    "abstract": "Deploying intelligent service and executing inference tasks in the proximity of the edge enable models to access enormous real-time data generated by the edge devices. However, the dilemma of fulfilling service demands with limited resources at edge devices impairs the efficacy of conventional data-oriented communication systems. To achieve a better trade-off between inference accuracy and communication overhead, in this paper, we propose a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative edge inference system, where a UAV acts as an edge server to aggregate the wide-view features from mobile sensors through Over-the-Air computation (AirComp) to complete the inference task cooperatively. Discriminant gain, an effective indicator for the inference accuracy, is adopted to realize task-oriented design. To exploit channel diversity and data diversity in the multi-device cooperative edge inference system, we maximize the discriminant gain of the AirComp feature aggregation by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and the power allocation policy with respect to the different important levels of feature dimensions. An alternating algorithm and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method are then proposed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical simulations further validate the efficacy of the proposed design compared to the baselines.",

    "abstract": "With evolving technologies, changing requirements, and limited budgets, governments and industries need to consider new methodologies to help streamline program lifecycle management, from cradle to grave, to ensure projects are delivered on time, on budget, and to the expected performance standards. Traditional approaches fail to adequately address the added complexities of System of Systems programs such as integration, interoperability, and variable lifecycle of subcomponents. The objective of this study is to assess and address the research question - can a new acquisition approach be designed to address and improve program lifecycle management of complex systems? A comparison study, using the Modified Delphi Method, of this new approach to the traditional legacy systems engineering approaches of the Agile Framework, Evolutionary Acquisition, and Modular Open Systems Approach was conducted to validate the conceptual framework. The Genetic Acquisition strategy establishes an improved methodology to embrace uncertainty while focusing not only on the quantitative technology deployment but also the system's qualitative user adoption, thereby reducing risk to achieve cost, schedule, and performance objectives of a complex program. This ensures that any implemented technology remains âbest-in-classâ throughout the lifecycle of a program to address the gaps and historical failures identified through qualitative research.",

    "abstract": "Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) enabled Internet of Things (IoT) extends connectivity to remote and underserved areas, enhances network reliability and coverage, and supports diverse IoT applications in challenging environments such as rural, maritime, and disaster-stricken regions. As an emerging and fast-evolving IoT scheme, NTN-enabled IoT requires extensive evaluation to ensure effective deployment in real-world scenarios, such as connectivity, performance, and security evaluation. Since conducting testing in remote and diverse environments is logistically challenging and costly, we propose a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based synthetic traffic generation framework that facilitates comprehensive traffic analysis and performance evaluation. The proposed framework employs a GAI model to learn the traffic pattern and generate synthetic traffic from historical data. Our approach includes an embedding-based model for representing network flow attributes and a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for generating traffic flows. Considering both source-destination information and statistical features achieves more comprehensive characterization of traffic flows. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate high quality traffic that conforms to real data distribution and shows obvious difference between multiple applications.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning has evolved significantly over the last decade, with models capable of robust and accurate predictions over data of various categories. The impact is rather big in the field of Healthcare. However, deployment of small, energy-efficient models remains a goal pursued by researchers across the field. Futhermore, the model inferences are hard to interpret and draw conclusions from, especially in healthcare, where its very important to know how the diagnosis decision was passed and what factors are causing the issues. In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings, where we develop a neuromorphic computing based machine learning model, namely an SNN, and using SHAP, LIME, and eli5 explainability techniques to explain the predictions of the Spiking Neural Network. The proposed SNN performs at an accuracy of 85.06%, better than the deep neural network by 5.73% for the Diabetes dataset and at an accuracy of 97.83% for the Mobile Health dataset, thereby mitigating the issue of both lack of performance-cum-efficiency, as well as uninterpretability of these machine learning models.",

    "abstract": "Standardised functional tests (SFTs) are frequently used to quantify a personâs ability to perform activities of daily living against expected values. SFTs provide valuable information to aid a clinicianâs understanding of a patientâs status and direction of improvement. Such information may support clinicians when assessing a wide range of conditions such as musculoskeletal or neurological diseases or age-related frailty. If these SFTs could be performed reliably by patients in their own home without supervision they could track and help to guide rehabilitation. Wearable devices have the potential to collect reliable data from the wearer when performing SFTs. However, the data generated from sensors for long-term recordings of movement can become very large, making it difficult to manually extract movement information with any level of accuracy. Hence, it is important to evaluate whether it is possible to implement an automated system capable of extracting SFT patterns from long-term sensor data without manual data processing. This paper describes an Artificial Neural Network system that was trained to extract specific SFTs such as the 30-second Chair Stand Test (30s-CST) and the 40-meter Fast-Paced Walk Test (40m-FPWT). The resultant model obtained 99.7% accuracy in 30s-CST pattern recognition, 99.3% accuracy in 40m-FPWT pattern recognition, and 97.3% accuracy in detecting false patterns. The system provided an overall accuracy of 98.76% with supervised clinical trial data. The ambulatory data testing phase obtained an overall accuracy of 90.18%. Specifically, it achieved 92.73% accuracy in detecting 30s-CST patterns and 86.67% accuracy in recognising 40m-FPWT patterns.",

    "abstract": "Bees play a crucial role in human food production and ecosystem maintenance. However, they face a global crisis characterized by significant population decline, including colony collapse disorder, which threatens their survival. Therefore, the development of precision beekeeping IoT systems is pivotal for enhancing bee colony strength. This study analyzes and categorizes the research focusing on the colony strength into two main areas based on colony activity and threat detection. Research on colony activity aids beekeepers to effectively manage their hives by analyzing behaviors, such as internal status, swarming, and traffic. In threat detection, research focuses on identifying critical predators, such as hornets and varroa destructor that significantly affect colony survival. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review, thoroughly presenting findings on the evolution and diversification of methodologies aimed at enhancing colony strength. By delving into various innovative approaches and assessing their effectiveness, this review highlights key developments that have significantly contributed to improving the resilience of bee populations against emerging threats. Furthermore, this study identifies the limitations of current research and proposes future research directions focused on enhancing the accuracy of bee behavior analysis and threat detection to improve colony strength and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Channel estimation becomes challenging in near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, since the channel sparsity in the angular domain is destroyed. To avoid designing a near-field sparse dictionary and the estimation errors caused by sparse transformation, in this letter, we formulate the wideband near-field channel estimation problem as an image super-resolution (SR) problem, and propose a model-driven iterative SR channel estimate network (MDISR-Net) based on the Bayesian principle. Specifically, each layer of MDISR-Net is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a gradient descent network, which are corresponding to the prior sub-problem and channel sub-problem. Stack of multiple layers enables channel estimation to be resolved iteratively by solving two sub-problems. Our proposed scheme does not require a sparse dictionary and hence avoid the estimation errors caused by sparse transformation. The numerical results demonstrate that MDISR-Net significantly improves channel estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning (SDL) methodology holds promise for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (AMRI) but is hampered by the reliance on extensive training data. Some self-supervised frameworks, such as deep image prior (DIP), have emerged, eliminating the explicit training procedure but often struggling to remove noise and artifacts under significant degradation. This work introduces a novel self-supervised accelerated parallel MRI approach called PEARL, leveraging a multiple-stream joint deep decoder with two cross-fusion schemes to accurately reconstruct one or more target images from compressively sampled k-space. Each stream comprises cascaded cross-fusion sub-block networks (SBNs) that sequentially perform combined upsampling, 2D convolution, joint attention, ReLU activation and batch normalization (BN). Among them, combined upsampling and joint attention facilitate mutual learning between multiple-stream networks by integrating multi-parameter priors in both additive and multiplicative manners. Long-range unified skip connections within SBNs ensure effective information propagation between distant cross-fusion layers. Additionally, incorporating dual-normalized edge-orientation similarity regularization into the training loss enhances detail reconstruction and prevents overfitting. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that PEARL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised AMRI technologies in various MRI cases. Notably, 5-fold $\\sim$ 6-fold accelerated acquisition yields a 1 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 2 $\\%$ improvement in SSIM $_{ROI}$ and a 3 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 6 $\\%$ improvement in PSNR $_{ROI}$ , along with a significant 15 $\\%$ $\\sim$ 20 $\\%$ reduction in RLNE $_{ROI}$ .",

    "abstract": "Geometry plays a significant role in monocular 3D object detection. It can be used to estimate object depth by using the perspective projection between object's physical size and 2D projection in the image plane, which can introduce mathematical priors into deep models. However, this projection process also introduces error amplification, where the error of the estimated height is amplified and reflected into the projected depth. It leads to unreliable depth inferences and also impairs training stability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Geometry Uncertainty Propagation Network (GUPNet++) by modeling geometry projection in a probabilistic manner. This ensures depth predictions are well-bounded and associated with a reasonable uncertainty. The significance of introducing such geometric uncertainty is twofold: (1). It models the uncertainty propagation relationship of the geometry projection during training, improving the stability and efficiency of the end-to-end model learning. (2). It can be derived to a highly reliable confidence to indicate the quality of the 3D detection result, enabling more reliable detection inference. Experiments show that the proposed approach not only obtains (state-of-the-art) SOTA performance in image-based monocular 3D detection but also demonstrates superiority in efficacy with a simplified framework",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning (URL) that learns compact embeddings of high-dimensional data without supervision has achieved remarkable progress recently. However, the development of URLs for different requirements is independent, which limits the generalization of the algorithms, especially prohibitive as the number of tasks grows. For example, dimension reduction (DR) methods, t-SNE and UMAP, optimize pairwise data relationships by preserving the global geometric structure, while self-supervised learning, SimCLR and BYOL, focuses on mining the local statistics of instances under specific augmentations. To address this dilemma, we summarize and propose a unified similarity-based URL framework, GenURL, which can adapt to various URL tasks smoothly. In this article, we regard URL tasks as different implicit constraints on the data geometric structure that help to seek optimal low-dimensional representations that boil down to data structural modeling (DSM) and low-dimensional transformation (LDT). Specifically, DSM provides a structure-based submodule to describe the global structures, and LDT learns compact low-dimensional embeddings with given pretext tasks. Moreover, an objective function, general KullbackâLeibler (GKL) divergence, is proposed to connect DSM and LDT naturally. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GenURL achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised visual learning, unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD), graph embeddings (GEs), and DR.",

    "abstract": "In the two-stage architecture of 48 V data center power systems, the front-end intermediate bus converter (IBC) needs to adapt to both 48 V nominal input voltage and a wide input voltage range of the backup battery (typically 40 Vâ60 V). To cope with this design challenge, we propose a phase shift regulated resonant switched-capacitor-based IBC. At nominal input, it achieves a 4 n :1 voltage conversion ratio with an n :1 transformer, and the electrical stresses on primary switches are significantly reduced. Furthermore, zero voltage switching (ZVS) does not rely on the transformerâs magnetizing current. Therefore, the magnetizing current can be suppressed to optimize the efficiency. When the backup battery is linked, a phase shift is introduced between the stacked bridges to regulate the wide input voltage. Theoretical analysis and design considerations are provided to showcase the advantages of the proposed concept. A hardware prototype operated at 1 MHz, converting 40 Vâ60 V input to stable 12 V and maximum 20 A output, is designed and tested. Experimental results well validate its exceptional soft-switching and voltage regulation performances. The peak efficiency reaches 97.12% at 48 V input and 12V/7 A output.",

    "abstract": "Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) is an important performance indicator in the field of multi-objective optimization (MOO). Although it has been widely used for decades, applying IGD for fair and accurate performance evaluation remains challenging, with the biggest obstacle being the selection of the reference set. IGD generally represents the distance between the solution set and the Pareto front (PF). Since the real PF is often an infinite set, even if it is known, it is difficult to apply it directly to the calculation of IGD. As a workaround, past research typically samples a finite set, i.e., the reference set, from the PF as an approximation, indirectly used in the IGD calculation. This inevitably introduces a systematic error, which we refer to as discretization error. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for the discretization error, demonstrating that if the reference set is sufficiently dense and uniformly distributed on the entire PF, the discretization error will converge to zero. Additionally, we propose a numerical method for the exact calculation of IGD and IGD+. When the analytical expression of the PF is known, this method allows for the direct calculation of IGD and IGD+ using the real PF, thus avoiding discretization error.",

This design reconciles the inherent challenges faced by conventional worm-like and wheeled robots. Our robot showcases two locomotion modes and five distinct motion types: worm-like rectilinear, sidewinding, circular crawling, rectilinear rolling, and spot turning. This versatility enables the robot to adapt to diverse environments and tasks. We have developed kinematic models for both crawling and rolling locomotion modes. By correlating these models with gait and control signals, we can qualitatively predict the characteristics of robot trajectories and locomotion performance indexes, underscoring the key role of kinematic models in locomotion. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the robot's multiterrain adaptability. The robot adeptly navigates horizontal, curved, and vertical industrial pipes, along with narrow sewers, utilizing the worm-like crawling mode. Moreover, it efficiently traverses open terrains, including carpeted floors, mossy ground, gravel paths, grassland, steps, asphalt pavement, and uphill, employing the rolling mode. Impressively, the robot swiftly readjusts its posture after descending steps and promptly reorients itself through spot turns, showcasing its agility. This work highlights the advantages of combining multiple motion modalities and integrating structural and control signals, providing valuable insights for the advancement of future bionic and multimodal robots.",

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task aiming to recognize anomalies in video frames, and existing large-scale VAD researches primarily focus on road traffic and human activity scenes. In industrial scenes, there are often a variety of unpredictable anomalies, and the VAD method can play a significant role in these scenarios. However, there is a lack of applicable datasets and methods specifically tailored for industrial production scenarios due to concerns regarding privacy and security. To bridge this gap, we propose a new dataset, IPAD, specifically designed for VAD in industrial scenarios. The industrial processes in our dataset are chosen through on-site factory research and discussions with engineers. This dataset covers 16 different industrial devices and contains over 6 hours of both synthetic and real-world video footage. Moreover, we annotate the key feature of the industrial process, i.e ., periodicity. Based on the proposed dataset, we introduce a period memory module and a sliding window inspection mechanism to effectively investigate the periodic information in a basic reconstruction model. Our framework leverages LoRA adapter to explore the effective migration of pretrained models, which are initially trained using synthetic data, into real-world scenarios. Our proposed dataset and method will fill the gap in the field of industrial video anomaly detection and drive the process of video understanding tasks as well as smart factory deployment.

    "abstract": "Affective music generation is a challenge for symbolic music generation. Existing methods face the problem that the perceived emotion of the generated music is not evident because music datasets containing emotional labels are relatively small in quantity and scale. To address this issue, an attribute-enhanced affective music transformer (AE-AMT) model is proposed to generate perceived affective music with attribute enhancement. In addition, a multiquantile-based attribute discretization (MQAD) strategy is designed, enabling the model to generate intensity-controllable affective music pieces. Furthermore, A replication-expanded compound representation of the control signals (RECR) method is designed for control signals to improve the controllability of the model. In objective experiments, the AE-AMT model demonstrated a 29.25% and 19.5% improvement in overall emotion accuracy, along with a 30% and 32% improvement in arousal accuracy on the datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI. These improvements are achieved without significant difference in objective music quality, while also providing ample novelty and diversity compared to the current state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, subjective experiments revealed that the AE-AMT model outperformed comparison models, especially in low valence and arousal based on the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Additionally, the soft variant model of AE-AMT exhibited a significant advantage in valence, low arousal, and overall music quality. These experiments showcase the AE-AMT modelâs ability to significantly enhance arousal performance and strike a balance between emotional intensity and musical quality through adaptable strategies.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modality fusion strategy is currently the de-facto most competitive solution for 3D perception tasks. In this work, we present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations from multi-modality data with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, we design spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from both point cloud and camera input, thus completing multi-modality information fusion under BEV space. For temporal information, we propose temporal self-attention to fuse the history BEV information recurrently. By comparing with other fusion paradigms, we demonstrate that the fusion method proposed in this work is both succinct and effective. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art 74.1% in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes test set. In addition, we extend BEVFormer to encompass a wide range of autonomous driving tasks, including object tracking, vectorized mapping, occupancy prediction, and end-to-end autonomous driving, achieving outstanding results across these tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/fundamentalvision/BEVFormer .",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for graph classification tasks. However, contemporary graph classification methods are predominantly studied in fully supervised scenarios, while there could be label ambiguity and noise in real-world applications. In this work, we explore the weakly supervised problem of partial label learning on graphs, where each graph sample is assigned a collection of candidate labels. A novel method called D istribution Div e rgence-bas e d Graph Cont r ast (DEER) is proposed to address this issue. At the heart of our DEER is to measure the divergence among the underlying semantic distributions in the hidden space and this metric enables the identification of accurate positive graph pairs for effective graph contrastive learning. Specifically, we generate graph representations of augmented graph views that retain semantics and can be regarded as samples from the underlying semantic distributions. We employ a non-parametric metric to measure distribution divergence, which is then combined with pseudo-labeling to generate unbiased and target-oriented graph pairs. Furthermore, we introduce a label-correction method to eliminate noisy candidate labels, updating target labels using posterior distributions in a soft manner. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DEER in different settings compared to a range of state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "It is always well believed that pre-trained vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) would substantially facilitate vision-language tasks. Nevertheless, there has been less evidence in support of the idea on describing novel objects in images. In this paper, we propose the Novel Object Transformer with CLIP (NOTC), a Transformer-based model that innovatively exploits the powerful vision-language representation ability of CLIP to enhance novel object captioning modelâs training and sentence decoding processes. Technically, given the primary bag-of-objects extracted by Faster R-CNN, NOTC first capitalize on an object distiller module to emphasize the most salient objects and infer the missing novel ones. The refined object words are additionally fed into the object-centric word predictor to generate sentence word-by-word. During training, we design a CLIP-based self-critical sequence training paradigm to select visually-grounded sampled sentence with higher CLIP score reward, which enables a joint training process of captioning model over out-domain training images with novel objects. Moreover, at inference, a new CLIP beam search algorithm is devised to enforce the existence of novel objects and encourage the partial word sequences with higher CLIP scores, thereby decoding both visually-grounded and comprehensive sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted on held-out COCO and nocaps datasets, and competitive performances are reported when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting nearby agents' future trajectories is fundamental for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. However, existing learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes, potentially leading to failed predictions in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce IMGTP, a unified framework for systematically evaluating, improving, and measuring the generalization performance of trajectory prediction models in OOD scenes. IMGTP consists of three primary components: the Argoverse-Shift dataset, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy, and an approach for OOD measurement. First, the Argoverse-Shift is a cross-domain dataset that highlights the significant differences in data distributions across domains, serving as a testing platform for models' generalization ability. Second, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy leverages map centerlines and the FrenÃÂ©t Frame to enhance the generalizability of baseline models by mitigating the domain gap resulting from road geometry variations. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology for OOD measurement, quantifying the range of data that can be effectively handled by prediction models. This measurement approach employs the accuracy rate of the correctly predicted samples and their corresponding mean distance as well as standard deviation to the training set center as indicators of the model's generalization ability. The mean distance also serves as a valid criterion for OOD detection and uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that our IMGTP framework enhances the generalization capability of mainstream trajectory prediction models by substantially improving their prediction performance in unseen domains. This advancement contributes to developing more robust and safer prediction models for autonomous driving in the real world.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing real-world 3D objects has numerous applications in computer vision, such as virtual reality, video games, and animations. Ideally, 3D reconstruction methods should generate high-fidelity results with 3D consistency in real-time. Traditional methods match pixels between images using photo-consistency constraints or learned features, while differentiable rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) use differentiable volume rendering or surface-based representation to generate high-fidelity scenes. However, these methods require excessive runtime for rendering, making them impractical for daily applications. To address these challenges, we present EvaSurf , an E fficient V iew- A ware implicit textured Surf ace reconstruction method on mobile devices. In our method, we first employ an efficient surface-based model with a multi-view supervision module to ensure accurate mesh reconstruction. To enable high-fidelity rendering, we learn an implicit texture embedded with view-aware encoding to capture view-dependent information. Furthermore, with the explicit geometry and the implicit texture, we can employ a lightweight neural shader to reduce the expense of computation and further support real-time rendering on common mobile devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-quality appearance and accurate mesh on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Moreover, our method can be trained in just 1-2 hours using a single GPU and run on mobile devices at over 40 FPS (Frames Per Second), with a final package required for rendering taking up only 40-50 MB.",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and tasks, they still struggle with multimodal tasks, particularly the Spoken Question Answering (SQA) task, which requires precise alignment and deep interaction between speech and text. In this paper, we address the SQA challenge by curating a novel freeform and open-ended SQA dataset, LibriSQA, which is composed of 214k SQA pairs covering a wide range of topics. It consists of two parts. Part I is designed for natural conversational formats and Part II focuses on multiple-choice questions with answers and analytical segments. Considering the limited availability of speech-text LLMs, we propose a lightweight, end-to-end framework to perform the SQA task on the LibriSQA dataset, achieving significant results. By transforming Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into the SQA format, we further demonstrate the frameworkâs capability in handling ASR tasks. Our empirical findings support the i...",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting is a phenomenon in which a neural network, upon learning a new task, struggles to maintain its performance on previously learned tasks. It is a common challenge in the realm of continual learning (CL) through neural networks. The mammalian brain addresses catastrophic forgetting by consolidating memories in different parts of the brain, involving the hippocampus and the neocortex. Taking inspiration from this brain strategy, we present a CL framework that combines a plastic model simulating the fast learning capabilities of the hippocampus and a stable model representing the slow consolidation nature of the neocortex. To supplement this, we introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based pseudo memory for rehearsal purposes. In addition by applying lateral inhibition masks on the gradients of the convolutional layer, we aim at damping the activity of adjacent neurons and introduce a sleep phase to reorganize the learned representations. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the positive impact of such additions on the performance of our proposed framework; we evaluate the proposed model on several class-incremental and domain-incremental datasets and compare it with the standard benchmark algorithms, showing significant improvements. With the aim to showcase practical applicability, we implement the algorithm in a physical environment for object classification using a soft pneumatic gripper. The algorithm learns new classes incrementally in real time and also exhibits significant backward knowledge transfer (KT).",

    "abstract": "Herb-target interactions (HTIs) are pivotal for unveiling the underlying pharmacological mechanisms between herbs and biological targets (e.g., proteins and nucleic acids). Unlike typical drugs, each of which is made of one pharmacological compound, the herb is composed of different pharmacological ingredients, while contemporary computational approaches mainly focus on HTIs, neglecting the more refined and informative ingredient-target interactions (ITIs). Furthermore, those methods also disregard the complex associations between herbs and ingredients, which have multi-granular interactions with targets. We propose a multi-instance learning based solution (HTI-MIL) to identify HTIs and the finer ITIs. Particularly, HTI-MIL employs Autoencoder, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Graph Convolution Networks to learn representations of herbs, targets, and ingredients, respectively. Next, it takes herbs as bags and ingredients as instances to model the interplay between herbs and ingredien...",

However, most existing studies can only learn codes for a given size and rate, typically defined by a fixed network architecture and a set of parameters. The support of multiple code rates is essential for conserving bandwidth under varying channel conditions while it is costly to store multiple AI models or parameter sets. In this article, we propose an auto-encoder (AE) based rate-compatible linear block codes (RC-LBCs). The coding process associated with AI or non-AI decoders and multiple puncturing patterns is optimized in a data-driven manner.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly faced with significant challenges and opportunities, particularly in the realm of security for consumer electronics technology. The adversarial defense (ADV) mechanism has more potential for addressing those issues. Some pertinent AI-enabled or metaheuristic schemes, such as MOPSO, MOGWO, and NSGA-II algorithms, have proven specific advantages but are lacking in providing significant accuracy prediction and robustness. By combining AI, machine learning (ML), and metaheuristic techniques, ADV enhances the detection and mitigation of dynamic security attacks such as intrusion detection or real-time malware detection, including adversarial attacks in consumer electronics appliances. This research emphasizes the combined use of AI/ML and metaheuristic algorithms, illustrating how ADV methods can employ various techniques to safeguard AI from adversarial attacks. Through detailed simulations and comparative analyses, this research highlights the effectiveness of advanced ADV methods in strengthening the resilience of consumer-based AI systems against new threats, thereby ensuring robust protection for electronic technologies and their data.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on a public health policy-adherence assessment (PHPA) application that aims to automatically assess people's public health policy adherence during emergent global health crisis events (e.g., COVID-19, MonkeyPox) by leveraging massive public health policy adherence imagery data from the social media. In particular, we study an optimal AI model design problem in the PHPA application, where the goal is to leverage the crowdsourced human intelligence to accurately identify the optimal AI model design (i.e., network architecture and hyperparameter configuration combination) without the need of AI experts. However, two critical challenges exist in our problem: 1) it is challenging to effectively optimize the AI model design given the interdependence between network architecture and hyperparameter configuration; 2) it is non-trivial to leverage the human intelligence queried from ordinary crowd workers to identify the optimal AI model design in the PHPA application. To address these challenges, we develop CrowdDesign , a subjective logic-driven human-AI collaborative learning framework that explores the complementary strength of AI and human intelligence to jointly identify the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter configuration of an AI model in the PHPA application. The experimental results from two real-world PHPA applications demonstrate that CrowdDesign consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by achieving the best PHPA performance.",

    "abstract": "Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the air interface has been envisioned as a key technology for next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. At the air interface, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and its variants, such as multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) and massive/full-dimension MIMO, have been key enablers across successive generations of cellular networks with evolving complexity and design challenges. Initiating active investigation into leveraging AI/ML tools to address these challenges for MIMO becomes a critical step toward an AI-enabled NextG air interface. At the NextG air interface, the underlying wireless environment will be extremely dynamic with operation adaptations performed on a sub-millisecond basis by MIMO operations such as MU-MIMO scheduling and rank/link adaptation. Given the enormously large number of operation adaptation possibilities, we contend that online real-time AI/ML-based approaches constitute a promising paradigm. To this end, we outline the inherent challenges and offer insights into the design of such online real-time AI/ML-based solutions for MIMO operations. An online real-time AI/ML-based method for MIMO-OFDM channel estimation is then presented, serving as a potential roadmap for developing similar techniques across various MIMO operations in NextG.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed traditional consumer electronics (CEs) into next-generation devices with enhanced intelligence and connectivity. However, this advancement has exposed CEs to cybersecurity threats such as IoT botnets. Consequently, researchers are employing AI for proactive threat detection and prevention. Unfortunately, AI algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, necessitating robustness studies, as evaded malware can cause significant damage to already susceptible IoT CEs. This paper presents a case study to evaluate the resilience of AI-based IoT malware detection systems against adversarial attacks. Specifically, our method involves inserting crafted binary code snippets (payloads) into the empty regions of malware executables. We leverage explainable AI (XAI) techniques to guide payload generation, coupled with an optimization procedure to efficiently identify optimal payload sequences. Our method, tested on real-world IoT datasets, yields a robust hybrid detection system with a detection rate of up to 99.11%. Our attack approach achieves evasion rates of up to 100% and generates transferable adversarial examples. The generated samples evade a prominent structural IoT malware detector with an evasion rate of 95.15% at a minimal attack cost. This study underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness of AI-based malware detection systems and implementing diverse strategies to safeguard consumer IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) is a key pillar of 6G networks. It allows the 6G management and orchestration framework to operate the networks without external (e.g., human) intervention. To effectively achieve ZSM, advanced network management procedures are required to detect and resolve anomalies within the 6G network autonomously, which usually requires artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. However, relying solely on AI can raise concerns about trust due to their lack of explainability. Indeed, as these models are not explainable, it is difficult to understand and trust their decisions. To overcome this limitation, this article introduces a novel pipeline for ensuring trustworthy ZSM in 6G networks by combining AI for detecting anomalies; eXplainable AI (XAI) to identify the root causes of anomalies using feature importance analysis; and large language models (LLMs) to generate user-friendly explanations and suggest/apply corrective actions to resolve anomalies. A use case is presented using XGBoost as AI, SHAP as XAI, and Llama2 as LLM to address service level agreement (SLA) latency violations within cloud-native 6G microservices. Evaluation results obtained through real experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency in scaling cloud resources to prevent SLA violations while providing understandable explanations to users, thereby enhancing trust in the system.",

    "abstract": "Consumer electronics have transformed the way we interact with technology, improving convenience and connectivity in day-to-day lives. In the healthcare sector, recent technologies have resulted in enhanced diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. Wearables, artificial intelligence-based data analytics, and telemedicine transform the way of monitoring and managing health, fostering a proactive approach to well-being. The popularity of ChatGPT is proven great potential for AI-generated content (AIGC) that has formed a major impact on the artificial intelligence (AI) community and accelerates the reconsidering of the prospects of general AI. The AIGC is also exposed as a considerable scope to impulse healthcare electronics (HE). Although generative AI has achieved popularity like the formation of images, it could be employed for producing synthetic tabular information. The production of synthetic electronic health records (EHR) undertakes to increase the utilization of machine learning (ML) methods that commonly function with massive quantities of data. ML will identify non-intuitive classifier patterns that permit a new integration of patient feature predictive ability. Currently, deep learning (DL) techniques are effectively utilized in EHR data from medical domains. DL methods excellently captured the significant and beneficial features and patterns from the comprehensive medical information in EHR data. This study presents AI-generated content for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Generation with a Deep Learning-based Diagnosis (SEHRG-DLD) Model. The focus of the SEHRG-DLD technique is to initially generate the synthetic EHR data and then analyze the medical data for disease diagnosis using the DL model. The SEHRG-DLD technique comprises a two-stage process: synthetic data generation and disease diagnosis. At the initial stage, the SEHRG-DLD technique uses the ChatGPT tool to generate synthetic EHR data. Then, the SEHRG-DLD technique undergoes the disease diagnosi...",

    "abstract": "Assuring safety of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to safety-critical systems is of paramount importance. Especially since research in the field of automated driving shows that AI is able to outperform classical approaches, to handle higher complexities, and to reach new levels of autonomy. At the same time, the safety assurance required for the use of AI in such safety-critical systems is still not in place. Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers and safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the current status, emerging trends, and possible future developments.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based models have revolutionized medical diagnostics by using Big Data to enhance disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, their significant computational demands and opaque decision making processes, often characterized as âblack-boxâ systems, pose major challenges in time-critical and resource constrained healthcare settings. To address these issues, this study explores the application of randomized machine learning models, specifically Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) networks, in medical diagnostics. These models introduce stochasticity into their training processes, reducing computational complexity and training times while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, we integrate Explainable AI techniques namely Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making rationale of ELMs and RVFL. Performance evaluations on genitourinary cancers and coronary artery disease datasets demonstrate that RVFL outperforms traditional deep learning models, achieving superioraccuracyof88.29%withacomputationaloverhead of 6.22 seconds for genitourinary cancers, and an accuracy of 81.64% with a computational time of 0.0308 seconds for coronary artery disease. This research highlights the potential of randomized models in enhancing efficiency and transparency in medical diagnosis, thereby accelerating better treatment outcomes and advocating for more accessible and interpretable AI solutions in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Supporting Extended Reality (XR) over traditional networks is challenging due to its bursty nature, low latency, and high-reliability requirements. We demonstrate that DiffServ in EPON results in low network utilization, around 10%. Additionally, XR frames are highly correlated due to changes in the application-layer data caused by human activity. By exploiting this correlation, in this letter, we introduce a cross-layer MAC scheduling termed \"Application-aware MAC,\" which provides a manifold increase in network utilization by introducing a small prediction error in the application layer. For enabling this, in this letter, we also suggest a modified split rendering architecture with additional NFVs.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in industries necessitates advancements in energy efficiency and latency reduction, especially for resource-constrained devices. Services require specific Quality of Service (QoS) levels to function properly, and meeting a threshold QoS can be sufficient for smooth connectivity, reducing the need to maximize perceived QoS due to energy concerns. This is modeled as a satisfactory game, aiming to find minimal power allocation to meet target demands. Due to environmental uncertainties, achieving a Robust Satisfactory Equilibrium (RSE) can be challenging, leading to less satisfaction. We propose a fully distributed, environment-aware power control scheme to enhance satisfaction in dynamic environments. The proposed Robust Banach-Picard (RBP) learning scheme combines deep learning and federated learning to overcome channel and interference impacts and accelerate convergence. Extensive simulations evaluate the scheme under varying channel states and QoS demands, with discussions on convergence speed, energy efficiency, scalability, complexity, and violation rate.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown exciting potential in powering the growth of many industries, yet their adoption in the power electronics (PE) sector is hindered by a lack of specialized PE technical expertise and challenges in processing PE-specific data. This study presents a pioneering approach to establish a multimodal LLM tailored for PE design applications, named PE-GPT. The methodology involves enhancing PE-GPT with retrieval augmented generation from a PE knowledge base, and proposes a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM agent with metaheuristic algorithms, Model Zoo, and Simulation Repository. This enhances its multimodal processing capabilities and enables integration into the existing design workflow. The PE-GPT methodology is demonstrated with two case studies: modulation design of the dual-active bridge (DAB) converter and circuit parameter design of the buck converter. PE-GPT demonstrates a 22.2% increase in correctness compared to human experts. Against other leading LLMs, PE-GPT shows a 35.6% improvement in correctness and a 15.4% enhancement in consistency, reducing hallucination. Hardware experiments validate PE-GPTâs multimodal capabilities in optimizing a five-degree-of-freedom modulation strategy for the DAB converter. The generalizability of PE-GPT to other PE design applications and associated AI ethical considerations are also discussed. This research concludes by outlining inspiring future research directions, encouraging researchers to expand the boundaries of the PE industry and advance toward a more intelligent era.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the deep learning (DL) based physical-layer secure beamforming design. A uniform DL framework is proposed, which exploits training set across various system utilities and enables transfer learning among them. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model named SecCNN and a graph neural network (GNN) based model named SecGNN are respectively designed to map channel vectors to beamforming and artificial noise vectors. The SecCNN adopts circular padding and full-size kernels to capture the global information, and the SecGNN adopts graph partition and semantic attention to distinguish different types of users. The models are trained via unsupervised learning. Numerical results evaluate the models in terms of the optimality, scalability, inference time, stability and transfer learning, which attains superior performance in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional centralized clustering, distributed clustering offers the advantage of parallel processing of data from different sites, enhancing the efficiency of clustering while preserving the privacy of the data at each site. However, most existing distributed clustering techniques require manual tuning of several parameters or hyperparameters, which can pose challenges for practical applications. This paper introduces a novel parameter-free distributed clustering framework known as distributed torque clustering (DTC). When dealing with data or subdata distributed across various sites, DTC predominantly executes two steps. The first step is a data reduction at each site using torque clustering, and the second step involves performing global clustering with weighted torque clustering. We compare DTC against six state-of-the-art distributed clustering algorithms and automatic centralized clustering techniques on ten large-scale or medium-scale datasets. The results show that the average rank of DTC is at least three times better than those of the other algorithms across all the datasets. Additionally, DTC can accurately predict the ground-truth number of clusters in nine out of ten datasets, further demonstrating its competitive performance and practical potential.",

    "abstract": "Brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) holds promise for enhancing neuromodulatory effects by synchronizing stimulation with specific features of cortical oscillations derived from real-time electroencephalography (EEG). However, conventional approaches rely on open-loop systems with static stimulation parameters, assuming that pre-determined EEG features universally indicate high or low excitability states. This one-size-fits-all approach overlooks individual neurophysiological differences and the dynamic nature of brain states, potentially compromising therapeutic efficacy. We present a supervised machine learning framework that predicts individual motor excitability states from pre-stimulus EEG features. Our approach combines established biomarkers with a comprehensive set of spectral and connectivity measures, implementing multi-scale feature selection within a nested cross-validation scheme. Validation across multiple classifiers, feature sets, and experimental protocols in 50 healthy participants demonstrated a mean prediction accuracy of 71 Â± 7%. Hierarchical clustering of top predictive EEG features revealed two distinct participant subgroups. The first subgroup, comprising approximately 50% of participants, showed predictive features predominantly in alpha and low-beta bands in sensorimotor regions of the stimulated hemisphere, aligning with traditional associations of motor excitability and the sensorimotor Î¼-rhythm. The second subgroup exhibited predictive features primarily in low and high gamma bands in parietal regions, suggesting that motor excitability is influenced by broader neural dynamics for these individuals. Our data-driven framework effectively identifies personalized motor excitability biomarkers, holding promise to optimize TMS interventions in clinical and research settings. Additionally, our approach provides a versatile platform for biomarker discovery and validation across diverse neuromodulation paradigms and bra...",

    "abstract": "Forecasting errors in power markets, even as small as 1%, can have significant financial implications. However, even high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) based electricity price forecasting (EPF) models have instances when their prediction error is much higher than those shown by mean performance metrics. To date, explainable AI has been used to enhance the model transparency and trustworthiness of AI-based EPF models. However, this paper demonstrates that insights from explainable AI (XAI) techniques can be expanded beyond its primary task of explanatory visualizations. This work presents a XAI-based error compensation approach to improve model performance and identify irregular predictions. The first phase of the proposed approach involves error quantification through a Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) based corrector model that fine-tunes the base predictorâs forecasts. Using this corrector modelâs SHAP explanations, the proposed approach distinguishes high-accuracy pre...",

    "abstract": "The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems reaches or even exceeds that of humans in an increasing number of complicated tasks. Highly effective non-linear AI models are generally employed in a black-box form nested in their complex structures, which means that no information as to what precisely helps them reach appropriate predictions is provided. The lack of transparency and interpretability in existing Artificial Intelligence techniques would reduce human usersâ trust in the models used for cyber defence, especially in current scenarios where cyber resilience is becoming increasingly diverse and challenging. Explainable AI (XAI) should be incorporated into developing cybersecurity models to deliver explainable models with high accuracy that human users can understand, trust, and manage. This paper explores the following concepts related to XAI. A summary of current literature on XAI is discussed. Recent taxonomies that help explain different machine learning algorithms are discussed. These include deep learning techniques developed and studied extensively in other IoT taxonomies. The outputs of AI models are crucial for cybersecurity, as experts require more than simple binary outputs for examination to enable the cyber resilience of IoT systems. Examining the available XAI applications and safety-related threat models to explain resilience towards IoT systems also summarises the difficulties and gaps in XAI concerning cybersecurity. Finally, various technical issues and trends are explained, and future studies on technology, applications, security, and privacy are presented, emphasizing the ideas of explainable AI models.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the demand for data-intensive analytics has surged. Consequently, extensive research on AI acceleration has been conducted to enhance AI performance. Processing-in-memory (PiM) has emerged as a promising AI acceleration architecture, offering an unprecedented high-bandwidth connection between compute and memory. However, integrating many components in PiM can lead to yield degradation. To address this issue, we propose an efficient test architecture that utilizes a hybrid built-in self-test (BIST) for PiM. This architecture utilizes the structural and operational characteristics of PiM to facilitate testing. It can execute testing through the existing functional paths without requiring any additional hardware implementation in PiM. Furthermore, it achieves a 100% test coverage with the small number of test patterns. In addition, the functionality of self-test can be realized for PiM through reconfiguration of the existing hardware, resulting in a very small area overhead.",

    "abstract": "The development of smart cities is being driven by consumer electronics-grade digital twin led by a robust combination of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. AI's capabilities for complex data analysis and pattern recognition provide a solid foundation for real-time data transfer and feedback in digital twin, enhancing simulation and analytics capabilities. The security and privacy of consumer electronics-grade digital twin are critical for smart cities, especially in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) security, as they simulate and control real-world critical infrastructure. The combination of sophisticated AI algorithms for network security and threat detection can effectively prevent potential network attacks and data breaches, ensuring the safety and reliability of digital twin systems. Smart transportation digital twin systems stand out as exemplary applications of AI technologies within the realm of digital twin. These systems simulate city traffic flows, autonomous vehicles, and urban planning, leading to improved traffic efficiency, reduced congestion and accidents, and promoting sustainable urban development. Considering the significance vehicle trajectory prediction holds in smart transportation digital twin systems, we propose a vehicle-to-vehicle interaction-based Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) model, which we experimentally analyzed for its performance in vehicle trajectory prediction.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, enabling LEO AI inference becomes a fast-increasing trend. However, due to resource heterogeneity, scheduling complexity, and fast movement, how to decide the place of executing each AI inference task is nontrivial in LEO systems. In this paper, we propose LEOEdge, an edge-assitsed AI inference system for LEO satellites. We first introduce the adaptive modeling technologies that automatically generate the model for each satellite according to its computation resources. We then propose a layered scheduling optimization scheme to schedule the AI inference task in a distributed manner. LEOEdge also designs a seamless data transmission scheme to avoid transmission failure due to the LEO satellite movement. We conduct a series of simulation tests to validate the performance of the proposed LEOEdge, in terms of the neural network searching efficiency, average time execution latency, and delivery latency.",

    "abstract": "Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) optimizes budget allocation and determines the return on advertising investment through market response analysis. MMM are vital tools to help marketers define their marketing strategies according to the firm's business and marketing objectives while reducing uncertainty in the decision-making process. As AI and automated MMM out-of-the-box packages gain popularity among marketers, it has become evident there is a theoretical and empirical gap in the understanding of the benefits and inconveniences of these new methods over traditional econometric models. To shed light on these questions, two different models using the same database from a telecommunications firm have been developed and tested using a traditional econometric model and Robyn, an AI-powered open-sourced MMM package from Meta Marketing Science. The research compares both methods' development processes and subsequent outputs from different perspectives: technical, business, and practical. It shows the advantages and shortcomings of each, providing insightful recommendations for academics and practitioners to navigate through the process of adoption of econometric and AI models for budget allocation decision-making. Econometric models are easy to explain and replicate, while AI complexity from the combination of several methods, their parametrization, and the random initialization of iterations during training, hinders its explainability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in channel state information (CSI) feedback tasks. Although current research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy through innovative AI approaches, the reliability of these systems in real-world scenarios often goes overlooked. Specifically, a closer examination of the feedback accuracy of individual CSI samples reveals significant variations, underscoring the imperative need for performance monitoring of AI-based CSI feedback. Building upon this observation, we introduce a pragmatic framework for AI-based CSI feedback. This process involves assessing feedback accuracy (i.e., conducting performance monitoring) on the user side before transmitting the CSI codeword. In particular, this method utilizes a lightweight proxy decoder, trained via knowledge distillation, to emulate the mapping function of the original decoder at the base station. The goal is to generate, at the user end, CSI identical to that produced at the base station by the original, more powerful decoder, thus enable precise prediction of feedback accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed performance monitoring method can precisely predict feedback accuracy with low complexity and accurately detect low-quality feedback samples with a detection rate of nearly 95%, ensuring reliable transmission.",

Specifically, we enumerate the key factors hindering the integration of AI/ML in real networks, and review existing solutions to uncover the missing components. Further, we highlight a promising direction, that is, machine learning operations (MLOps), that can close the gap. We believe this article spotlights the system-related considerations on implementing and maintaining ML-based solutions, and invigorates their full adoption in future networks.",

    "abstract": "AI is integral to our lives and consumer electronics (such as biometric recognition, autonomous vehicles, voice assistants, and others). However, the use of AI in consumer electronics also face serious security threats. Attackers can generate adversarial examples, to exploit AI vulnerabilities for specific attacks. This study discusses potential attack chains with adversarial examples and current developments in the broadly applicable field of image recognition. We also propose a simple black-box framework for generating adversarial examples that can be used to attack AI models. This framework enables the easy swapping of metaheuristics or other algorithms. The implementation includes some classic metaheuristics and introduces an effective quantum-inspired metaheuristic with an average success rate of 96.2%, thereby achieving an attack efficacy nearly equivalent to that of white-box attacks. Additionally, its convergence capability is superior to other well-known metaheuristic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Automatic identification system (AIS) with satellite components is exposed to increasing external attackers due to its high degree of openness. Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) offers a new perspective on AIS security solutions as a physical layer authentication scheme. However, existing RFFI methods are constrained by sensitivity to noise or interference, and these methods are cumbersome to tune when directly applied to satellite AIS (SAT-AIS). To this end, this paper proposes an RFFI method based on a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE). Specifically, the fractional lower-order cyclic spectrum as an extension of the conventional cyclic spectrum is used as a feature transformation to highlight the RFF features in the time-frequency domain. In addition, CVAE with multiple attention mechanisms is used to adaptively compress and extract discriminative RFF features to improve the RFFI accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can yield 98.28% accuracy at Eb/N0 of 10 dB, with high reliability and robustness under noise environment.",

    "abstract": "Developing non-visual sensing and intelligent recognition technologies is crucial for enhancing the manipulation performance of robots in dim or obstructed environments. Although precise object recognition has been extensively researched for rigid manipulators, the adoption of these techniques in soft robotic systems has been limited by the high modulus or low sensitivity of existing sensors (gauge factor/Youngâs modulus\n<\n10 kPa\nâ1\n). Meanwhile, these systems necessitate advanced artificial intelligence(AI) algorithms to effectively process multiple sensing data. In this study, we utilize newly developed soft sensors and AI algorithm to establish a biomimetic perceptual soft gripper system capable of sensing and generating category object information during the grasping task. A strain/pressure bimodal sensor, mimicking the exceptional softness (Youngâs modulus\n<\n10 kPa) and high sensitivity (gauge factor\n>\n2000) of human skin, has been developed and seamlessly integrated into a three-finger soft robotic gripper. A Swin Transformer network was developed to learn rules from bimodal data acquired from sensors and generate category information of the grasping objects. The perceptual gripper system exhibited superior recognition accuracy compared to previously reported systems, achieving an impressive 94.9% accuracy in categorizing 18 objects of varying shapes and sizes. We believe this advancement unlocks soft machinesâ potential for automated applications. Note to Practitioners âNon-visual sensing and recognition techniques for soft robotic grippers are valuable for operation in dimly lit or obstructed environments. Traditional rigid sensor have limitations when applied to soft robotic systems due to their high modulus. This research developed novel ultra-soft and high sensitive strain/pressure bimodal sensors integrated into a three-fingered soft robotic gripper. Meanwhile, an AI algorithm applicable to the soft gripper system was developed to pro...",

    "abstract": "The development of Generative AI (GAI) and AI-generated content (AIGC) has been significantly improved by pretrained foundation models and prompt-based methods. To boost the quality and reduce the latency of AIGC generation, prompt engineering and edge computing are introduced, demanding a multi-dimensional resource allocation approach. Thus, we use the generative diffusion model (GDM) and contract theory to design a two-stage, multi-dimensional resource allocation framework. In the first stage, we employ an approximation approach to quantitatively assess the relationship between the level of prompt optimization, the number of diffusion denoising steps, and the quality of AIGC generation. Based on the quality function, we formulate models for the utilities of an AI-generated content Service Provider (ASP) and users, leading to a non-convex quality-based contract problem optimizing the level of prompt optimization and the number of diffusion denoising steps. To address the time-consuming process of solving the non-convex problem due to variable cost of the ASP and gain preferences of the users, a GDM-based scheme is proposed to optimize quality-based contract items. In the second stage, for each group of users who choose the same quality-based contract items, a non-convex latency-based contract problem optimizing the CPU cycle frequency and network transmission rate is formulated, then the GDM-based scheme is also applied to find the optimal latency-based contract items. Numerical results show that the proposed GDM-based contract generation scheme is very advantageous in improving the quality of AIGC generation and decreasing the latency of AIGC generation, compared to other standard schemes.",

    "abstract": "Edge artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging solution for pervasive intelligence service in future 6G networks, by learning machine learning (ML) models at network edge. Edge AI typically consists of three processes: sensing, communication and computation (SC2). Edge devices first collect data samples through the sensing process, then train local models individually through the computation process, and finally update the local models periodically through the communication process to obtain the global model. Federated edge learning (FEEL) is particularly attractive for Edge AI due to its collaborative ML framework and privacy-enhancing feature. However, the research FEEL with sensing, communication and computation integration remains an open question. On the one hand, there is still a lack of theoretical insight into the learning performance that is jointly influenced by the processes of SC2. On the other hand, the performance evaluation is another challenge for the proposed SC2-FEEL, which further poses the difficulties in design of efficient resource allocation. To address these issues, a SC2 integrated FEEL (SC2-FEEL) is investigated in this paper, where the processes of SC2 are jointly considered and the over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique is employed for a communication-efficient model aggregation. First, theoretical analyses are conducted, which reveals both the sample sensing strategy and the AirComp-induced communication error significant affect the learning performance of SC2-FEEL. Then, we further formulate a latency and energy consumption minimization problem with learning performance guaranteed based on the theoretical results, which is mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and dynamic programming. To deal with this problem, we propose a joint SC2 resource optimization strategy with low complexity based on the block coordinate update and Lyapunov optimization framework. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our theoretic...",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms have been reshaping the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) landscape. These transformations not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and productivity of SDLC tasks but also influence the roles and existence of software personas within the SDLC ecosystem. This study evaluates GenAI's effects on the roles of software personas engaged in the typical SDLC phases: planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. When evaluating these effects, it becomes evident that GenAI's impact varies across roles and their relation to specific SDLC phases and activities. While some roles experience a substantial impact, achieving full AI-driven automation remains a challenge for roles that demand critical thinking, empathy, and other human supervision. Overall, GenAI's penetration will necessitate new skills and a redefinition of roles for many tasks within SDLC, where humans and AI will collaborate to create better, faster, and more efficient software.",

    "abstract": "Task-oriented communications are an important element in future intelligent IoT systems. Existing IoT systems, however, are limited in their capacity to handle complex tasks, particularly in their interactions with humans to accomplish these tasks. In this article, we present LLMind, a large language model-based (LLM-based), task-oriented AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices, with humans communicating high-level verbal instructions, to perform complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language- Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices with continuous monitoring capabilities are critical for the daily detection of epileptic seizures, as they provide users with accurate and comprehensible analytical results. However, current AI classifiers rely on a two-stage recognition process for continuous monitoring, which only reduces operation time but remains challenged by the high cost of additional hardware. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel fusion architecture for AI processors, which enables event-triggered cross-paradigm integration and computation. Our method introduces a distributed-aggregated classification architecture (D-ACA) that facilitates the reuse of hardware resources across two-stage recognition, thereby obviating the need for standby hardware and enhancing energy efficiency. Integrating a non-encoding biomedical circuit method based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), the architecture eliminates encoded neurons at the hardware level, significantly optimizing energy consumption and hardware resource utilization. Additionally, we develop a configurable and highly flexible control method that supports various neuron modules, enabling continuous detection of epileptic seizures and activating high-precision recognition upon event detection. Finally, we implement the design on the Xilinx ZCU 102 FPGA board, where the AI processor achieves a high classification accuracy of 98.1% while consuming extremely low classification energy (3.73 Î¼J per classification).",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, the development of CT technologies has been largely driven by the need for cardiac imaging but the temporal resolution remains insufficient for clinical CT in difficult cases and rather challenging for preclinical CT since small animals have much higher heart rates than humans. To address this challenge, here we report a Semi-stationary Multi-source AI-based Real-time Tomography (SMART) CT system. This unique scanner is featured by 29 source-detector pairs fixed on a circular track to collect X-ray signals in parallel, enabling instantaneous tomography in principle. Given the multi-source architecture, the field-of-view only covers a cardiac region. To solve the interior problem, an AI-empowered interior tomography approach is developed to synergize sparsity-based regularization and learning-based reconstruction. To demonstrate the performance and utilities of the SMART system, extensive results are obtained in physical phantom experiments and animal studies, including dead and live rats as well as live rabbits. The reconstructed volumetric images convincingly demonstrate the merits of the SMART system using the AI-empowered interior tomography approach, enabling cardiac CT with the unprecedented temporal resolution of 33ms, which enjoys the highest temporal resolution than the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence analysis is a function of government, which provides insight into current and emerging issues so that decision-makers can make informed resolutions. In the national security context, the way Intelligence practices its craft has been fairly consistent since the post-Cold War era. However, analysisâthe act of breaking down an issue into parts and studying those parts in separationâmay no longer be fit for the range of complex, interconnected, and unfamiliar problems that we are currently observing in our national security landscape. This article is an initial exploration into how other disciplinary practices deal with understanding emerging and unfamiliar contexts. To carry out this exploration, we discuss the role of design as a practice adept at sensemaking into the unknown and observe its practices when applied to an emerging national security context: artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity. We provide grounding in a literature review on current Intelligence practices and introduce a design-based methodology for exploring the issue of AI in cybersecurity through a sensemaking approach. In the results section, we highlight the insights around the use of a persona and scenarios as gleaned from interviews conducted with the core design team (CDT). Finally, we discuss how these human-centered approaches translate into new possibilities for National Security Intelligence work. They include novel ways of exploring unfamiliar issues (such as AI in cybersecurity), ways of identifying harms associated with the issue, and, finally, new ways of partnering with civic communities in ways that are novel to how Intelligence currently engages with the public. This studyâs main contributions are the potential new practices needed for exploring emerging national security issues based on a fundamentally different way of viewing problemsâthat being a sensemaking approach.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based channel state information (CSI) prediction, aimed at enhancing CSI accuracy and reducing overhead, has shown significant advancements over traditional model-based prediction methods. Despite these advantages, its practical deployment has been hindered by unreliable prediction performance due to AI instability. This study introduces a reliable AI-based CSI prediction framework by implementing a proxy-based performance monitoring mechanism. Specifically, we deploy a lightweight proxy at the user equipment (UE), trained via knowledge distillation to accommodate the UEâs limited capacities. This proxy mimics the output of the CSI prediction network at the base station (BS) side, enabling the UE to monitor the accuracy of the predicted CSI and prevent undesirable outcomes. To overcome the deployment challenges in operational systems, we detail the practical implementation procedures of our proposed method, covering both offline training and online operation phases. Simulation results show that our proxy-based monitor can achieve over 90% consistency with the CSI prediction network at the BS side and avoid over 85% of unsatisfactory prediction outcomes under various practical considerations, demonstrating remarkable generalization capabilities across different configurations.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) has gained significant attention in recent years for its applications in training and assistance in various industrial settings. Yet, a less understood question is: How can AR systems, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, adaptively tailor instructions and feedback interventions to the specific needs of users, their cognitive states, and level of expertise during task execution? This paper addresses this question by conducting a systematic review that delves into three specific research areas: the state-of-the-art of AR-based systems for industrial applications in terms of features and training/assistance capabilities, the existing gaps in transforming AR into an âintelligent companionâ that adapts to both the work context and the userâs needs, and how these sources of multimodal data captured by AR headsets, wearables, and IoT sensors can be harnessed to interpret, predict, and guide task performance and learning through AR. To this end, this paper synthesizes recent studies in the field of industrial AR, summarizing their main findings, contributions, and associated limitations when integrating AI capabilities into AR. The results suggest that AR can effectively tackle key industry challenges associated with training and upskilling, process improvement, and error prevention. However, significant limitations remain, especially in integrating multimodal data-driven capabilities into AR to effectively tailor AR guides to how individual workers learn and perform complex industrial tasks. The paper concludes with a framework as well as several research directions and examples to realize intelligent AR systems enhanced with advanced AI capabilities for activity understanding, user modeling, and interventions, serving as adaptive and personalized companions for industrial workers.",

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) containing a large number of decision variables, which are also known as large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), pose great challenges to most existing evolutionary algorithms. This is mainly because that a high dimensional decision space degrades the effectiveness of search operators notably, and balancing convergence and diversity becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a two-population based algorithm for large-scale multi-objective optimization named LSTPA. In the proposed algorithm, solutions are classified in to two subpopulations: a Convergence subPopulation (CP) and a Diversity subPopulation (DP), aiming at convergence and diversity respectively. In order to improve convergence speed, a fitness-aware variation operator (FAVO) is applied to drive DP solutions towards CP. Besides, an adaptive penalty based boundary intersection (APBI) strategy is adopted for environmental selection in order to balance convergence and diversity temporally during different stages of evolution process. Experimental results on benchmark test problems with 100-2000 decision variables demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the best overall performance compared with several state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing autonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test scenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial, thanks to the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce a natural adversarial scenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and reinforcement learning techniques. By doing this, we can obtain large-scale test scenarios that are both diverse and realistic. Specifically, we build a simulation environment that mimics natural traffic interaction scenarios. Informed by this environment, we implement a two-stage procedure. The first stage incorporates conventional rule-based models, e.g., IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) and MOBIL (Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes) model, to coarsely and discretely capture and calibrate key control parameters from the real-world dataset. Next, we leverage GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning) to represent driver behaviors continuously. The derived GAIL can be further used to design a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)-based actor-critic network framework to fine-tune the reward function, and then optimize our natural adversarial scenario generation solution. Extensive experiments have been conducted in two popular datasets, NGSIM and INTERACTION. Essential traffic parameters were measured in comparison with the baseline model, e.g., the collision rate, accelerations, steering, and the number of lane changes. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model can generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness and adversariality with an advanced 44% efficiency gain over the baseline model, which can be a cornerstone for the development of autonomous vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) is a popular research field in computer vision that has already been widely studied. However, it is still an active research field since it plays an important role in many current and emerging real-world intelligent systems, like visual surveillance and humanâcomputer interaction. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been used to address the activity recognition problem with various purposes, such as finding attention in video data or obtaining the best network structure. DRL-based HAR has only been around for a short time, and it is a challenging, novel field of study. Therefore, to facilitate further research in this area, we have constructed a comprehensive survey on activity recognition methods that incorporate DRL. Throughout the article, we classify these methods according to their shared objectives and delve into how they are ingeniously framed within the DRL framework. As we navigate through the survey, we conclude by shedding light on the prominent challenges and lingering questions that await the attention of future researchers, paving the way for further advancements and breakthroughs in this exciting domain.",

    "abstract": "With the acceleration of urbanization, the problem of urban traffic congestion has become increasingly serious. This study aims to develop an intelligent traffic flow control system based on sixth-generation (6G) communication technology to achieve real-time prediction and management of traffic flow, optimize signal control, and reduce accident rates, thereby improving urban traffic efficiency and safety. This study constructs an intelligent traffic flow control system framework consisting of network, platform, perception, and application layers. The system utilizes vehicle networking technology and various sensors to collect traffic data and ensures real-time transmission of data through 6G communication technology. Meantime, the optimized genetic algorithm is used to optimize the traffic flow, solve the complex traffic optimization problems, and improve the overall efficiency of the traffic system. The platform layer employs machine learning algorithms to analyze and process data, predict traffic flow, and formulate traffic management strategies. The systemâs effectiveness is verified through experiments and comparative analysis with actual data. The results show that the error rate of traffic flow prediction during peak hours is as low as 0.81%, and signal control optimization reduces the average traffic delay by 15%. By implementing improved traffic management measures, the average annual accident rate has decreased by over 40%, and user satisfaction has increased by 30%. It can be found that the 6G-based intelligent traffic flow control system can effectively enhance the accuracy and response speed of traffic prediction, optimize signal control, remarkably reduce the accident rate, and improve the overall satisfaction of users.",

    "abstract": "Endovascular intervention is a minimally invasive method for treating cardiovascular diseases. Although fluoroscopy, known for real-time catheter visualization, is commonly used, it exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation and lacks depth perception due to its 2D nature. To address these limitations, a study was conducted using teleoperation and 3D visualization techniques. This in-vitro study involved the use of a robotic catheter system and aimed to evaluate user performance through both subjective and objective measures. The focus was on determining the most effective modes of interaction. Three interactive modes for guiding robotic catheters were compared in the study: 1) Mode GM, using a gamepad for control and a standard 2D monitor for visual feedback; 2) Mode GH, with a gamepad for control and HoloLens providing 3D visualization; and 3) Mode HH, where HoloLens serves as both control input and visualization device. Mode GH outperformed other modalities in subjective metrics, except for mental demand. It exhibited a median tracking error of 4.72 mm, a median targeting error of 1.01 mm, a median duration of 82.34 s, and a median natural logarithm of dimensionless squared jerk of 40.38 in the in-vitro study. Mode GH showed 8.5%, 4.7%, 6.5%, and 3.9% improvements over Mode GM and 1.5%, 33.6%, 34.9%, and 8.1% over Mode HH for tracking error, targeting error, duration, and dimensionless squared jerk, respectively. To sum up, the user study emphasizes the potential benefits of employing HoloLens for enhanced 3D visualization in catheterization. The user study also illustrates the advantages of using a gamepad for catheter teleoperation, including user-friendliness and passive haptic feedback, compared to HoloLens. To further gauge the potential of using a more traditional joystick as a control input device, an additional study utilizing the Haption Virtuose TM robot was conducted. It reveals the potential for achieving smoother trajectories, with a ...",

    "abstract": "The growing ubiquity of machine learning (ML) has led it to enter various areas of computer science, including black-box optimization (BBO). Recent research is particularly concerned with Bayesian optimization (BO). BO-based algorithms are popular in the ML community, as they are used for hyperparameter optimization and more generally for algorithm configuration. However, their efficiency decreases as the dimensionality of the problem and the budget of evaluations increase. Meanwhile, derivative-free optimization methods have evolved independently in the optimization community. Therefore, we urge to understand whether cross-fertilization is possible between the two communities, ML and BBO, i.e., whether algorithms that are heavily used in ML also work well in BBO and vice versa. Comparative experiments often involve rather small benchmarks and show visible problems in the experimental setup, such as poor initialization of baselines, overfitting due to problem-specific setting of hyperparameters, and low statistical significance. With this paper, we update and extend a comparative study presented by Hutter et al. in 2013. We compare BBO tools for ML with more classical heuristics, first on the well-known BBOB benchmark suite from the COCO environment and then on Direct Policy Search for OpenAI Gym, a reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results confirm that BO-based optimizers perform well on both benchmarks when budgets are limited, albeit with a higher computational cost, while they are often outperformed by algorithms from other families when the evaluation budget becomes larger. We also show that some algorithms from the BBO community perform surprisingly well on ML tasks.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSup-OD) increases the usefulness and interpretability of image classification algorithms without requiring additional supervision. The successes of multiple instance learning in this task for natural images, however, do not translate well to medical images due to the very different characteristics of their objects (i.e. pathologies). In this work, we propose Weakly Supervised ROI Proposal Networks (WSRPN), a new method for generating bounding box proposals on the fly using a specialized region of interest-attention (ROI-attention) module. WSRPN integrates well with classic backbone-head classification algorithms and is end-to-end trainable with only image-label supervision. We experimentally demonstrate that our new method outperforms existing methods in the challenging task of disease localization in chest X-ray images.

    "abstract": "This survey explores the transformative role of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technologies in vehicular communication systems. It begins by introducing key RIS concepts and classifying them into passive, active, and hybrid types, with particular focus on beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) and its various architectural designs. The study then delves into the evolution of vehicular communication technologies, followed by channel modeling and strategies to ensure long-term system adaptability. The survey further investigates key technological advancements, such as advanced channel modeling and estimation techniques, strategies for optimizing network sum-rate and energy efficiency (EE), and enhancing security within vehicular networks through RIS. Additionally, it examines the integration of RIS with vehicular edge computing (VEC) frameworks, its potential in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported networks, and its application in visible light communication (VLC) systems. The analysis also considers the synergy between RIS and mmWave technologies. Then, a comprehensive performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the impact of these advancements in RIS-based vehicular networks. The aim is to thoroughly elaborate, compare, and evaluate the literature concerning network scenarios, RIS details, methodologies, and optimization objectives. Conclusively, the research highlights key findings and charts future research directions, pinpointing imminent technical challenges and emerging areas for further exploration in the rapidly evolving landscape of vehicular communications.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) based Wi-Fi sensing has witnessed great development in recent years. Although decent results have been achieved in certain scenarios, Wi-Fi based activity recognition is still difficult to deploy in real smart homes due to the limited cross-environment adaptability, i.e. a well-trained Wi-Fi sensing neural network in one environment is hard to adapt to other environments. To address this challenge, we propose AdaWiFi , a DL-based Wi-Fi sensing framework that allows multiple Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to collaborate and adapt to various environments effectively. The key innovation of AdaWiFi includes a collective sensing model architecture that utilizes complementary information between distinct devices and avoids the biased perception of individual sensors and an accompanying model adaptation technique that can transfer the sensing model to new environments with limited data. We evaluate our system on a public dataset and a custom dataset collected from three complex sensing environments. The results demonstrate that AdaWiFi is able to achieve significantly better sensing adaptation effectiveness (e.g. 30% higher accuracy with one-shot adaptation) as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Fully-unsupervised Person and Vehicle Re-Identification have received increasing attention due to their broad applicability in areas such as surveillance, forensics, event understanding, and smart cities, without requiring any manual annotation. However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets that have just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the use of costly techniques in terms of time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, to improve clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects the best clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in a large-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles a more realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scale unlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling to reduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhood relationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, which has a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity from O(n2) to O(kn) with kn. To avoid the need for pre-selection of specific hyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novel scheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, to leverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisy labeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by different models in an ensemble, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon the permutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need for any hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in the challenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficient Re-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-based learning approach.",

    "abstract": "Previous Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) methods face the challenge of generalizing to unseen domains, mainly because most existing FAS datasets are relatively small and lack data diversity. Thanks to the development of face recognition in the past decade, numerous real face images are available publicly, which are however neglected previously by the existing literature. In this paper, we propose an Anomalous cue Guided FAS (AG-FAS) method, which can effectively leverage large-scale additional real faces for improving model generalization via a De-fake Face Generator (DFG). Specifically, by training on a large-scale real face only dataset, the generator obtains the knowledge of what a real face should be like, and thus has the capability of generating a ârealâ version of any input face image. Consequently, the difference between the input face and the generated ârealâ face can be treated as cues of attention for the fake feature learning. With the above ideas, an Off-real Attention Network (OA-Net) is proposed which allocates its attention to the spoof region of the input according to the anomalous cue. Extensive experiments on a total of nine public datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art results under cross-domain evaluations with unseen scenarios and unknown presentation attacks. Besides, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed anomalous cues.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-enhanced text generation aims to enhance the quality of generated text by utilizing internal or external knowledge sources. While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and lowlevel knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model's output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWire- FG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.",

    "abstract": "A series of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed for expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs), building cheap surrogate models to replace the expensive real function evaluations. However, the search efficiency of these SAEAs is not yet satisfactory. More efforts are needed to further exploit useful information from the real function evaluations in order to better guide the search process. Facing this challenge, this paper proposes a Hyperbolic Neural Network (HNN) based preselection operator to accelerate the optimization process based on limited evaluated solutions. First, the preselection task is modeled as a multi-label classification problem where solutions are classified into different layers (ordinal categories) through -relaxed objective aggregation. Second, in order to resemble the hierarchical structure of candidate solutions, a hyperbolic neural network is applied to tackle the multi-label classification problem. The reason for using HNN is that hyperbolic spaces more closely resemble hierarchical structures than Euclidean spaces. Moreover, to alleviate the data deficiency issue, a data augmentation strategy is employed for training the HNN. In order to evaluate its performance, the proposed HNN-based preselection operator is embedded into two surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results on two benchmark test suites and three real-world problems with up to 11 objectives and 150 decision variables involving seven state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG emotion recognition should identify emotions accurately and elucidate corresponding rationales. Current GNNs have achieved notable performance by dynamically modeling emotional connections between EEG channels. However, these GNNs lack interpretability due to the absence of explicit rationale behind their predictions. This paper conducts a comprehensive identification of important EEG channels to enhance the interpretability of EEG emotion recognition from the perspective of mutual information. Specifically, an Adjacency-Explainable Graph Neural Network (AEG) for ante-hoc interpretability is proposed to capture genuine EEG emotional connections, which gives a theoretical guarantee to remove spurious connections. Moreover, a Channel-wise Adaptive Class Activation Mapping Explainer (CACA) for post-hoc interpretability is developed to locate the EEG channels that contribute most to predictions. Experimental results on three datasets, i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, and DREAMER, prove that imbuing training processes with enhanced interpretability ensures significant performance improvements in emotion recognition. Quantitative comparisons of post-hoc interpretability also demonstrate the superiority of CACA. Furthermore, this paper illustrates two potential applications of the proposed methodologies, showing their broader utility and significance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, personality has been considered as a valuable personal factor being incorporated into the provision of personalized learning. Although some studies have endeavored to obtain learners' personalities implicitly from their learning behaviors, they failed to achieve satisfactory prediction performance. On the one hand, most existing approaches ignore the imbalanced distribution of personality classes, which causes the personality classifiers to be biased toward the non-extreme personality class. On the other hand, the related methods normally focus on constructing statistical behavior features, while the sequence information of learning behaviors is ignored, but actually it can reflect learners' behavior patterns more finely. In this paper, inspired by the human learning strategy in the face of small samples, we propose an effective Demographic-Guided Behavior Patterns Contrast (DGBPC) model to classify learners' personalities through the demographic-guided contrast of learners' coarse behavior patterns. Besides, we construct and publish the Personality and Learning Behavior Dataset (PLBD), which should be one of the largest public datasets regarding Big-Five personality and learning behavior sequence according to our knowledge. The experimental results on PLBD demonstrate that our DGBPC model could generate learner representations with higher discrimination and outperform the related methods in terms of balanced accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel global pandemic, which requires rapid and accurate identification techniques to curb its spread. COVID-19, the disease induced by the virus, causes severe respiratory complications, necessitating advanced diagnostic tools for early detection. Recent research indicates the potential of radiographic imaging in unravelling critical insights into the characteristics of this formidable pathogen. Leveraging the advancements in Computer Vision (CV) and deep learning methodologies, an automated system can be devised to discern respiratory anomalies from X-ray images, enhancing conventional diagnostic methods. In this study, we propose a pioneering approach for COVID-19 diagnosis utilizing chest radiographs. The proposed methodology encompasses four distinct phases: initial segmentation of raw chest radiographs employing Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), followed by feature extraction through a tailored pipeline integrating both manual computer vision algorithms and pre-trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Subsequently, a graph-based feature reconstruction technique amalgamates these extracted features across the network, culminating in a comprehensive representation. These reconstructed features serve as input to a classification module, comprising a multi-layer neural network, GCN, adept at processing graph-structured data, alongside conventional machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF), facilitating categorization of chest X-ray images into COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases. Furthermore, we conduct an exhaustive evaluation of the selected DNN architectures to ascertain the efficacy of our proposed models vis-Ã -vis existing research, thus ensuring the deployment of the most robust diagnostic framework.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression searches for analytic expressions that accurately describe studied phenomena. The main promise of this approach is that it may return an interpretable model that can be insightful to users, while maintaining high accuracy. The current standard for benchmarking these algorithms is SRBench, which evaluates methods on hundreds of datasets that are a mix of real-world and simulated processes spanning multiple domains. At present, the ability of SRBench to evaluate interpretability is limited to measuring the size of expressions on real-world data, and the exactness of model forms on synthetic data. In practice, model size is only one of many factors used by subject experts to determine how interpretable a model truly is. Furthermore, SRBench does not characterize algorithm performance on specific, challenging sub-tasks of regression such as feature selection and evasion of local minima. In this work, we propose and evaluate an approach to benchmarking SR algorithms that addresses these limitations of SRBench by 1) incorporating expert evaluations of interpretability on a domain-specific task, and 2) evaluating algorithms over distinct properties of data science tasks. We evaluate 12 modern symbolic regression algorithms on these benchmarks and present an in-depth analysis of the results, discuss current challenges of symbolic regression algorithms and highlight possible improvements for the benchmark itself.",

    "abstract": "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) represents a paradigm of providing patient care grounded in the most current and rigorously evaluated research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to transform EBM by automating labor-intensive tasks and thereby improving the efficiency of clinical decision-making. This study explores integrating LLMs into the key stages in EBM, evaluating their ability across evidence retrieval (PICO extraction, biomedical question answering), synthesis (summarizing randomized controlled trials), and dissemination (medical text simplification). We conducted a comparative analysis of seven LLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, as well as those fine-tuned on medical corpora. Specifically, we benchmarked the performance of various LLMs on each EBM task under zero-shot settings as baselines, and employed prompting techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and knowledge-guided prompting to enhance their capabilities. Our extensive experiments revealed the strengths of LLMs, such as remarkable understanding capabilities even in zero-shot settings, strong summarization skills, and effective knowledge transfer via prompting. Promoting strategies such as knowledge-guided prompting proved highly effective (e.g., improving the performance of GPT-4 by 13.10% over zero-shot in PICO extraction). However, the experiments also showed limitations, with LLM performance falling well below state-of-the-art baselines like PubMedBERT in handling named entity recognition tasks. Moreover, human evaluation revealed persisting challenges with factual inconsistencies and domain inaccuracies, underscoring the need for rigorous quality control before clinical application. This study provides insights into enhancing EBM using LLMs while highlighting critical areas for further research. The code is publicly available on Github.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is challenged by the distributional shift problem. To tackle this issue, existing works mainly focus on designing sophisticated policy constraints between the learned policy and the behavior policy. However, these constraints are applied equally to well-performing and inferior actions through uniform sampling, which might negatively affect the learned policy. In this article, we propose offline decoupled prioritized resampling(ODPR), which designs specialized priority functions for the suboptimal policy constraint issue in offline RL and employs unique decoupled resampling for training stability. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the distinctive priority functions induce a provable improved behavior policy by modifying the distribution of the original behavior policy, and when constrained to this improved policy, a policy-constrained offline RL algorithm is likely to yield a better solution. We provide two practical implementations to balance computation and performance: one estimates priorities based on a fit value network advantage-based ODPR (ODPR-A) and the other utilizes trajectory returns return-based ODPR (ODPR-R) for quick computation. As a highly compatible plug-and-play component, ODPRis evaluated with five prevalent offline RL algorithms: behavior cloning (BC), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient\n+\nBC (TD3\n+\nBC), OnestepRL, conservative Q-learning (CQL), and implicit Q-learning (IQL). Our experiments confirm that both ODPR-Aand ODPR-Rsignificantly improve performance across all baseline methods. Moreover, ODPR-Acan be effective in some challenging settings, i.e., without trajectory information. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/yueyang130/ODPR.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant advances achieved in deep learning, the deep neural networksâ (DNNs) design approach remains notoriously tedious, depending primarily on intuition, experience, and trial and error. This human-dependent process is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Furthermore, the models are generally bound to their training contexts, with no considerations to their surrounding environments. Continual adaptiveness and automation of neural networks is of paramount importance to several domains where model accessibility is limited after deployment (e.g., IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, etc.). Additionally, even accessible models require frequent maintenance postdeployment to overcome issues such as data/concept drift, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. By leveraging and combining approaches from neural architecture search (NAS) and continual learning (CL), more robust and adaptive agents can be developed. This study conducts the first extensive review on the intersection between NAS and CL, formalizing the prospective paradigm and outlining research directions for lifelong autonomous DNNs.",

We start by presenting enhancements to Karnik-Mendel (KM) and Nie-Tan (NT) Center of Sets Calculation Methods (CSCMs) to increase their learning capacities. The enhancements increase the flexibility of KM in the defuzzification stage while the NT in the fuzzification stage. We also present a parametric KM CSCM, aimed to reduce the inference complexity of KM while providing flexibility. To address large-scale learning challenges, we convert the constraint learning problem of IT2-FLS into an unconstrained form using parameterization tricks, allowing for the direct application of deep learning optimizers and automatic differentiation methods. In tackling the curse of dimensionality issue, we expand the High dimensional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang method (HTSK) proposed for type-1 FLS to IT2-FLSs, resulting in the HTSK for IT2-FLSs. We also introduce an enhanced HTSK for IT2-FLSs from an alternative perspective, featuring a comparatively simpler computational nature. Finally, we introduce a framework to learn IT2-FLSs with a dual focus, aiming for high precision and PI generation. Our comprehensive statistical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the enhancements for uncertainty quantification via IT2-FLSs.",

    "abstract": "The underlying time-variant and subject-specific brain dynamics lead to statistical uncertainty in electroencephalogram (EEG) representations and connectivities under diverse individual biases. Current works primarily augment statisticallike EEG data based on deterministic modes without comprehensively considering uncertain statistical discrepancies in representations and connectivities. This results in insufficient domain diversity to cover more domain variations for a generalized model independent of individuals. This article proposes an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation network (Ugan) to generalize EEG emotion recognition across subjects by comprehensively mimicking and constraining the uncertain statistical shifts across individuals. Specifically, an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation module is employed to augment both connectivities and features of EEG graph by manipulating domain statistical characteristics. With the original and augmented EEG graph covering diverse domain variations, the model can mimic the uncertain domain shifts to achieve better generalizability against potential subject variability. To extract discriminative characteristics and preserve emotional semantics after augmentation, a graph coteaching learning module is designed to facilitate coteaching knowledge learning between the original and augmented views. Moreover, a coteaching regularization module is developed to constrain semantic domain invariance and consistency, thereby rendering the model invariant to uncertain statistical shifts. Extensive experiments on three public EEG emotion datasets, i.e., Shanghai Jiao Tong University emotion EEG dataset (SEED), SEED-IV, and SEED-V, validate the superior generalizability of Ugan compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we propose a new model CTAP to coordinate these two goals for high-quality continuous translation based on RAs. In CTAP, we simultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to the desired image with smooth nuanced changes w.r.t. the interested attributes; and a ranker that executes adversarial preferences consisting of the input image and the desired image. Particularly, adversarial preferences involve an adversarial ranking process: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the des...",

    "abstract": "Tracking permanent magnets represents a low-footprint and passive approach to monitoring objects or human motion by attaching or embedding magnets therein. Recent tracking techniques achieved high-bandwidth detection considering a simplified model for the magnetic sources, i.e. the dipole model. Nonetheless, such a model can lead to inaccurate results any time a non-spherical magnet approaches the sensor array. Here, we present a novel tracking algorithm based on an analytical model for permanent magnet cylinders with uniform arbitrary magnetization. By means of a physical system mounting 20 magnetometers, we compared the tracking accuracy obtained with our algorithm vs. results obtained by using the dipole model and with respect to a ground-truth reference. With a single magnetic target, our algorithm can significantly lower position (up to 0.68 mm) and orientation errors (up to 2.5â) while enabling online tracking (computation time below 19 ms). We also accurately tracked two magnets, by obtaining a reduction in position error (up to 0.92 mm) vs. the dipole-based algorithm. These findings broaden the applicability of accurate magnetic tracking to real-time applications, facilitating the tracking of multiple magnetic targets in proximity of the magnetic sensors. This advancement opens avenues for applications in wearable devices, advancing the field of motion detection beyond traditional inertial measurement units.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation presents a unique challenge of efficiently using limited labeled data while leveraging abundant unlabeled data. Despite advancements, existing methods often do not fully exploit the potential of the unlabeled data for enhancing model robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce CrossMatch, a novel framework that integrates knowledge distillation with dual perturbation strategies, image-level and feature-level, to improve the model's learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. CrossMatch employs multiple encoders and decoders to generate diverse data streams, which undergo self-knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency and reliability of predictions across varied perturbations. Our method significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art techniques in standard benchmarks by effectively minimizing the gap between training on labeled and unlabeled data and improving edge accuracy and generalization in medical image segmentation. The efficacy of CrossMatch is demonstrated through extensive experimental validations, showing remarkable performance improvements without increasing computational costs. Code for this implementation is made available at https://github.com/AiEson/CrossMatch.git .",

    "abstract": "Vehicular mobility underscores the need for collaborative misbehavior detection at the vehicular edge. However, locally trained misbehavior detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that aim to deliberately influence learning outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that employs transfer learning for collaborative misbehavior detection among roadside units (RSUs). In the presence of label-flipping and policy induction attacks, we perform selective knowledge transfer from trustworthy source RSUs to foster relevant expertise in misbehavior detection and avoid negative knowledge sharing from adversary-influenced RSUs. The performance of our proposed scheme is demonstrated with evaluations over a diverse set of misbehavior detection scenarios using an open-source dataset. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the training time at the target RSU and achieves superior detection performance compared to the baseline scheme with tabula rasa learning. Enhanced robustness and generalizability can also be attained, by effectively detecting previously unseen and partially observable misbehavior attacks.",

    "abstract": "The adversarial vulnerability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) refers to the performance degradation of CNNs under adversarial attacks, leading to incorrect decisions. However, the causes of adversarial vulnerability in CNNs remain unknown. To address this issue, we propose a unique cross-scale analytical approach from a statistical physics perspective. It reveals that the huge amount of nonlinear effects inherent in CNNs is the fundamental cause for the formation and evolution of system vulnerability. Vulnerability is spontaneously formed on the macroscopic level after the symmetry of the system is broken through the nonlinear interaction between microscopic state order parameters. We develop a cascade failure algorithm, visualizing how micro perturbations on neuronsâ activation can cascade and influence macro decision paths. Our empirical results demonstrate the interplay between microlevel activation maps and macrolevel decision-making and provide a statistical physics perspective to understand the causality behind CNN vulnerability. Our work will help subsequent research to improve the adversarial robustness of CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of ultrasound (US) images with deep learning has played a crucial role in computer-aided disease screening, diagnosis and prognosis. However, due to the scarcity of US images and small field of view, resulting segmentation models are tailored for a specific single organ and may lack robustness, overlooking correlations among anatomical structures of multiple organs. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Organ FOundation (MOFO) model for universal US image segmentation. The MOFO is optimized jointly from multiple organs across various anatomical regions to overcome the data scarcity and explore correlations between multiple organs. The MOFO extracts organ-invariant representations from US images. Simultaneously, the task prompt is employed to refine organ-specific representations for segmentation predictions. Moreover, the anatomical prior is incorporated to enhance the consistency of the anatomical structures. A multi-organ US database, comprising 7039 images from 10 organs across various regions of the human body, has been established to evaluate our model. Results demonstrate that the MOFO outperforms single-organ methods in terms of the Dice coefficient, 95% Hausdorff distance and average symmetric surface distance with statistically sufficient margins. Our experiments in multi-organ universal segmentation for US images serve as a pioneering exploration of improving segmentation performance by leveraging semantic and anatomical relationships within US images of multiple organs.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable progress in medical image segmentation. However, the lesion segmentation remains a challenge to state-of-the-art CNN-based algorithms due to the variance in scales and shapes. On the one hand, tiny lesions are hard to delineate precisely from the medical images which are often of low resolutions. On the other hand, segmenting large-size lesions requires large receptive fields, which exacerbates the first challenge. In this article, we present a scale-aware super-resolution (SR) network to adaptively segment lesions of various sizes from low-resolution (LR) medical images. Our proposed network contains dual branches to simultaneously conduct lesion mask SR (LMSR) and lesion image SR (LISR). Meanwhile, we introduce scale-aware dilated convolution (SDC) blocks into the multitask decoders to adaptively adjust the receptive fields of the convolutional kernels according to the lesion sizes. To guide the segmentation branch to learn from richer high-resolution (HR) features, we propose a feature affinity (FA) module and a scale affinity (SA) module to enhance the multitask learning of the dual branches. On multiple challenging lesion segmentation datasets, our proposed network achieved consistent improvements compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Automatically generating video background music mitigates the inefficiency and time-consuming drawbacks of current manual video editing. Two key challenges hinder the expansion of the inception of video-to-music tasks. 1) Limited availability of high-quality videoâmusic datasets and annotations. 2) Absence of music generation methods that consider actual musicality, which are controlled by interpretable factors based on music theory. In the article, we propose video echoed in harmony (VEH), a method for learning and sampling video-integrated chord progression sequences. Our approach adopts harmony, represented by chord progressions that are aligned with various music formats [musical instrument digital interface (MIDI), audio, and score], imitating chord precedence in human music composition. Visual-language models link visual features to chord progressions through genre labels and descriptive words in generated textualized videos. The two aforementioned features collectively obviate the necessity of extensive videoâmusic paired data. Besides, an energy-based chord progression learning and sampling algorithm quantifies abstract harmony impressions to statistical features, serving as interpretable factors for the controllable music generation based on music theory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, producing a superior music alignment for the given video.",

    "abstract": "Masked image modeling (MIM) has been considered as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised learning (SSL) technique in terms of visual pretraining. The impressive generalization ability of MIM also paves the way for the remarkable success of large-scale vision foundation models. In this article, we further discuss the validity and advantages of implementing MIM techniques in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) and we associate the analysis with a novel MIM method named R-MIM (short for RKHS-MIM). Through the careful construction of an augmentation graph and by using spectral decomposition techniques, we establish a systematic theoretical understanding between the proposed R-MIMâs generalization ability and the choice of kernel function used during training. Specifically, we reach a conclusion that both of the local Lipschitz constant of the resultant R-MIM model and the corresponding expected pretraining error can have a strong composite effect on bounding downstream task error, depending on the kernel options. We demonstrate that under mild mathematical assumptions, R-MIM method is guaranteed to return a lower bound on downstream tasks in comparison to vanilla MIM techniques, such as masked autoencoder (MAE) and SimMIM. Empirical justification well corroborates our theoretical hypothesis and analysis in showing the superior generalization of the proposed R-MIM and the theoretical link to kernel choices.

    "abstract": "Recently, considerable research has been focused on multi-agent reinforcement learning to effectively account for each agent's relations. However, most research has focused on homogeneous multi-agent systems with the same type of agents, which has limited application to heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The demand for heterogeneous systems has considerably increased not only in games but also in the real world. Therefore, a technique that can properly consider relations in heterogeneous systems is required. In this study, we propose a novel transformer network called HRformer , which is based on heterogeneous graph networks that can reflect the heterogeneity and relations among agents. To this end, we design an effective linear encoding method for the transformer to receive input of the various and unique characteristics of the agents and introduce a novel encoding method to model the relations among them. Experiments are conducted in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment, the most famous heterogeneous multi-agent simulation, to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other existing methods in various heterogeneous scenarios. The proposed method in our simulation shows a high win rate and fast convergence speed, proving the superiority of the proposed method considering the heterogeneity of the multi-agent system.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in continual semantic segmentation ( CSS ), they still rely on the pixel-level annotation to train models, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Continual learning from image-level labels is an emerging scheme in continual semantic segmentation to reduce the annotation cost. However, the incomplete and coarse pseudo-labels are insufficient to train a model to maintain a balance between stability and plasticity. To solve these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end framework based on Transformer, called L2A, for Weakly Supervised Continual Semantic Segmentation ( WSCSS ). In particular, to generate reliable annotations from the image-level supervision, we introduce a semantic affinity from multi-head self-attention (SA-MHSA) module to capture the semantic relationships among adjacent image coordinates. Subsequently, this acquired semantic affinity is employed to refine the initial pseudo labels of new classes trained with the image-level annotations. Furthermore, to minimize catastrophic forgetting, we propose a semantic drift compensation (SDC) strategy to optimize the pseudo-label generation process, which can effectively improve the alignment of object boundaries across both new and old categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework in existing WSCSS scenarios and a newly proposed challenge protocol, as well as remains competitive compared to the pixel-level supervised CSS methods.",

    "abstract": "In decentralized machine learning over a network of workers, each worker updates its local model as a weighted average of its local model and all models received from its neighbors. Efficient consensus weight matrix design and communication resource allocation can increase the training convergence rate and reduce the wall-clock training time. In this paper, we jointly consider these two factors and propose a novel algorithm termed Communication-Efficient Network Topology (CENT), which reduces the latency in each training iteration by removing unnecessary communication links. CENT enforces communication graph sparsity by iteratively updating, with a fixed step size, a trade-off factor between the convergence factor and a weighted graph sparsity. We further extend CENT to one with an adaptive step size (CENT-A), which adjusts the trade-off factor based on the feedback of the objective function value, without introducing additional computation complexity. We show that both CENT and CENT-A preserve the training convergence rate while avoiding the selection of poor communication links. Numerical studies with real-world machine learning data in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of CENT and CENT-A and their performance advantage over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Malicious URLs present significant threats to businesses, such as transportation and banking, causing disruptions in business operations. It is essential to identify these URLs; however, existing Machine Learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small portion of the training data labels, such as Label Flipping, which can lead to misclassification. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate defense mechanisms into machine-learning models to protect against such attacks. The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify machine-learning models against adversarial threats within the machine-learning domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site URL datasets and showed that label-flipping attacks can be addressed using our proposed defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the Label Flipping attack achieved an Attack Success Rate between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative defense method successfully detected poisoned labels with an accuracy of up to 100%.",

    "abstract": "While interest in the field of explainable agents increases, it is still an open problem to incorporate a proactive explanation component into a real-time humanâagent collaboration. Thus, when collaborating with a human, we want to enable an agent to identify critical moments requiring timely explanations. We differentiate between situations requiring explanations about the agent's decision-making and assistive explanations supporting the user. In order to detect these situations, we analyze eye tracking signals of participants engaging in a collaborative virtual cooking scenario. Firstly, we show how users' gaze patterns differ between moments of user confusion, the agent making errors, and the user successfully collaborating with the agent. Secondly, we evaluate different state-of-the-art models on the task of predicting whether the user is confused or the agent makes errors using gaze- and task-related data. An ensemble of MiniRocket classifiers performs best, especially when updating its predictions with high frequency based on input samples capturing time windows of 3 to 5 seconds. We find that gaze is a significant predictor of when and what to explain. Gaze features are crucial to our classifier's accuracy, with task-related features benefiting the classifier to a smaller extent.",

    "abstract": "There is a direct correlation between noise and human health, while negative consequences may vary from sleep disruption and stress to hearing loss and reduced productivity. Despite its undeniable relevance, the underlying process governing the relationship between unpleasant sound events, and the annoyance they may cause has not been systematically studied yet. In this context, this work focuses on the disturbance caused by inter-floor sound events, i.e. the audio signals transmitted through the floors of a building. Activities such as walking, running, using household appliances or other daily actions generate sounds that can be heard by those on an adjacent floor. To this end, we implemented a suitable dataset including diverse inter-floor sound events annotated according to the perceived disturbance. Subsequently, we propose a framework able to quantify similarities exhibited by inter-floor sound events starting from standardized time-frequency representations, which are processed by a Siamese Neural Network composed of a series of convolutional layers. Such similarities are then employed by a k-medoids regression scheme making disturbance predictions based on inter-floor sound events with neighbouring latent representations. After thorough experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of such a framework and its superiority over popular regression algorithms. Last but not least, the proposed solution offers interpretable predictions, which may be meaningfully utilized by human experts.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence is beneficial in converting opaque machine learning models into transparent ones and outlining how each one makes decisions in the healthcare industry. To comprehend the variables that affect decision-making regarding diabetes prediction that can be accounted for by model-agnostic techniques. In this project, we investigate how to generate local and global explanations for a machine-learning model built on a logistic regression architecture. We trained on 253,680 survey responses from diabetes patients using the explainable AI techniques LIME and SHAP. LIME and SHAP were then used to explain the predictions produced by the logistic regression and Random forest-based model on the validation and test sets.With a discussion of future work, the comparative analysis and discussion of various experimental findings between LIME and SHAP are provided, along with their strengths and weaknesses in terms of interpretation. With a high accuracy of 86% on the test set, we used LR architecture with a spatial attention mechanism, demonstrating the possibility of merging machine learning and explainable AI to improve diabetes prediction, diagnosis, and treatment.We also focus on various applications, difficulties, and probable future directions of machine learning models for LIME and SHAP interpreters.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders show a rapid increase and cause considerable harm to individuals as well as the society in recent decade. Hence, mental disorders have become a serious public health challenge in nowadays society. Timely treatment of mental disorders plays a critical role for reducing the harm of mental illness to individuals and society. Music therapy is a type of non-pharmaceutical method in treating such mental disorders. However, conventional music therapy suffers from a number of issues resulting in a lack of popularity. Thanks to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the AI Generated Content (AIGC), it provides a chance to address these issues. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work investigating music therapy from AIGC and closed-loop perspective. In this paper, we summarise some universal music therapy methods and discuss their shortages. Then, we indicate some AIGC techniques, especially the music generation, for their application in music therapy. Moreover, we present a closed-loop music therapy system and introduce its implementation details. Finally, we discuss some challenges in AIGC-based music therapy with proposing further research direction, and we suggest the potential of this system to become a consumer-grade product for treating mental disorders.",

Users can upload full-body images to the platform, where generative AI analyzes their body shape and suggests suitable outfit options. This system addresses a significant issue in the consumer electronics industry: the frequent occurrence of mismatched clothing purchases in online shopping, which often leads to high return rates and customer dissatisfaction. By providing personalized and accurate fashion recommendations, our system aims to bridge the gap between online and physical shopping experiences. The method utilizes GenAI to recognize and interpret body shapes, ensuring that the recommended outfits match the user's physique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in accurately identifying body shapes and offering tailored fashion advice. This innovation not only improves user satisfaction by reducing the likelihood of returns but also contributes to resource conservation by minimizing the amount of unused clothing.",

    "abstract": "Todayâs Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) landscape is the product of a long history of ever-changing Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and attempts to explain it. It can be vast and confusing. Our historical reconstruction of XAI developments relates AI improvements to their inevitable impact on explanation research. The reconstruction provides the basis for an analysis of the state of XAI and for discussing its future developments in our paper and in general. We then propose a new taxonomy based on this historical reconstruction and current XAI approaches. It is a balanced mixture of detail and general applicability. It is therefore intended to be useful in a wide variety of contexts. The flowchart inspired nature of our taxonomy relates its dimensions not only to the XAI development process, but also to each other, creating an additional layer of structure. Given the historical reconstruction and our taxonomy, we are able to propose three principles: Computing Edges, Di...",

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks are envisioned to support both sensing and artificial intelligence (AI) services. However, conventional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks may not be suitable due to the ignorance of diverse task-specific data utilities in different AI applications. In this letter, a full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless network providing sensing and edge learning services is investigated. To maximize the learning performance while ensuring sensing quality, a convergence-guaranteed iterative algorithm is developed to jointly determine the uplink time allocation, as well as UAV trajectory and transmit power. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines and demonstrate the critical tradeoff between sensing and learning performance.",

    "abstract": "Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in healthcare systems of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), aiding in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of various diseases. With the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in medical image analysis, there is a growing need for transparency and trustworthiness in decision-making. This study explores the application of explainable AI (XAI) in the context of medical image analysis within medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) to enhance transparency and trustworthiness. To this end, this study proposes an explainable framework that integrates machine learning and knowledge reasoning. The explainability of the model is realized when the framework evolution target feature results and reasoning results are the same and are relatively reliable. However, using these technologies also presents new challenges, including the need to ensure the security and privacy of patient data from IoMT. Therefore, attack detection is an essential aspect of MCPS security. For the MCPS model with only sensor attacks, the necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting attacks are given based on the definition of sparse observability. The corresponding attack detector and state estimator are designed by assuming that some IoMT sensors are under protection. It is expounded that the IoMT sensors under protection play an important role in improving the efficiency of attack detection and state estimation. The experimental results show that the XAI in the context of medical image analysis within MCPS improves the accuracy of lesion classification, effectively removes low-quality medical images, and realizes the explainability of recognition results. This helps doctors understand the logic of the system's decision-making and can choose whether to trust the results based on the explanation given by the framework.",

    "abstract": "The globalized semiconductor supply chain significantly increases the risk of exposing System-on-Chip (SoC) designs to hardware Trojans. While machine learning (ML) based Trojan detection approaches are promising due to their scalability as well as detection accuracy, ML-based methods themselves are vulnerable from Trojan attacks. In this paper, we propose a robust backdoor attack on ML-based Trojan detection algorithms to demonstrate this serious vulnerability. The proposed framework is able to design an AI Trojan and implant it inside the ML model that can be triggered by specific inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AI Trojans can bypass state-of-the-art defense algorithms. Moreover, our approach provides a fast and cost-effective solution in achieving 100% attack success rate that outperforms state-of-the art methods based on adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "For the challenges posed by Internet rigidity, network virtualization (NV) technology emerges as a pivotal approach, imparting diversity, resilience, and scalability to the evolution of new Internet architecture. By abstraction, allocation, and isolation, the physical network is enabled to host multiple heterogeneous virtual networks (VNs), thereby facilitating the accommodation of user-customized requirements to share physical resources. Nevertheless, a critical challenge in NV implementation is the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem, which concerns the efficient allocation of physical network resources to VNs. In recent years, researchers have increasingly focused on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment VNE with heightened intelligence, efficiency, dynamics, and interactivity. Therefore, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of AI-empowered VNE algorithms, presenting insights into the general modeling, definition processes, and applications of the fundamental VNE paradigm. Furthermore, an exhaustive taxonomy is presented, encompassing categories such as single-domain/multi-domain, centralized/distributed, online/offline, coordinated/uncoordinated, dynamic/ static, and survivable/unsurvivable. Subsequently, for the prevailing mainstream methods of VNE, reinforcement learning (RL)-based and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based, a comprehensive review and comparative analysis of the latest works are conducted within the delineated taxonomy. Finally, the open issues, research challenges, and opportunities for VNE in future settings are identified. In particular, the significant role and key bottlenecks in the urgent vision of satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) for the 6th generation (6G) communications. This survey is expected to provide comprehensive information, guide scientific research, illuminate frontier trends, and establish the theoretical basis for further research.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal signals, including text, audio, image, and video, can be integrated into semantic communication (SC) systems to provide an immersive experience with low latency and high quality at the semantic level. However, the multimodal SC has several challenges, including data heterogeneity, semantic ambiguity, and signal distortion during transmission. Recent advancements in large AI models, particularly in the multimodal language model (MLM) and large language model (LLM), offer potential solutions for addressing these issues. To this end, we propose a large AI model-based multimodal SC (LAM-MSC) framework, where we first present the MLMbased multimodal alignment (MMA) that utilizes the MLM to enable the transformation between multimodal and unimodal data while preserving semantic consistency. Then, a personalized LLM-based knowledge base (LKB) is proposed, which allows users to perform personalized semantic extraction or recovery through the LLM. This effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity. Finally, we apply the conditional generative adversarial networks-based channel estimation (CGE) for estimating the wireless channel state information. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of fading channels in SC. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the superior performance of the LAM-MSC framework.",

    "abstract": "The surge in global car ownership and the largescale popularization of new Electric Vehicles (EVs) have precipitated significant challenges in parking space allocation and charging infrastructure worldwide. Automated Valet Parking and Charging (AVPC) systems have emerged as the key to surmounting the aforementioned pain points. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have catalyzed transformative developments in optimization strategies within AVP frameworks. This article proposes a novel layered and collaborative AI-empowered AVPC architecture for optimal and efficient automated parking and charging in parking areas. Our discourse delves into three key modules integral to the proposed architecture: High Definition (HD) map generation and updating, interactive vehicle-infrastructure collaborative sensing, and multi-vehicle global scheduling. These key modules are interwoven to facilitate seamless interaction among entities in the architecture, augmenting efficient EV parking and charging. Simulation- based evaluation analyzes the impact of the modular architecture in AVPC scenarios, demonstrating the efficiency of its key modules.",

    "abstract": "Radio access networks have recently witnessed impressive strides thanks to numerous cutting-edge technologies including network slicing. While these improvements are expected to continue, optimal end-to-end network slicing requires an accurate abstraction of the core network. To properly meet the challenges associated with next-generation networks and services, research and standard organizations envision a revolutionary redesign from the ground up where artificial intelligence will no longer simply be an overlaid service but rather be the foundation upon which all core network functions natively run, i.e., AI-Native. In this first-of-a-kind work, we optimize end-to-end network slicing while considering the 3GPP core network functions and workloads by solving a holistic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize the end-to-end latency. Due to its complexity, we decompose it into two sequential problems: a convex access-end problem and an integer linear programming core network-end problem, the latter of which is solved by AI-Native at the core network. Finally, we discuss our extensive simulation results to validate our approach.",

    "abstract": "The novel nonvolatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) technology enables data to be stored and processed in situ, providing a feasible solution for the widespread deployment of machine learning algorithms in edge AI devices. However, current nvCIM approaches based on weighted current summation face challenges such as device nonidealities and substantial time, storage, and energy overheads when handling high-precision analog signals. To address these issues, we propose a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based binary convolution macro for constructing a complete binary convolutional neural network (BCNN) hardware circuit, accelerating edge AI applications with low-weight precision. This macro performs error compensation at the circuit level and provides stable rail-to-rail output, eliminating the need for any ADCs or processor to perform auxiliary computations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BCNN full-hardware computing system achieves on-chip recognition accuracy of 90.7% (98.64%) on the CIFAR10 (MNIST) dataset, which represents a decrease of 0.98% (0.59%) compared to software recognition accuracy. In addition, this binary convolution macro achieves a maximum throughput of 320 GOPS and a peak energy efficiency of 578 TOPS/W at 136 MHz.",

    "abstract": "Urban planning faces complex challenges, including efficient resource allocation, traffic management, and infrastructure optimization. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing these multifaceted issues, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Simulated Annealing (SA) to tackle these challenges in urban planning. GNNs are employed to extract meaningful features and relationships from urban infrastructure and social networks, providing a detailed understanding of patterns and interactions. SA is then used to optimize resource allocation, traffic routing, and scheduling tasks based on the insights derived from GNNs. This hybrid methodology allows for an iterative refinement process, where updated features from GNNs continuously enhance the optimization performed by SA. Key findings of the study reveal significant improvements. Traffic congestion was reduced by 25%, and average travel times decreased by 18%. Resource allocation efficiency improved by 30%, with a 20% reduction in resource wastage. Infrastructure optimization metrics showed a 22% gain in cost efficiency and a 15% increase in accessibility. The combined GNN-SA approach proved effective in addressing urban planning inefficiencies and optimizing various aspects of smart city management. The contributions of this study include a robust framework for integrating advanced AI techniques to solve complex urban planning problems, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for modern smart cities. The results highlight the potential of hybrid AI approaches in enhancing urban planning and provide a foundation for future research and application in this field.",

    "abstract": "Currently, generative AI has garnered substantial attention due to the limited defect samples in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, addressing the challenge of few-shot defect detection in industrial edge networks remains a key issue. In this paper, we propose ABEL, a novel AI-generated content (AIGC)-driven edge learning framework for fast and efficient few-shot defect detection. This framework facilitates fast few-shot defect detection by harnessing the capabilities of realistic sample synthesis and edge-based AIGC task execution. Specifically, we propose an energy-based model (EBM)guided Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo (L-MCMC) image generation algorithm, to synthesize high-resolution industrial defect samples for efficient few-shot defect detection. Then, we formulate a large-scale mixed cooperative-competitive AIGC computation offloading problem and propose an attention and memory-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMMARL) algorithm to ensure fast edge execution of heterogeneous defect samples generative tasks. Particularly, the challenges of partial observability and high-dimensional state space are addressed by introducing multi-head attention mechanisms and long-term memory modules. Comprehensive synthesis experiments are conducted utilizing real-world industrial datasets NEU-CLS and DeepPCB. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and algorithm in the efficient synthesis of realistic industrial defect images and the optimization of edgebased AIGC task execution",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) offers a paradigm for the security authentication of the satellite component in automatic identification system (SAT-AIS). This paper proposes a data-driven RFFI solution for SAT-AIS with multiple communication scenarios. Conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) embedded with channel estimation can generate numerous realistic samples for data augmentation. Both the generator and the discriminator in CGANs employ deep neural networks to adaptively extract RFF features thus enhancing the robustness of this system. Moreover, in light of the dilemma of collecting large datasets, Bayesian meta-learning via variational autoencoder is performed for model training to enable few-shot learning, where only a small number of samples are required to complete the inference for efficient RFFI in multi-scenario communications. Experimental results show that the proposed RFFI framework outperforms existing methods by achieving up to 97.30% accuracy on datasets with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 10dB.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence methods are being increasingly applied across various domains, but their often opaque nature has raised concerns about accountability and trust. In response, the field of explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address the need for human-understandable AI systems. Evolutionary computation (EC), a family of powerful optimization and learning algorithms, offers significant potential to contribute to XAI, and vice versa. This paper provides an introduction to XAI and reviews current techniques for explaining machine learning models. We then explore how EC can be leveraged in XAI and examine existing XAI approaches that incorporate EC techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the application of XAI principles within EC itself, investigating how these principles can illuminate the behavior and outcomes of EC algorithms, their (automatic) configuration, and the underlying problem landscapes they optimize. Finally, we discuss open challenges in XAI and highlight opportunities for future research at the intersection of XAI and EC. Our goal is to demonstrate ECâs suitability for addressing current explainability challenges and to encourage further exploration of these methods, ultimately contributing to the development of more understandable and trustworthy ML models and EC algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a classification system for arrhythmias, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the diagnostic process for cardiologists. The proposed algorithm includes a naive preprocessing procedure for electrocardiography (ECG) data applicable to various ECG databases. Additionally, this work proposes an ultralightweight model for arrhythmia classification based on a convolutional neural network and incorporating R-peak interval features to represent long-term rhythm information, thereby improving the model's classification performance. The proposed model is trained and tested by using the MIT-BIH and NCKU-CBIC databases in accordance with the classification standards of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), achieving high accuracies of 98.32% and 97.1%. This work applies the arrhythmia classification algorithm to a web-based system, thus providing a graphical interface. The cloud-based execution of automated artificial intelligence (AI) classification allows cardiologists and patients to view ECG wave conditions instantly, thereby remarkably enhancing the quality of medical examination. This work also designs a customized integrated circuit for the hardware implementation of an AI accelerator. The accelerator utilizes a parallelized processing element array architecture to perform convolution and fully connected layer operations. It introduces proposed hybrid stationary techniques, combining input and weight stationary modes to increase data reuse drastically and reduce hardware execution cycles and power consumption, ultimately achieving high-performance computing. This accelerator is implemented in the form of a chip by using the TSMC 180 nm CMOS process. It exhibits a power consumption of 122 Î¼W, a classification latency of 6.8 ms, and an energy efficiency of 0.83 Î¼J/classification.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge guidance is crucial for bridging the gap between high-level AI ethics principles and the practical implementation of responsible AI systems. Diverging from static knowledge inference and temporal interpolation, the task of temporal knowledge extrapolation, which entails predicting future facts based on the evolution of historical facts, poses formidable challenges that remain largely unsolved. In existing temporal extrapolation methods, the structural learning of concurrent facts is primarily addressed by utilizing relation-aware graph neural networks. However, the temporal validity of facts leads to the sparsity of temporal subgraphs, where inherent coarse-level learning mechanisms hinder the capture of nuanced and scarce local semantics. Thus, this paper proposes a fine-grained tensor graph attention network (F-GAT) that promotes representation learning of concurrent facts on sparse subgraphs by effectively distinguishing the significance of entities and relations within tr...",

    "abstract": "Recently, applications using artificial intelligence (AI) technique in mobile devices such as augmented reality have been extensively pervasive. The hardware specifications of mobile devices, dynamic service demands, stochastic network states, and characteristics of DNN (Deep Neural Network) models affect the quality of experience (QoE) of such applications. In this paper, we propose CutEdge , that leverages a virtual queue-based Lyapunov optimization framework to jointly optimize DNN model partitioning between a mobile device and a mobile edge computing (MEC) server and processing/networking resources in a mobile device with respect to internal/external system dynamics. Specifically, CutEdge makes decisions of (i) the partition point of DNN model between the mobile device and MEC server, (ii) GPU clock frequency, and (iii) transmission rates in a mobile device, simultaneously. Then, we theoretically show the optimal trade-off curves among energy consumption, throughput, and end-to-end latency yielded by CutEdge where such QoE metrics have not been jointly addressed in the previous studies. Moreover, we show the impact of joint optimization of three control parameters on the performances via real trace-driven simulations. Finally, we show the superiority of CutEdge over the existing algorithms by experiment on top of implemented testbed using an embedded AI device and an MEC server.",

    "abstract": "Advancement of the Internet has increased security risks associated with data protection and online shopping. Several techniques compromise Internet security, including hacking, SQL injection, phishing attacks, and DNS tunneling. Phishing attacks are particularly significant among web phishing techniques. In a phishing attack, the attacker creates a fake website that closely resembles a legitimate one to deceive users into providing sensitive information. These attacks can be detected using both traditional and modern AI-based models. However, even with state-of-the-art methods, accurately classifying newly emerged links as phishing or legitimate remains a challenge. This study conducts a comparative analysis of more than 130 articles published between 2020 and 2024, identifying challenges and gaps in the literature and comparing the findings of various authors. The novelty of this research lies in providing a roadmap for researchers, practitioners, and cybersecurity experts to navigate the landscape of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for phishing detection. The study reviews traditional phishing detection methods, ML and DL models, phishing datasets, and the step-by-step phishing process. It highlights limitations, research gaps, weaknesses, and potential improvements. Accuracy measures are used to compare model performance. In conclusion, this research provides a comprehensive survey of website phishing detection using AI models, offering a new roadmap for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions deployed in the environment of space-air-ground integrated vehicular networks (SAGVNs) are instrumental in achieving efficient coordination between connected electric vehicles (EVs) and distributed networks. This study addresses this challenge by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) based hybrid dispatching framework for formulating dispatching strategies, where the need for commonsense understanding by EV drivers is paramount. This paper proposes a framework LLM-D3PG, LLM-guided dual Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, which empowers EV drivers to articulate their expectations for AI-generated dispatching strategies using natural language instructions. These instructions serve as guidance for the generation of dispatching strategies within complex distributed network scenarios. According to this strategy, the proposed framework seamlessly integrates the decision-making capabilities of LLM with multiple D3PG models to generate a large number of candidate dispatching strategies and then uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize these strategies to achieve better dispatching results. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show outperformance in comparison to some existing methods for power dispatching tasks with the random connection of EVs in SAGVNs.",

We outline design principles for model generalization in three key domains: environment for robustness, intents for adaptability to system objectives, and control tasks for reducing AI-driven control loops. Adopting these principles can decrease the number of models deployed and increase adaptability in diverse radio communication environments. To address the challenges of model generalization in communication systems, we propose a learning architecture that leverages centralization of training and data management functionalities, combined with distributed data generation. We illustrate these concepts by designing a generalized link adaptation algorithm, demonstrating the benefits of our proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Remote healthcare monitoring is a crucial component in the field of medical Internet of Things (IoT), which effectively achieves remote monitoring, collection, and transmission of physiological data by combining AI algorithms with intelligent health monitoring systems to improve peopleâs quality of life and health. In this work, an AI-enabled scalable smartphone photonic sensing system is developed for remote healthcare monitoring using fiber optic sensors and a smartphone. The smartphone serves as both the light source and interrogator for the system, with the ability to connect to the network for integration with the IoT. Scalability is achieved through a multi-channel framework, and by modifying the connector design, the system can incorporate more sensors to monitor multiple physiological parameters in real-time. In addition to acquiring basic respiratory and heartbeat signals and various gait parameters, the system successfully implemented the recognition of various gait patterns and fatigue monitoring using an adapted MobileNetV3 neural network structure. The accuracy of 98.5% for the gait pattern recognition task, and 94% and 95.8% for the mental and muscle fatigue monitoring tasks, respectively, demonstrates the systemâs potential as a telemedicine tool. Additionally, the low cost, non-invasiveness, and portability of this innovative sensor system make it highly generalizable.",

    "abstract": "The application of aerial refueling technology to UAVs can reduce the dependence on the pilotâs operation, which has unique advantages in carrying out battlefield reconnaissance, monitoring suspicious targets and collecting intelligence through all-weather work. The existing vision-based drogue detection methods are assumed to be carried out under daily lighting conditions, but special weather, such as fog, makes it difficult to identify the characteristics of the drogue, which will greatly degrade the model performance or even fail. Moreover, the traditional computing architecture is difficult to be directly applied to real airborne equipment, so it is necessary to adopt AI processor module with faster and better computing power and supporting parallel computing to meet the requirements of low delay and high security in aerial refueling. Therefore, this work proposes a robust detection network based on image domain adaption. Firstly, an end-to-end image defogging module is designed to deal with foggy image enhancement under weak supervision. Then, knowledge distillation with the teacher-student network is applied to guide the student model to obtain the instance-level features of the unlabeled target domain. In addition, the detection model is compiled and transplanted on the system-on-chip chip of JFMQL100TAI. The comprehensive experimental results on public datasets and real refueling datasets validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed work, which effectively complements the drogue detection of special autonomous aerial refueling tasks. Note to Practitioners âAs a widely used refueling technology in the field of national defense, probe-and-drogue refueling has developed from manual control docking to monitoring auxiliary docking. However, it is difficult for pilots to accurately and quickly obtain the relative position of the refueling drogue through visual perception. In this work, a semi-supervised drogue detection network for special aerial re...",

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a spectrum of comprehensive neurodevelopment disorder that leads to speech impairments, repetitive behavior, and social communication difficulties; therefore, it is imperative to underscore that at the core of all impediments are communication impairment. This article represents a systematic review of research initiatives that investigate multi-modal AAC strategies and functionality, features of mobile applications to reinforce communication and communal skills in verbally challenged ASD children because other researches are focused only on low or high-tech AAC or interventions to provide insights on ASD children respond to a particular approach. Following the PRISMA method, a total of 60 (January 2015 to October 2020) research articles were reviewed, indexed by Springer, Science Direct, Scopus, ACM, IEEE databases, and published in the AAC journal. The selected research articles are categorized into different themes where most of them focused on interactive mobile applications to improve emotional, social, learning, and overall communication skills in verbally challenged ASD children. This systematic review provides an outline of the paradigm shift in AAC modalities from PECS to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Augmented Reality (AR) based applications. It opens up underline future opportunities to integrate intelligent analytics features in mobile applications to strengthen communication skills in verbally undermined ASD children.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to make a plan (i.e. a sequence of actions) given the current visual observation and the desired goal. Previous works cast this as a sequence modeling problem and leverage either intermediate visual observations or language instructions as supervision to make autoregressive planning, resulting in complex learning schemes and expensive annotation costs. To avoid intermediate supervision annotation and error accumulation caused by planning autoregressively, we propose a diffusion-based framework, coined as PDPP (Projected Diffusion model for Procedure Planning), to directly model the whole action sequence distribution with task label as supervision instead. Our core idea is to treat procedure planning as a distribution fitting problem under the given observations, thus transform the planning problem to a sampling process from this distribution during inference. The diffusion-based modeling approach also effectively addresses the uncertainty issue in procedure planning. Based on PDPP, we further apply joint training to our framework to generate plans with varying horizon lengths using a single model and reduce the number of training parameters required. We instantiate our PDPP with three popular diffusion models and investigate a serious of condition-introducing methods in our framework, including condition embeddings, Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), two-stage prediction and Classifier-Free Guidance strategy. Finally, we apply our PDPP to the Visual Planners for human Assistance (VPA) problem which requires the goal specified in natural language rather than visual observation. We conduct experiments on challenging datasets of different scales and our PDPP model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, even compared with those strongly-supervised counterparts. These results further demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our model. Code and...",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-and performance-efficient tools that have been found to be very useful in AI applications at the edge. This paper introduces SYNtzulu, an SNN processing element designed to be used in low-cost and low-power FPGA devices for near-sensor data analysis. The system is equipped with a RISC-V subsystem responsible for controlling the input/output and setting runtime parameters, thus increasing its flexibility. We evaluated the system, which was implemented on a Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA, in various use cases employing SNNs with accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. SYNtzulu dissipates a maximum power of 12.05 mW when performing SNN inference, which can be reduced to an average of just 1.45 mW through the use of dynamic power management.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication is viewed as a revolutionary paradigm that can potentially transform how we design and operate wireless communication systems. However, despite a recent surge of research activities in this area, remarkably, the research landscape is still limited in at least three ways. First and foremost, the definition of a âsemantic communication system\" is ambiguous and varies widely between different studies. This lack of consensus makes it challenging to develop rigorous and scalable frameworks for building semantic communication networks. Secondly, current approaches to building semantic communication networks are limited by their reliance on data-driven and information-driven AI-augmented networks. These networks remain âtied\" to the data, which limits their ability to perform versatile logic. In contrast, knowledge-driven and reasoning-driven AI-native networks would allow for more flexible and powerful communication capabilities. However, there is currently a lack of technical foundations to support such networks. Thirdly, the concept of âsemantic representation\" is not well understood yet, and its role in embedding meaning and structure in data transferred across wireless network is still a subject of active research. The development of semantic representations that are minimalist, generalizable, and efficient is critical to enabling the transmitter and receiver to generate content via a minimally semantic representation. To address these limitations, in this tutorial, we propose the first rigorous and holistic vision of an end-to-end semantic communication network that is founded on novel concepts from artificial intelligence (AI), causal reasoning, transfer learning, and minimum description length theory. We first discuss how the design of semantic communication networks requires a move from data-driven AI-augmented networks, in which wireless networks remain âtied\" to data, towards reasoning-driven AI-native networks which can perform versatile ...",

    "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks will feature the widespread deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms at the network edge, which provides a platform for supporting robotic edge intelligence systems. In such a system, a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) is operated at an edge server as a âremote brainâ to guide remote robots on environmental exploration or task execution. In this paper, we present a new air-interface framework targeting the said systems, called knowledge-based robotic semantic communications (SemCom), which consists of a protocol and relevant transmission techniques. First, the proposed robotic SemCom protocol defines a sequence of system operations for executing a given robotic task. They include identification of all task-relevant knowledge paths (KPs) on the KG, semantic matching between KG and object classifier, and uploading of robotâs observations for objects recognition and feasible KP identification. Next, to support ultra-low-latency (observation) feature transmission (ULL-FT), we propose a novel transmission approach that exploits classifierâs robustness, which is measured by classification margin , to compensate for a high bit error probability (BEP) resulting from ultra-low-latency transmission (e.g., short packet and/or no coding). By utilizing the tractable Gaussian mixture (GM) model, we mathematically derive the relation between BEP and classification margin under constraints on classification accuracy and transmission latency. The result sheds light on system requirements to support ULL-FT. Furthermore, for the case where the classification margin is insufficient for coping with channel distortion, we enhance the ULL-FT approach by studying retransmission and multi-view classification for enlarging the margin and further quantifying corresponding requirements. Finally, experiments using deep neural networks as classifier models and real datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of ULL...",

    "abstract": "Generative AI is revolutionizing Software Engineering (SE), as both engineers and academics embrace this technology in their work. To better leverage this technology for software generation, it is essential to propose effective IoT software defect prediction methods. However, this task is challenging due to the unclear high-order correlation underlying the data. Moreover, in real-world IoT software defect prediction applications, different types of misclassifications generally lead to distinct losses and associated costs. However, accurately determining these specific costs is often not feasible. Under such circumstances, we propose a cost-sensitive hypergraph learning method with structure quality preservation (csHLQ) to optimize the cost information and preserve the graph quality in a principled way. Due to the representational ability on high-order relationship exploring, we employ hypergraph structure instead of graph structure to model the complex correlations among the datasets. We note that if a cost-sensitive hypergraph has a high quality, its classification results may exhibit a large margin separation. Thus, csHLQ exploits the large margin cost-sensitive hypergraph while avoiding using of a cost-sensitive hypergraph with a small margin. To measure the performance of our proposed method, we performed experiments on three distinct groups of datasets, i.e., the NASA Metrics Data Program (NASA) dataset, CK metric dataset and UCI Machine Learning Repository (UCI) dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), with the release of several large models having only query access, make a strong case for explainability of deep models in a post-hoc gradient free manner. In this paper, we propose a framework, named distillation aided explainability (DAX), that attempts to generate a saliency-based explanation in a model agnostic gradient free application. The DAX approach poses the problem of explanation in a learnable setting with a mask generation network and a distillation network. The mask generation network learns to generate the multiplier mask that finds the salient regions of the input, while the student distillation network aims to approximate the local behavior of the black-box model. We propose a joint optimization of the two networks in the DAX framework using the locally perturbed input samples, with the targets derived from input-output access to the black-box model. We extensively evaluate DAX across different modalities (image and audio), in a classification setting, using a diverse set of evaluations (intersection over union with ground truth, deletion based and subjective human evaluation based measures) and benchmark it with respect to 9 different methods. In these evaluations, the DAX significantly outperforms the existing approaches on all modalities and evaluation metrics.",

In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "E-learning courses often suffer from high dropout rates and low student satisfaction. One way to address this issue is to use Personalized Learning Paths (PLPs), which are sequences of learning materials that meet the individual needs of students. However, creating PLPs is difficult and often involves combining knowledge graphs, student profiles, and learning materials. Researchers typically assume that the problem of creating PLPs belong to the NP-Hard class of computational problems. However, previous research in this field has neither defined the different variations of the PLP problem nor formally established their computational complexity. Without clear definitions of the PLP variations, researchers risk making invalid comparisons and conclusions when they use different metaheuristics for different PLP problems. In order to unify this conversation, this paper formally proves the NP-completeness of two common PLP variations and their generalizations and uses them to categorize rece...",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has captured remarkable interests from academia and industry. However, this advancement brings forth challenges in data ownership, as emphasized by the General Data Protection Regulationâs right to be forgotten. The right to be forgotten allows participants to erase their data contributions from well-trained AIGC models. Training AIGC models demands an extensive amount of data and computations, often surpassing the capabilities of individual participants. As a solution, Federated Learning (FL) is employed to collaboratively train an AIGC model without sharing raw data directly. To protect the right to be forgotten in FL, âfederated unlearningâ has been introduced to eradicate the data contributions of unlearning participants from fully trained AIGC models, achieved by deleting historical model updates. However, given that historical updates are distributed among various participants, they may still hold contributions from the unlearning participants. This presents a challenge to the trustworthiness of federated unlearning. In this paper, we first provide an overview of both centralized and federated learning and unlearning methods. We survey relevant works and classify four main categories for federated unlearning. Subsequently, we introduce a comprehensive decentralized unlearning architecture designed for trustworthy AIGC services. To address the challenge of participants retaining historical contributions from unlearning participants, we integrate a coded computing-based interaction mechanism, ensuring both scalability and security. We further present a case study using NanoGPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for decentralized unlearning. We conclude by identifying potential future research directions.",

It highlights the transformative potential of these technologies in reshaping industries and enhancing efficiency while also underscoring the challenges they present, particularly in data protection and privacy. To put these challenges in context, a security model consisting of three dimensions (security goal, security control, and data state) is developed and applied to six sectors. The resultant models represent a major step toward more effective risk assessment in practice. They should also inspire research efforts to further advance CAB more effectively and responsibly.",

    "abstract": "A low-power artificial intelligence (AI)-based semantic LiDAR SLAM processor is proposed to expand autonomous driving into emerging mobile robots. It combines point neural network (PNN)-based 3D segmentation with LiDAR SLAM to minimize pose errors due to the lack of perception in previous SLAM. The proposed processor is designed with a heterogeneous multi-core architecture utilizing SIMD and reconfigurable processing elements to fully support the three main operations: k-nearest neighbor (kNN); PNN; and non-linear optimization. It accelerates kNN operations with spherical bin partitioning optimized for the distribution of LiDAR data to eliminate unnecessary search spaces. In addition, the proposed spatio-temporal-aware computing minimizes excessive memory overhead and workload imbalance in kNN and PNN operations. Consequently, fabricated with 28-nm CMOS technology, the processor achieves 8.245 mJ/frame of energy consumption and a maximum performance of 20.7 ms latency, successfully demonstrating real-time semantic LiDAR SLAM system with 99.86% lower power consumption compared to modern CPU+GPU platforms.",

    "abstract": "Detecting seizures in neonates requires continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring, a costly process that demands trained experts. Although recent advancements in machine learning offer promising solutions for automated seizure detection, the opaque nature of these algorithms poses significant challenges to their adoption in healthcare settings. A prior study demonstrated that integrating machine learning with sonificationâan interpretation method that converts bio-signals into soundâcan mitigate the black-box problem while enhancing seizure detection performance. This AI-assisted sonification algorithm can provide a valuable complementary tool in seizure monitoring besides the traditional visualization method. A low-power and affordable implementation of the algorithm is presented in this study using a microcontroller. To improve its practicality, we also introduce a real-time design that allows the sonification algorithm to function in parallel with data acquisition. The system consumes 12mW in average, making it suitable for a battery-powered device.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving domain of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), ensuring robust trust management, privacy, and security presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating Generative AI (GAI) and Federated Learning (FL) to address these challenges. FL allows distributed learning across vehicles without the need to share data, enhancing privacy compared to centralized methods. Our approach enhances trust management by raising the level of accuracy in detecting anomalies and preserving data privacy. As a result, the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical real-world urban settings is illustrated by comprehensive evaluations using the CityPulse dataset. The results show a 20% improvement in trust scores under normal conditions, a 92% anomaly detection accuracy, and acceptable latency despite the added security measures. Additionally, 3D visualizations illustrate the systems robustness and scalability. This solution aligns with the objectives of 6G wireless communications, laying the groundwork for future intelligent, ultra-reliable, and secure vehicular networks. Future research will focus on expanding the application of GAI and FL for real-time decision-making in large-scale IoV networks and optimizing cryptographic protocols.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of predicting hazards that drivers may encounter while driving a car. We formulate it as a task of anticipating impending accidents using a single input image captured by car dashcams. Unlike existing approaches to driving hazard prediction that rely on computational simulations or anomaly detection from videos, this study focuses on high-level inference from static images. The problem needs predicting and reasoning about future events based on uncertain observations, which falls under visual abductive reasoning. To enable research in this understudied area, a new dataset named the DHPR (Driving Hazard Prediction and Reasoning) dataset is created. The dataset consists of 15K dashcam images of street scenes, and each image is associated with a tuple containing car speed, a hypothesized hazard description, and visual entities present in the scene. These are annotated by human annotators, who identify risky scenes and provide descriptions of potential accidents that could occur a few seconds later. We present several baseline methods and evaluate their performance on our dataset, identifying remaining issues and discussing future directions. This study contributes to the field by introducing a novel problem formulation and dataset, enabling researchers to explore the potential of multi-modal AI for driving hazard prediction.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation edge intelligence is anticipated to benefit various applications via offloading techniques. However, traditional offloading architectures face several issues, including heterogeneous constraints, partial perception, uncertain generalization, and lack of tractability. In this article, we propose a large AI model-based offloading (LAMBO) framework with over one billion parameters for solving these problems. We first use input embedding (IE) to achieve normalized feature representation with heterogeneous constraints and task prompts. Then, we introduce a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder (AED) as the decision-making model, which is an improved transformer architecture consisting of a deep encoder and a shallow decoder for global perception and decision. Next, actor-critic learning (ACL) is used to pre-train the AED for different optimization tasks under corresponding prompts, enhancing the AED's generalization in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we propose an active learning from expert feedback (ALEF) method to fine-tune the decoder of the AED for tracking changes in dynamic environments. Our simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed LAMBO framework.",

    "abstract": "Network slicing is the key enabler for the 5G Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), allowing tailored services and security guarantees for vertical industries. With the advent of 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G era, the number of slices will increase significantly, leading to more diverse security requirements given different slice features. To provide adaptive security management spanning multiple slices in IIoT, this paper proposes a novel slice-specific secure IIoT (SSIOT) architecture with an AI-enabled solution. The SSIOT architecture separates the control and data planes, where the control plane orchestrates the Security Service Function Chains (SSFC) across network slices and the data plane analyzes the slice-specific features like traffic patterns, resource SLA guarantees, and Virtual Security Network Function (VSNF) dependencies. To extract these spatial-temporal features from the dynamic IIoT environments, we facilitate the powerful deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods and propose a structural GS2L approach. GS2L is maliciously designed with the core principles of graph convolutional network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), enabling a thorough understanding of physical resource distribution and the request dynamics across slices. Extensive experiments are conducted in diverse IIoT slices with the real-world USNet and fat-tree topologies. Simulation results demonstrate that GS2L outperforms state-of-the-art learning and heuristic benchmarks, showcasing an overall 15.2% improvement with efficient and stable resource utilization.",

    "abstract": "The AI-driven Internet of Things (AIoT) has been widely applied in the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for vehicular cooperation. Federated Learning (FL), due to its ability to protect usersâ data privacy, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate real-time decision-making, is widely applied in the augmented intelligence of things for vehicles (AIoV). However, integrating FL with AIoV poses challenges, including the absence of fine-grained access control, insufficient safeguards for FL tasks and vehicle identities, inadequate security for data transmission, and shortcomings in protecting data storage. These vulnerabilities may lead to risks such as vehicle tracking, model information theft, and data tampering. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy preservation mechanism for AIoV via cloud-edge-vehicle hierarchical sharding blockchain. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical anonymous authentication scheme for IoV devices with stronger scalability and higher fault tolerance. Vehicles only know the attributes of each other or which shard they belong to. Secondly, we present a secure FL task assignment scheme for AIoV. Edge nodes utilize attribute-based encryption to deploy fine-grained FL tasks based on vehicle attributes. Only users who meet the attributes can decrypt the content, protecting FL tasks content and participant identities. Thirdly, we present a secure data transmission scheme between AIoV devices to protect the identity and data privacy of both parties, while also achieving non-interactive key agreement. Additionally, we propose a scalable secure data sharing and storage scheme based on hierarchical sharding blockchain, aiming to reduce storage overhead and minimize trust costs.",

    "abstract": "To achieve high-quality and high-resolution image processing, this work presents a novel vision processor that facilitates deep learning-enhanced image processing pipelines. At the system level, by identifying that a divide-and-conquer approach is essential to synergize both classical image processing and image enhancement networks, we develop a tightly coupled system with strip-tile conversion dataflow to enable fine-grained low-latency data interactions between image signal processors (ISPs) and the deep learning accelerator (DLA). At the architecture level, we design a comprehensive set of 21 efficient image processing modules to construct classical ISP pipelines, a tile-based strip layer fusion DLA specifically optimized for networks, and a programmable pixel pool that seamlessly supports the data access patterns of the ISP and the DLA. At the software and hardware co-design level, we propose a comprehensive optimization framework to address the implementation overhead of networks while maintaining the image quality. Finally, evaluations of the AI-ISP vision processor demonstrate 53.95% external memory access reduction and 35.51% latency reduction, delivering superior image quality with minimal on-chip memory overhead. A throughput of up to 168.5 frames per second facilitates efficient processing of ultra-high definition (UHD) resolution images.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the problem of multiple sensor's intermittent faults (IFs) diagnosis is investigated for induction motor drive systems. To overcome the difficulties in locating IFs for different sensors, a set of AI predictors trained by a pair of homologous and heterogeneous datasets is built to construct residuals only sensitive to their corresponding sensor. As components of a predictor, nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) structure, random vector functional link (RVFL), and linear feedback structure are used to extract the mapping relationships between inputs and outputs. Then, based on the sliding window and the unique characteristics of predictors, a pair of decoupled residuals is constructed. After that, a threshold-based decision-making method is designed to identify the dc-link voltage sensor IFs and phase current sensor IFs. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed IFs diagnosis method are validated in a 3.3 kW experimental platform with a three-phase induction motor drive system.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel intelligent robust interaction force control method for a cardiac ultrasound robotic system (CURS), exploiting dual control loops and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven image feedback to enhance both image quality and patient safety during cardiac examinations. Unlike existing systems that use a constant interaction force, the proposed method adjusts the force based on ultrasound image feedback, which is critical for adapting to different cardiac views. The system employs an internal control loop, where the force feedback generates control commands (low-level controller), and an external control loop, where the feedback is processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN), named ultrasound-cardiac-feature-net (UCF-Net), determines the optimal force values (high-level controller). An adaptive filtered quasi-sliding mode controller (AFQSMC) manages both interaction force and probeâs position within a hybrid position/force control context, ensuring robustness against uncertainties and disturbances. Experimental evaluations on a cardiac phantom navigating main cardiac views demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional constant force control. Moreover, AFQSMC achieves significant improvements in interaction force control, with enhancements ranging from 21.87% to 68.25% over traditional FQSMC, sliding mode control (SMC), and proportional-integral (PI) controllers, across quantitative metrics such as root mean square (RMS), standard deviation (STD), and Max, confirming its potential for improving cardiac examination performance.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of communication technologies and cloud systems has led to the emergence of the Healthcare-Consumer Internet of Things (H-CIoT) as a significant domain. This emergence has transformed the traditional healthcare system into the next generation of H-CIoT, characterized by higher connectivity and intelligence. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is currently being incorporated into H-CIoT, enabling it to meet the complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous requirements of H-CIoT networks. As the H-CIoT network expands, there is an increasing demand for secure, efficient, and optimal routing to ensure low latency and high throughput. In this paper, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approach that combines the strengths of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to accurately detect anomalies in H-CIoT imbalance data and achieve optimum routing. The DRL model dynamically formulates the optimal routing policies through efficient adaptation to underlying network traffic patterns. It also comprehends the characteristics of imbalance data to enhance its routing decisions. Simulation-based results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed model over OSPF routing optimization technique in term of throughput (12%), latency (20%), and the Probability of avoiding malicious minor class attacks (30%), confirming it as an outstanding suitability for the next-generation H-CIoT network.",

To effectively address the challenges of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, this paper introduces a collaborative AI training framework that leverages generative AI to enhance the learning performance of FL. In this framework, heterogeneous edge devices (HEDs) identify specific data categories lacking in their local datasets and acquire these data from Generative AI Providers (GAPs). This strategy aims to improve the convergence rate of FL. However, HEDs and GAPs may be reluctant to contribute their resources to FL training due to self-interest. Therefore, an incentive mechanism is necessary to encourage their participation. We propose a reverse auction model to facilitate data transactions among FL training buyers, GAPs, and HEDs within the FL training buyerâs budget. It focuses on determining winners and devising payment rules to maximize the FL training buyerâs utility. This involves solving a 0-1 programming problem with two sellers (GAPs and HEDs). To tackle this, we use joint bidding and virtual seller pairs for analysis. We demonstrate that our method ensures truthfulness, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we employ a one-side matching mechanism to approximate the optimal solution. We further investigate a strategy to analyze and allocate data based on variance, aiming to minimize non-IID issues in local data. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed matching mechanism can effectively improve the computational efficiency, with the test accuracy differing from the theoretical optimum by only about 0.7%, and our mechanism can outperform the other greedy algorithms. Additionally, our data allocation strategy enhances the test accuracy by approximately 7% compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Across all periods of human history, the importance attributed to health has remained a fundamental and significant facet. This statement holds greater validity within the present context. The pressing demand for healthcare solutions with real-time capabilities, affordability, and high precision is crucial in medical research and technology progress. In recent times, there has been a significant advancement in emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, blockchain, and edge computing. These breakthrough developments have led to the creation of various intelligent applications. Smart healthcare applications can be realized by combining robust AI detection and prediction capabilities with edge computing architecture, which offers low computing costs and latency. In this paper, we begin by conducting a literature review of AI-assisted EC-based smart healthcare applications from the past three years. Our goal is to identify gaps and barriers in this field. We propose a smart healthcare architecture model that integrates AI technology into the edge. Finally, we summarize the challenges and research directions associated with the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "Rapid progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is presenting both opportunities and threats that promise to be transformative and disruptive to the field of cybersecurity. The current approaches to providing security and safety to users are limited. Online attacks (e.g., identity theft) and data breaches are causing real-world harms to individuals and communities, resulting in financial instability, loss of healthcare benefits, or even access to housing, among other undesirable outcomes. The resulting challenges are expected to be amplified, given the increased capabilities of AI and its deployment in professional, public, and private spheres. As such, there is a need for a new formulation of these challenges that considers the complex social, technical, and environmental dimensions and factors that shape both the opportunities and threats for AI in cybersecurity. Through an exploration and application of the socio-technical approach, which highlights the significance and value of participatory practices, we can generate new ways of conceptualising the challenges of AI in cybersecurity contexts. This paper will identify and elaborate on key issues, in the form of both gaps and opportunities, that need to be addressed by various stakeholders, while exploring substantive approaches to addressing the gaps and capitalizing on the opportunities at the micro/meso/macro levels, which in turn will inform decision-making processes. This paper offers approaches for responding to public interest security, safety, and privacy challenges arising from complex AI in cybersecurity issues in open socio-technical systems.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the adverse influence of communication time delay, the DC voltage of offshore converters is usually employed as input signals of existing communication-free frequency support schemes of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, the offshore DC voltage varies with the output power of OWFs, this distortion will deteriorate the frequency support performance. To address this issue, an improved communication-free coordinated control (ICFCC) scheme of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs for frequency support is proposed. The ICFCC scheme involves the onshore frequency variation into the DC voltage deviation once frequency events occur, and an estimator is proposed to obtain the onshore DC voltage in offshore VSC stations to provide fast frequency support and reduce the distortion influence. Meanwhile, to obtain better support performance, the frequency support power is allocated reasonably by regulating droop coefficients adaptively, more power will be injected via the station closer to the disturbing bus. After frequency support, the offshore wind turbines will recover their rotor speed with asymptotic control to reduce second frequency drop. Case studies are carried out on the 4-terminal and 5-terminal test systems, respectively, while considering the parameter uncertainties and noise disturbance. Different control methods are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the ICFCC scheme.",

    "abstract": "At present, the natural gas network, thermal network and power grid can be coupled in the integrated energy system(IES) to provide users with different forms of energy such as heat, electricity and gas, but the relevant coordinated control strategies have not been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, a hierarchical distributed coordinated control strategy is proposed. The system is organized into three levels, namely IES-level, Micro-energy Internet(MEI)-level and component-level based on multi-agent system approach. To achieve accurate control of voltage and frequency of distributed devices and accurate distribution of the tie-line power in case of load fluctuations in MEI, a second-level optimization controller based on distributed sparse communication network is designed. In addition, in order to analyze the impact of communication delay on the coordinated control of MEI-level agents, the communication topology is optimized according to the basic graph theory. Finally, taking IES with three MEIs as an example, the validity of the proposed control strategy is verified on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform.",

    "abstract": "With the liberalization of the retail market, customers can sell their demand response (DR) resources to the distribution company (Disco) through the DR aggregator (DRA). In this paper, an intelligent DR resource trading framework between Disco and DRA is proposed by exploiting the benefits of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The hierarchical decision process of the two players is modeled as a Stackelberg game. In the game, Disco is the leader who determines the retail price while DRA is the follower who responds to it. To protect the privacy, a dueling deep Q-network (dueling DQN) is then constructed to model the bi-level Stackelberg game, such that the lower-level problem doesn't need to reveal its detailed model to the upper-level. In learning process, the uncertainties from the DRA's baseline load and wind power are considered. Concretely, to boost the robustness against the estimation error, the baseline load is discretized into symbols before used as the input states of dueling DQN. And to mitigate the uncertainty of wind power, the scenario-based method is introduced when designing the reward. We demonstrate that the proposed dueling DQN-based method has good performance and is more robust against the uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of deep learning (DL), the task of multimodal dialog emotion recognition (MDER) has recently received extensive research attention, which is also an essential branch of DL. The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, and in different dialog scenes. However, the existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialog relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel dialog and event relation-aware graph convolutional neural network (DER-GCN) for multimodal emotion recognition method. It models dialog relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multirelationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialog. Moreover, we also introduce a self-supervised masked graph autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new multiple information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets, Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) and Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD), which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves both the average accuracy and the $F1$ value of emotion recognition. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuntaoshou/DER-GCN.",

    "abstract": "Minerals serve as the cornerstone of contemporary societal infrastructure and diverse industries. However, the mining sector perennially confronts transportation challenges marked by elevated expenses, diminished efficiency, and significant environmental ramifications. Although autonomous driving has been accomplished in open scenarios, its development in specialized areas remains limited. The open-pit mine, one of the typical unstructured environments, presents several challenges, encompassing complex geological conditions, and strict requirements for intelligent algorithms. These factors create formidable barriers to the implementation of autonomous driving technology in mining areas. The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides indispensable insights for addressing these challenges. This article introduces an assistant-driven approach via LLMs to realize Mining 5.0, representing an elevated level of intelligent mining operations. This exploration delves deeply into the necessity and feasibility of this approach from various perspectives, providing substantial theoretical support for the development of mining areas.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the stabilization problem is addressed for a class of globally Lipschitz nonlinear dynamical systems. An event-triggered impulsive control (ETIC) method is introduced to establish asymptotic stability and exponential stability criteria for the resulting closed-loop systems without and with time delay, respectively. Compared with the extant results, a new type of switching and event-triggered impulsive systems are considered, and some general asymptotic stability and exponential stability conditions are provided. It is proved that Zeno behaviors can be excluded and the control frequency can be appropriately regulated through the appropriate selection of event parameters. Finally, an application example of the Chuaâs circuit is given to verify the efficiency of the approach and theoretical analyses. Note to Practitioners âSince impulsive control provides an easier and cheaper strategy than continuous control, it has been widely applied to many practical situations, such as control of satellite rendezvous, synchronization of permanent magnet synchronous motors, consensus of multi-agent systems and so on. Different from the time-triggered impulsive control methods, the proposed ETIC method can flexibly regulate the control frequency, which meets the increasing requirement for reducing unnecessary waste of communication resources in modern industries. Compared with the extant results, an ETIC method is established with time-varying threshold parameters and event interval parameters in this paper. Moreover, the effects of event parameters and time delay on convergence rate are analyzed, which can provide reference for improving system performance in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the amalgamation of cell-free (CF) and extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technologies, referred to as a CF XL-MIMO, as a promising advancement for enabling future mobile networks. To address the computational complexity and communication power consumption associated with conventional centralized optimization, we focus on user-centric dynamic networks in which each user is served by an adaptive subset of access points (AP) rather than all of them. We begin our research by analyzing a joint resource allocation problem for energy-efficient CF XL-MIMO systems, encompassing cooperative clustering and power control design, where all clusters are adaptively adjustable. Then, we propose an innovative double-layer multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based scheme, which offers an effective strategy to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional signal processing. In the section of numerical results, we compare various algorithms with different network architectures. These comparisons reveal that the proposed MARL-based cooperative architecture can effectively strike a balance between system performance and communication overhead, thereby improving energy efficiency performance. It is important to note that increasing the number of user equipments participating in information sharing can effectively enhance SE performance, which also leads to an increase in power consumption, resulting in a non-trivial trade-off between the number of participants and EE performance.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the full-width half maximums(FWHM) of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fiber sensor and to improve the sensitivity and figure of merit(FOM). This paper proposes a novel biosensing concept by combining the Long-Range surface plasmon resonance (LRSPR) phenomenon and the tunneling effect induced by Frustrated total-internal reflection (FTIR). Multilayer sensing structures with energy transfer effects excited by LRSPR were designed. For the first time, a structure with two metal layers sandwiched between three dielectric matching layer(DML) film layers is proposed. The bilayer of the lithium fluoride (LiF)-Au-titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) film layer structure can enhance the surface electric field of the sensor, which makes the sensor structure have high sensitivity and FOM. The sensitivity of the sensor is 4869 nm/RIU under external conditions with a refractive index(RI) of 1.33223-1.37223 RIU, which is 1.2 times higher than the conventional surface plasmon resonance (CSPR) sensors, and the FOM can reach 41.26 RIU -1 , which is 1.72 times higher than the CSPR sensors. In addition, the TiO2 and LiF in this sensor are less prone to collapse, and the stability test results show that the relative standard deviation (RSD) is 0.4091%, which demonstrates good reliability and stability. The LRSPR sensor has the high sensitivity and FOM, and long detection distance, which makes it practical in the field of biochemical sensing.",

    "abstract": "The design of precoding plays a crucial role in achieving a high downlink sum rate in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this correspondence, we propose a deep learning based joint CSI feedback and multiuser precoding method in frequency division duplex systems, aiming at maximizing the downlink sum-rate performance in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the eigenvectors of the CSI matrix are compressed using deep joint source-channel coding techniques. This compression method enhances the resilience of the feedback CSI against degradation in the feedback channel. A joint multiuser precoding module and a power allocation module are designed to adjust the precoding direction and the precoding power for users based on the feedback CSI. Experimental results demonstrate that the downlink sum-rate can be significantly improved by using the proposed method, especially in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratio and low feedback overhead.",

    "abstract": "Accurate preoperative recurrence prediction for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a challenging issue in the medical field. Existing studies primarily conduct image and molecular analyses independently or directly fuse multimodal information through radiomics and genomics, which fail to fully exploit and effectively utilize the highly heterogeneous cross-modal information at different levels and model the complex relationships between modalities, resulting in poor fusion performance and becoming the bottleneck of precise recurrence prediction. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified framework, the Self-and-Mutual Attention (SAMA) Network, designed to efficiently fuse and utilize macroscopic CT images and microscopic gene data for precise NSCLC recurrence prediction, integrating handcrafted features, deep features, and gene features. Specifically, we design a Self-and-Mutual Attention Module that performs three-stage fusion: the self-enhancement stage enhances modality-specific features; the gene-guided and CT-guided cross-modality fusion stages perform bidirectional cross-guidance on the self-enhanced features, complementing and refining each modality, enhancing heterogeneous feature expression; and the optimized feature aggregation stage ensures the refined interactive features for precise prediction. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits broad applicability to various cancers.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in autonomous driving thanks to its robustness under harsh weather conditions. However, compared to LiDAR point clouds, mmWave radar point clouds tend to be sparse and include several âghostâ targets. Existing methods attempt to optimize radar signal processing to generate superior radar point cloud. Nonetheless, these methods are primarily designed for simple scenarios. How to obtain superior radar point clouds for complex autonomous driving scenarios is still unexplored. In this article, we propose a novel point cloud generation network that generates superior radar point clouds by utilizing complementary advantage of radar and camera. Technically, our approach comprises three key steps. First, to obtain precise relationships between neighboring pixels, the mmWave range-azimuth map (RAM) is enhanced to extract the radar affinity matrix. Second, to obtain dense image bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, image features are diffused by learning local details from the radar affinity matrix. Third, to obtain superior radar point clouds, radar features and diffused image features are combined in a unified BEV representation, and optimized by K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we collect a real-world dataset under autonomous driving scenarios to conduct experiments. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms exisiting ones in producing high-quality radar point clouds. And as a consequence, the radar point cloud generated using our methods significantly improve the performance of object detection task.",

    "abstract": "Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is considered a revolutionary technology that enables powerful signal processing directly in the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and has significant energy-saving advantages. In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two sub problems. For the transmit power allocation sub problem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization sub problem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave based beam forming design, where increasing the number of meta atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.",

    "abstract": "Depth completion aims to recover dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements. It is a fundamental challenge in computer vision that is faced in numerous applications, such as robotics, UAVs, and autonomous driving. With the recent advancement in hardware, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology is now commonly employed in high-level perception tasks of autonomous driving. However, compared to LiDAR point clouds, mmWave radar point clouds tend to be sparse and include several ghost targets. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-guided network architecture to perform depth diffusion by utilizing the consistent relationship between semantics and depth. Our method first utilizes semantic features from images to extend the height measurements, and then transforms the global depth completion task into a series of category-specific depth diffusion tasks to learn the semantic-depth priors and accommodate radar sparsity. In addition, a gradient-guided Smooth-Edge loss is developed to explicitly constrain the semantic regional consistency and border discontinuity. Meanwhile, a 4D dataset that features Camera, 4D Radar, and LiDAR measurement in diverse scenes is collected to conduct experiments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over existing monocular and fusion-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) secure communication system with integrated sensing and communications. We consider wireless security enhancement for a multiple-antenna UAV transmitting ISAC waveforms to communicate with multiple ground Internet-of-Thing devices and detect the surrounding environment. Specifically, we aim to maximize the average communication secrecy rate by optimizing the UAV trajectory and beamforming vectors. Given that the UAV trajectory optimization problem is non-convex due to multi-variable coupling develop an efficient algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can ensure the accuracy of sensing targets and improve the communication secrecy rate.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) has long been an active research topic as it enables us to infer human behaviors and daily routines from sensor data collected on wearables or on sensors embedded in a pervasive sensing environment. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in HAR for feature extraction and multimodal fusion, and has achieved promising performance on activity recognition. However, they often require a large number of labeled data for training. To directly tackle this challenge, this paper proposes SelfVis, a novel visualization-based self-supervised learning technique, which aims to extract effective features without the need of labeled data. To achieve this goal, it encodes time-series IMU sensor readings into images and then employs ResNet, a pretrained, state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone feature extractor. It leverages the fact that there exist multiple sensors often being used and uses sensor identifications that are generated automatically as a prediction target during the self-supervised learning process. With these two, SelfVis has achieved high activity recognition accuracy even when only a small number of labeled data are available; that is, with only 1% training data, SelfVis has demonstrated the ability to achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art techniques by up to 0.46 in macro F1-scores.",

    "abstract": "Vector four-wave mixing (FWM) plays a crucial role in optical parametric amplification, optical wavelength conversion, supercontinuum generation, and optical frequency combs. Here, we investigate the polarization dependence in vector FWM excited by ultrafast lasers with wavelength-resolved polarization structures, by performing single-shot, wavelength-resolved polarization measurements. A dissipative soliton with wavelength-resolved polarization structure and a continuous wave laser as pump lights, are used to excite vector FWM and cascaded FWM in nonlinear fiber. Based on a home-made high-speed polarization analyzer, we verify experimentally that the polarization of Stokes light generated by vector FWM is wavelength-dependent. Besides, when the first-order Stokes light with the polarization structure participates in the second-order cascaded FWM, we observe significant polarization destabilization for the second-order Stokes light. The experimental data proves that the polarization-sensitive characteristics of vector FWM can be manifested as differences in Stokes light generation efficiency and polarization distribution stability. Our works provide more information about the nonlinear optical conversion process based on ultrafast lasers, deepen the understanding of the coherence degradation in supercontinuum generation, chaos formation, and demonstrate the possibility of generation ultrafast lasers with even more complex polarization structures, optimization of optical parametric amplification, et al.",

    "abstract": "The structured light (SL)-based three-dimensional (3D) measurement techniques with deep learning have been widely studied to improve measurement efficiency, among which fringe projection profilometry (FPP) and speckle projection profilometry (SPP) are two popular methods. However, they generally use a single projection pattern for reconstruction, resulting in fringe order ambiguity or poor reconstruction accuracy. To alleviate these problems, we propose a parallel dual-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer network (PDCNet), to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for processing different SL modalities. Within PDCNet, a Transformer branch is used to capture global perception in the fringe images, while a CNN branch is designed to collect local details in the speckle images. To fully integrate complementary features, we design a double-stream attention aggregation module (DAAM) that consists of a parallel attention subnetwork for aggregating multi-scale spatial structure information. This module can dynamically retain local and global representations to the maximum extent. Moreover, an adaptive mixture density head with bimodal Gaussian distribution is proposed for learning a representation that is precise near discontinuities. Compared to the standard disparity regression strategy, this adaptive mixture head can effectively improve performance at object boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce fringe order ambiguity while producing high-accuracy results on self-made datasets.",

    "abstract": "The key technologies of sixth generation (6G), such as ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), enable intricate interactions between antennas and wireless propagation environments. As a result, it becomes necessary to develop joint models that encompass both antennas and wireless propagation channels. To achieve this, we utilize the multi-port communication theory, which considers impedance matching among the source, transmission medium, and load to facilitate efficient power transfer. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of insertion loss, mutual coupling, and other factors on the performance of multi-port matching networks. Next, to further improve system performance, we explore two important deep unfolding designs for the multi-port matching networks: beamforming and power control, respectively. For the hybrid beamforming, we develop a deep unfolding framework, i.e., projected gradient descent (PGD)-Net based on unfolding projected gradient descent. For the power control, we design a deep unfolding network, graph neural network (GNN) aided alternating optimization (AO)-Net, which considers the interaction between different ports in optimizing power allocation. Numerical results verify the necessity of considering insertion loss in the dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) performance analysis. Besides, the proposed PGD-Net based hybrid beamforming approaches approximate the conventional model-based algorithm with very low complexity. Moreover, our proposed power control scheme has a fast run time compared to the traditional weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method.",

    "abstract": "Object detection for autonomous haulage trucks in open-pit mines is challenging due to unstructured environments. Collecting and annotating large-scale real-world images in these harsh conditions is extremely expensive. Inspired by parallel vision, virtual images have been used to supplement real-world data. However, models trained on virtual data exhibit poor performance in real mines due to the simulation-to-real (sim2real) domain shift. To address this issue, a human-in-the-loop algorithm called Active Parallel Teacher (APT) is introduced to select and annotate real images for sim2real object detection, in which the gradient information of a mean-teacher architecture is formulated as an important indicator for sample selection. Based on the gradient embeddings, three active sampling metrics are designed to measure sample importance from different perspectives including uncertainty, inter-domain difference, and diversity of target domain. Following that, an adaptive budget allocation strategy is presented to achieve the trade-off between uncertainty and difference along with different model training stages, with the purpose of maximizing the performance gain of human annotations. Finally, a Mean Teacher based domain adaptation process is developed to leverage fine-tuning and mix-training techniques to full utilize both labeled and unlabeled real data. Experimental results on the open-pit mine dataset demonstrate that our method can outperform other domain adaptation methods and attains 91% of the performance achieved under fully supervised conditions with only 7.5% of the real data labeled.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of 6G communication and the wide deployment of high-speed rail (HSR), it becomes essential to enhance the utilization of HSR communication resources while ensuring the requirements of communication-sensitive users for high reliability and low latency. Meanwhile, the development of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), brings more inspiration for smart HSR. In this background, we model an ISAC and hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC) system for UAV-assisted HSR. We formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) with the objective of maximizing the fair sum rate while satisfying the minimum radar sensing requirement. To solve this problem of non-convex and high coupling, we propose a hybrid particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) that combines the fast convergence of PSO and the strong global search ability of GA, with parameter-free penalty functions. Through careful design, PSO-GA dynamically balances the exploration and development capabilities. It achieves the best overall performance with a faster convergence speed than existing algorithms. An average improvement of 29%, 57% and 42% has been achieved with different numbers of passengers, total transmission power and number of RBs. This paper supports the future development of intelligent HSR communication.",

    "abstract": "Due to the flourishing of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) technology has made significant progress and has become an indispensable research area. Many radar systems use multiple feature maps and handle them directly in image format. However, the generation of multiple forms of feature maps requires heavy computational resources, which makes it impractical for real-world applications. Additionally, many networks fail to fully extract temporal information from the time-Doppler (TD) map during the feature extraction. Therefore, a time-weighted network based on strip pooling (TWN-SP) using the TD map is proposed in this paper. The TWN-SP consists of two time-weighted modules based on Fire (TWMs-F) and a feature fusion module based on temporal and channel attention (FFM-TCA). Due to the application of depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and placing the feature fusion step at the forefront, the proposed network has fewer parameters. Moreover, a radar dataset named RadSet is constructed, containing TD maps of six daily activities. To validate the performance of the TWN-SP, a ten-fold cross-validation (CV) on the public dataset named Radar848 and a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) CV on the RadSet dataset are carried out, respectively. To further validate the generalization performance of TWN-SP, a comparative analysis was conducted on another public dataset, Ci4R. The TWN-SP achieves an accuracy of 99.28% on the RadSet dataset. Experimental results indicate that the TWN-SP surpasses the current leading networks in both performance and complexity.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) multiagent reinforcement algorithms distinguish themselves in many ways from their single-agent equivalences. However, most of them still totally inherit the single-agent explorationâexploitation strategy. Naively inheriting this strategy from single-agent algorithms causes potential collaboration failures, in which the agents blindly follow mainstream behaviors and reject taking minority responsibility. We name this problem the responsibility diffusion (RD) as it shares similarities with the same-name social psychology effect. In this work, we start by theoretically analyzing the cause of this RD problem, which can be traced back to the explorationâexploitation dilemma of multiagent systems (especially large-scale multiagent systems). We address this RD problem by proposing a policy resonance (PR) approach which modifies the collaborative exploration strategy of agents by refactoring the joint agent policy while keeping individual policies approximately invariant. Next, we show that SOTA algorithms can equip this approach to promote the collaborative performance of agents in complex cooperative tasks. Experiments are performed in multiple test benchmark tasks to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) greatly improves coverage and reliability for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. However, a significant challenge arises in the transmission scheduling due to the rapid changes in channel state, link selection for train mobile relays (MRs), and order of the flow scheduling. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an optimization problem focused on maximizing the weighted sum completed flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements for HSR mmWave communication in SAGIN. To facilitate the simultaneous scheduling of flows by base station-MR (BS-MR), satellite-airship-MR, and satellite-MR links, we propose a link selection algorithm, which can help each flow choose a suitable set of links in every frame and determine whether the BS networks need the assistance of the satellite and airship. Furthermore, taking into account the priority and occupied time slots (TSs) resource of different flows, we propose a multi-link weighted flow scheduling (MWFS) algorithm. This algorithm not only prioritizes scheduling high-priority flows but also aims to maximize the weighted sum completed flows for MRs. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm significantly increases the weighted sum completed flows and the total transmitted bits. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal flow transmission in different link switching periods and enhance the scheduling of high-priority flows compared to other algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Wireless train communication network (WLTCN) is an emerging technology for enabling intelligent rail vehicles. It is responsible for providing train control services (TCS), passenger information services (PIS), and train sensing services (TSS). These services within WLTCN have notably different quality of service (QoS) requirements from traditional telecommunication services. In this paper, to incorporate multiple services in a single WLTCN, we propose a radio access network (RAN) slicing architecture empowered WLTCN to satisfy the demands of services and save bandwidth resource. In particular, the service and slicing models of TCS, PIS, and TSS are investigated. By analyzing the heterogeneous characteristics and QoS requirements of the above services within WLTCN, we exploit the orthogonal multiple access scheme for TCS and PIS and the non-orthogonal multiple access scheme for TSS, respectively. The system bandwidth minimization problem is formulated with slicing resource allocation for TCS, PIS, and TSS and non-orthogonal access grouping for TSS terminals as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To solve the intractable MINLP, the original problem is transformed and decoupled into the two subproblems. Then, we propose a joint bandwidth optimization and terminal clustering (JBOTC) algorithm to tackle the bandwidth allocation problem with optimal terminal grouping strategy for TSS effectively. The closed-form expressions of the optimal bandwidth allocation strategy for three services are derived. The simulation results illustrate the performance superiority for saving bandwidth of the JBOTC algorithm to the benchmark schemes. Our proposed slicing strategy enables WLTCN to support heterogeneous services co-existence with minimal bandwidth consumption.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) offers significant advantages in mobility scenarios, mainly due to the elimination of cell boundaries and strong macro diversity. In this paper, we examine the downlink performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference. However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability. These factors complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems. Consequently, we propose a novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these challenges. The established framework incorporates a graph neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability, and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish contributions. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. In particular, appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.",

    "abstract": "Mangroves are in coastal zones where mass-energy exchange is most active. Their functions in high productivity, strong carbon sequestration capacity, and rich ecosystem services are crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although various classification methods have been extensively applied in large-scale mangrove observations, they necessitate considerable sample collection and post-processing, which hampers the long-term identification of mangroves. This study proposes a hybrid identification method that combines the time-frequency threshold of the mangrove index with a random forest binary classifier. It efficiently identifies mangroves over large-scale areas with low post-processing and high accuracy. The hybrid method was applied to Landsat 8 OLI data to derive the mangrove distribution in China using Google Earth Engine. It demonstrated an overall accuracy rate of 92.86% and an F1 score of 0.92, a significant improvement over using either method alone. Specifically, the method utilized a small sample size to successfully obtain pure and accurate mangrove classification. The feature selection indicates that the short-wave infrared band and its associated remote sensing indices play a pivotal role in differentiating mangroves from other confusable land classes. Additionally, this method was successfully applied to Landsat 5 data, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.49%, with substantial agreement between the classification results of the two sensors. This indicates that the method has the potential for continuous monitoring of mangroves over large areas and extended periods.",

    "abstract": "Due to the engineering requirements of no or few phase separations of high-standard plateau and mountain electrified railways, an interconnected traction power supply system for traction substations group (TSG-ITPSS) has been proposed. In contrast to conventional TPSSs, TSG-ITPSSs lack powerful external power grids. In addition, the number of traction substations (TSs), the number and type of trains are numerous, and negative sequence compensation equipment (NSCE) is utilized. These problems drastically aggravate the harmonic distortion, so it is necessary to investigate the harmonic behavior and the harmonic suppression scheme of TSG-ITPSSs. A dynamic harmonic model is established, and the influences of the aforementioned issues are analyzed. A new phenomenon that running trains produce subresonance has been found and explained. This subresonance results in a sudden increase in the main resonance and characteristic harmonic resonances. Based on the analytical harmonic modeling, a harmonic impendance model of the NSCE considering frequency and load current coupling is established, and its harmonic influence is analyzed. Finally, to overcome the poor high-frequency suppression effect, the existing scheme is improved based on a PI and repetitive controller (RC). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by comparison with passive power filters (PPFs) and the existing scheme.",

    "abstract": "We proposed and demonstrated a high precision distributed temperature sensing system by utilizing the intricate spectral characteristics of phase-shifted fiber Bragg gratings (PSFBG). By employing optical frequency domain reflectometry, we have achieved exceptional localization accuracy with 20.5 Î¼m and spectral reconstruction with the wavelength accuracy of 0.1 pm. In the experiment, we characterized the temperature sensing property of a strong standard PSFBG and an array of 1,974 ultra-weak PSFBGs, respectively. The temperature sensitivity of the single PSFBG is approximately 10.4 pm/Â°C with an average temperature precision of 0.05 Â°C and a minimum precision of 0.01Â°C, which is significantly improved over the traditional FBG sensors. In the case of the sensor array, the average temperature precision is 0.13 Â°C and the minimum precision reaches 0.06Â°C, with a sensing spatial resolution of 20 mm. These results indicate that the proposed system is highly suitable for precision measurement tasks, offering both precise positioning and temperature sensing.",

    "abstract": "High altitude platforms (HAPs) are considered promising candidates for providing high-capacity wireless communications. In high-speed railway (HSR) communications, the fast velocity requires frequent handovers and beam switching, incurring expensive costs. In contrast, HAPs are being considered due to their extensive coverage and line-of-sight (LoS) paths. These platforms aim to offer communication capabilities that leverage the advantages of both terrestrial and satellite systems. Due to their extensive coverage, there is no need for frequent beam switching, thereby reducing the requirement for additional overhead costs. However, there can be unexpected floating of HAPs, lead to beam misalignment and deterioration in antenna gain, especially in narrow beams. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive time slot allocation algorithm with neighbour-grid beam search scheme which optimizes the 3D beam direction to matgyhximize the total transmitted data. Simulations show that our scheme achieves near-optimal performance but with lower complexity.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile data demand, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication has become one of the candidate technologies to improve data rates for highspeed railway (HSR). However, the cost of covering HSR lines through terrestrial base stations (BSs) alone is unaffordable, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we consider a scheme of the airship-assisted mmWave communication for HSR in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Furthermore, we introduce an optimal scheduling problem of maximizing the number of flows that satisfy the quality of service (QoS) requirements between the airship and the train's mobile relays (MRs). To solve the above problem, we propose a MR selection algorithm to determine the number of MRs within the airship's coverage at every frame. Then we propose a max-flow scheduling algorithm based on the MR selection algorithm, which can increase the number of successfully scheduled flows by optimizing the scheduling order of the flows. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can effectively improve the number of successfully scheduled flows and bits. We also verify that the proposed algorithm can further improve the system performance with increasing the number of MRs.",

    "abstract": "3D multi-object tracking is one of the important research directions in computer vision and holds significant research value in the field of autonomous driving. Relying solely on single image information or point cloud information is insufficient to overcome tracking challenges in complex scenarios. Currently, multimodal fusion 3D tracking methods still face numerous issues in fusion performance, data association, and trajectory management. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic 3D multi-object tracking method based on spatiotemporal features. First, a multi-scale spatial feature embedding fusion network is designed to enhance the weight of critical information within different modal features, thereby improving the prominence of target features. Second, a temporal aggregation embedding module is proposed to address the characteristics of point cloud features and fusion features, enhancing feature alignment when target features are integrated into temporal features, resulting in more robust temporal features. Finally, a multi-stage hybrid affinity dynamic association module and an adaptive dynamic trajectory management module are combined to reduce the impact of similar targets on tracking, which improves the model's ability to perceive target positions in dense scenes, and enhances the robustness of target association matching. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves better tracking performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been successful in solving many cooperative challenges. However, classic non-hierarchical MARL algorithms still cannot address various complex multi-agent problems that require hierarchical cooperative behaviors. The cooperative knowledge and policies learned in non-hierarchical algorithms are implicit and not interpretable, thereby restricting the integration of existing knowledge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical MARL model called Hierarchical Cooperation Graph Learning (HCGL) for solving general multi-agent problems. HCGL has three components: a dynamic Extensible Cooperation Graph (ECG) for achieving self-clustering cooperation; a group of graph operators for adjusting the topology of ECG; and an MARL optimizer for training these graph operators. HCGL's key distinction from other MARL models is that the behaviors of agents are guided by the topology of ECG instead of policy neural networks. ECG is a three-layer graph consisting of an agent node layer, a cluster node layer, and a target node layer. To manipulate the ECG topology in response to changing environmental conditions, four graph operators are trained to adjust the edge connections of ECG dynamically. The hierarchical feature of ECG provides a unique approach to merge primitive actions (actions executed by the agents) and cooperative actions (actions executed by the clusters) into a unified action space, allowing us to integrate fundamental cooperative knowledge into an extensible interface. In our experiments, the HCGL model has shown outstanding performance in multi-agent benchmarks with sparse rewards. We also verify that HCGL can easily be transferred to large-scale scenarios with high zero-shot transfer success rates.",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication, an intelligent communication paradigm that aims to transmit useful information in the semantic domain, is facilitated by deep learning techniques. Robust semantic features can be learned and transmitted in an analog fashion, but it poses new challenges to hardware, protocol, and encryption. In this paper, we propose a digital semantic communication system, which consists of an encoding network deployed on a resource-limited device and a decoding network deployed at the edge. To acquire better semantic representation for digital transmission, a novel non-linear quantization module is proposed to efficiently quantize semantic features with trainable quantization levels. Additionally, structured pruning is incorporated to reduce the dimension of the transmitted features. We also introduce a semantic learning loss (SLL) function to reduce semantic error. To adapt to various channel conditions and inputs under constraints of communication and computing resources, a policy network is designed to adaptively choose the split point and the dimension of the transmitted semantic features. Experiments using the CIFAR-10 and Mini-ImageNet dataset for image classification are employed to evaluate the proposed digital semantic communication network, and ablation studies are conducted to assess the proposed quantization module, structured pruning, and SLL.",

    "abstract": "As the CMOS technology continues to shrink, latches are becoming increasingly susceptible to multiple-node-upset caused by charge sharing in radiation environments. In this paper, a low-cost quadruple-node-upset self-recoverable latch based on cross-interlocking (Quad-CIRC) is proposed. By utilizing four Cross-Interlocking self-Recoverable Cells (CIRCs) for interlocking, complete quadruple-node-upset self-recovery is achieved with reduced sensitive nodes. Meanwhile, the majority of currently available quadruple-node-upset self-recoverable latches are primarily composed of C-elements based redundancy, resulting in a significant increase in area overhead. However, Quad-CIRC effectively reduces area overhead while ensuring hardened capability through cross-interlocking of CIRCs. HSPICE based simulations in 22nm CMOS technology demonstrate that Quad-CIRC achieves a reduction of 69.08% on average of power consumption, an increase of 16.83% on average of delay, a reduction of 63.51% on average of PDP, a reduction of 51.01% on average of area, a reduction of 83.44% on average of APDP, and an increase of 60.49% on average of critical charge, compared to five other quadruple-node-upset self-recoverable latches (QRHIL, MURLAV, LDAVPM, QR-R11-C2, and LDQNUSR).",

    "abstract": "This paper applies graph neural networks (GNN) in UAV communications to optimize the placement and transmission design. We consider a multiple-user multiple-input-single-output UAV communication system where a UAV intends to find a placement to hover and serve users with maximum energy efficiency (EE). To facilitate the GNN-based learning, we adopt the hybrid maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing scheme to design the beamforming vectors and a feature augment is implemented by manually setting edge features. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage GNN-based model where the first stage and the second stage yield the placement and the transmission design, respectively. The two stages are connected via a residual and their learnable weights are jointly optimized via unsupervised learning. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness and validate the scalability to both UAV antennas and users of the proposed model.",

    "abstract": "In the fields of health care and clinical monitoring, vision-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has achieved significantly progress, but it still faces the challenge of poor generalization ability under unconstrained conditions of occlusions and pose variation. Recently, Vision-Language Model (VLM) has greatly advanced the FER task. However, the existing VLM-based FER methods typically leverage a hard-crafted prompt (e.g.â, a photo of classâ) and only focus on the holistic semantic alignment, which may suffer from modal heterogeneity. In this work, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model via Prompt Masking for FER (PMFER). Specifically, for each expression, we first create fine-grained prompts using facial action units to guide the image encoder to learn discriminative representations. Further, to finely align text prompts and visual action units, we randomly drop a phrase description in the prompts and then predict the dropped phrase by conducting modal cross attention, implicitly promoting fine-grained vision-language alignment. In addition, we also design a modal-adversarial strategy to holistically eliminate the modal difference between visual and textual embeddings in a common latent space. Experimental results demonstrate that our PMFER model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several FER benchmarks, especially under the conditions of occlusions and pose variations. Note to Practitioners âFacial expression recognition is very important in health care and clinical monitoring, which provides an useful tool to assess the psychological and physiological conditions of patients. Although FER has made significant progress with the development of deep learning technologies, it still faces problems in the complex environments (e.g., occlusions and pose variations). To address the above issues, we propose a novel FER method in this work based on the recent vision-language model. It takes RGB image and text prompts as input and finally predicts t...",

    "abstract": "In the field of biosensing, a major innovation has been realized in this work: a wavelength-interrogating surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor incorporating a high-precision and high-resolution prism turntable system has been designed and constructed. The sensor not only retains the classical advantages of SPR sensors, such as high sensitivity, non-labeling, real-time monitoring, and fast response, but also realizes a quantum leap in sensitivity at the critical incidence angle by introducing a unique prism coupling technique. The breakthrough of this research lies in the first experimental verification of the sensorâs sensitivity as high as 10367 nm/RIU at an incidence angle of 52.8Â°, which is nearly five times higher than that of the conventional fiber-optic SPR sensors, marking a major breakthrough in the performance of SPR sensors. In addition, this study also deeply explores the effect of the change of incidence angle on the sensor sensitivity, which provides a brand new thinking perspective for the traditional strategy of material to improve the sensitivity. Through both theoretical and experimental verification, this research not only opens up a new way for the development of SPR sensor technology, but also predicts that this innovative system will have a widely application prospect in the field of biochemical detection.",

    "abstract": "The lack of privacy-preserving capabilities hinders the further development of blockchains and smart contracts. While numerous privacy solutions have been proposed, limitations persist. Firstly, most existing solutions focus on specific privacy protections such as anonymous payments, private data, or multi-party computation tasks. However, these solutions lack a general privacy ability, allowing users to deploy applications with diverse privacy requirements. Secondly, existing solutions have limited customizability, which means users cannot easily customize and adapt the privacy policies according to their specific demands or preferences. In this paper, we present EtherCloak, which adopts trusted execution environments (TEEs) to achieve a general and customizable privacy policy on account model blockchains, enabling users to conceal any on-chain information. To address the security issues caused by the unreliability of the host the TEE runs on, we design the enclave state check and crash recovery mechanisms and employ them in the block generation process. In addition, we propose an access control mechanism for privacy policy management and data query. We prove that EtherCloak offers general and customizable privacy protection with a minimal increase in transaction size (less than triple) and communication overhead (approximately 10%) compared to Ethereum.",

    "abstract": "This paper firstly proposes a hydrogen energy hub to satisfy the diverse hydrogen demands of industrial users consuming renewable energy for low-carbon emissions. In the hydrogen energy hub, two techniques, i.e., water electrolysis and biomass gasification, are coupled through complementary oxygen utilization. Then, an industrial integrated energy distribution system is formally constructed by incorporating multiple hydrogen energy hubs, battery energy storage, renewable energy sources, and a gas generator to coordinate local renewable resources. Accordingly, a real-time energy management system for a hydrogen energy hub-based industrial integrated energy distribution system is further proposed to efficiently coordinate multiple resources in the distribution network. To minimize the real-time operational cost of an industrial integrated energy distribution system under stochastic environments of time-variant renewable generation, biomass moisture content, electricity prices, and electrical loads, multidimensional piecewise linear function-based approximate dynamic programming is adapted. Finally, case studies validate the techno-economic benefits of the proposed system and the advantages of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a three-level step-up cell (TLSC) with bipolar outputs is proposed, composed of two different step-up cells (SCs) cascaded through the shared two-winding coupled inductor. The bipolar output voltages are impervious to the influence of parasitic parameters and have the ability to self-balance. By combining the TLSC with the classical Sepic converter, a novel single-switch TL step-up dc/dc converter is proposed for ac module applications, with the capability to achieve high voltage gain and bipolar outputs. As a result, the proposed converter inherits the advantages of good self-balancing performance from the TLSC, so that its bipolar output voltages can effectively resist the effect of parasitical parameters, especially switch and coupled inductor. Besides, its coupled inductor is composed of only two windings, replacing the three windings coupled inductor used in other similar converters. This eliminates the requirement for complex winding processes to mitigate the difference in parasitic parameters among different windings. The theoretical analysis and the principal operation of the proposed converter are discussed in detail. Finally, this converter is established to verify its performance.",

    "abstract": "Low-temperature power-to-hydrogen (LTPtH) is a multi-energy system where electrical, thermal, mechanical and chemical energies are interacting and interconverting. However, the current PtH electrolyzers usually operates under constant temperature, flow rate and power, which tends to deviate from efficient operating states with fluctuating renewable energy supply (e.g. wind and PV). Therefore, this paper proposes maximum efficiency point tracking for LTPtH plant with renewable energy integration, by considering the interaction of the multiphysics fields in the electrolyzer. The multi-physical parameters are coordinated through the optimal power distribution among the pump, the heat exchanger and the electrolyzer, so that the energy conversion from electricity to hydrogen with the maximum efficiency can be acquired with various power supply. To formulate the optimization problem, the multiphysics model of the electrolyzer is established, including the diphasic flow, the temperature field and the electrochemical reaction. From the simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by illustrating the trade-offs among the multiphysics fields in the electrolyzer. Besides, the model has been applied to the scenario where hydrogen is produced by fluctuating renewable energy. From the simulation results, an overall efficiency gain of 22.17% can be obtained through MEPT of the PtH plant with fluctuating power supply.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes an S-shaped fiber Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) sensor structure capable of simultaneously measuring refractive index (RI) and temperature for the first time. The innovative sensor design integrates multi-mode fiber, single-mode fiber, and coreless fiber. A section of the S-shaped sensing region is created by heating a single-mode fiber with a heating rod, upon which a 50 nm Au film is deposited to induce the SPR phenomenon for RI measurement. Another section of the S-shaped sensing region is formed by heating a coreless fiber, also with a heating rod, and coating it with a 50 nm Au film and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for temperature measurement. The complete S-shaped fiber sensor facilitates simultaneous RI and temperature measurements. It exhibits a high sensitivity of 2864.52 nm/RIU within the RI confines of 1.3339 to 1.3746 RIU and a high sensitivity of -1.6107 nm/Â°C within the temperature confines of 30 to 65Â°C. This S-shaped fiber sensor demonstrates remarkable repeatability and stability, with the maximum measurement error being 0.00028 RIU for RI and 0.31Â°C for temperature. Characterized by its simplicity, low cost, and compact size, this sensor is well-suited for broad applications in biochemical analysis and temperature monitoring within complex environments.",

    "abstract": "CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is the mostly used model to formulate the received tensor signal in a massive MIMO system, as the receiver generally sums the components from different paths or users. To achieve accurate and low-latency channel estimation, good and fast CP decomposition (CPD) algorithms are desired. The CP alternating least squares (CPALS) is the workhorse algorithm for calculating the CPD. However, its performance depends on the initializations, and good starting values can lead to more efficient solutions. Existing initialization strategies are decoupled from the CPALS and are not necessarily favorable for solving the CPD. This paper proposes a deep-learning-aided CPALS (DL-CPALS) method that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to generate favorable initializations. The proposed DL-CPALS integrates the DNN and CPALS to a model-based deep learning paradigm, where it trains the DNN to generate an initialization that facilitates fast and accurate CPD. Moreover, benefiting from the CP low-rankness, the proposed method is trained using noisy data and does not require paired clean data. The proposed DL-CPALS is applied to millimeter wave MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements of the proposed method in terms of both speed and accuracy for CPD and channel estimation.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Accurate localization of the instrument tip within the hepatic vein is crucial for the success of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedures. Real-time tracking of the instrument tip in X-ray images is greatly influenced by vessel deformation due to patient's pose variation, respiratory motion, and puncture manipulation, frequently resulting in failed punctures. Method: We propose a novel framework called deformable instrument tip tracking (DITT) to obtain the real-time tip positioning within the 3D deformable vasculature. First, we introduce a pose alignment module to improve the rigid matching between the preoperative vessel centerline and the intraoperative instrument centerline, in which the accurate matching of 3D/2D centerline features is implemented with an adaptive point sampling strategy. Second, a respiration compensation module using monoplane X-ray image sequences is constructed and provides the motion prior to predict intraoperative liver movement. Third, a deformation correction module is proposed to rectify the vessel deformation during procedures, in which a manifold regularization and the maximum likelihood-based acceleration are introduced to obtain the accurate and fast deformation learning. Results: Experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets show an average tracking error of 1.59 $\\pm$ 0.57 mm and 1.67 $\\pm$ 0.54 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Our framework can track the tip in 3D vessel and dynamically overlap the branch roadmapping onto X-ray images to provide real-time guidance. Significance: Accurate and fast (43 ms per frame) tip tracking with the proposed framework possesses a good potential for improving the outcomes of TIPS treatment and minimizes the usage of contrast agent.",

    "abstract": "Both the space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) and the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are promising technologies in future communication systems. This paper investigates the mobile user (MU) tracking and robust beamforming design by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an SAGIN-ISAC system. Two schemes for acquiring the location information of MUs at the UAV are proposed, namely the space-assisted and ISAC-assisted schemes. The former requires the precise location information from the satellite by the space-air transmission, while the latter estimates the location information of MUs via a proposed extended Kalman filter based algorithm. The obtained location information is then utilized to predict the channel distribution of MUs, which can be used to formulate an outage-constrained energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. The considered problem is first reformulated based on the Bernstein-type inequality to derive computationally tractable forms of the outage probability constraints. Then, the reformulated problem is solved via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation methods, where the tightness of employing SDR is theoretically proved. Numerical results illustrate the trajectories of the UAV for tracking MUs under the space-assisted and ISAC-assisted schemes, and discuss the impact of the space-air transmission on the EE performance. It is observed that there exists a trade-off between space-air transmission overhead and location prediction precision of MUs. By integrating the ISAC in SAGIN, the information demand from the space is reduced compared with traditional SAGIN.",

    "abstract": "In this article, an efficient wireless federated learning (FL) framework based on blockchain (BC) assistance is studied. Many existing frameworks adopt lots of third-party servers as consensus nodes, which is vulnerable to collusion attacks. In our framework, the blockchain-assisted FL (BFL) model selects edge users as blockchain nodes without any third-party intervention. Besides, the convergence analysis of this FL algorithm considering transmission outages is provided to prove the effects of wireless factors on FL. To solve the low efficiency of the BC based on the conventional linear chain structure, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain is introduced into our work. Moreover, since the design and optimization of FL and BC in most existing works are done separately, this may result in sub-optimal performance. To achieve an excellent trade-off between FL efficiency and BC performance, a joint optimization problem regarding DAG-BFL is formulated. The optimization objective is to maximize the FL performance and DAG-BC throughput. To solve the complex nonconvex optimization problem, considering the resource-constrained BFL system, the joint communication and computing resource allocation as well as block designing schemes are proposed, which are based on the twin-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and the successive block minimization technique (BSUM). Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, compared with the traditional alternative optimization, the proposed PDD-based algorithm achieves better performance.",

    "abstract": "Since digital spiking signals can carry rich information and propagate with low computational consumption, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received great attention from neuroscientists and are regarded as the future development object of neural networks. However, generating the appropriate spiking signals remains challenging, which is related to the dynamics property of neurons. Most existing studies imitate the biological neurons based on the correlation of synaptic input and output, but these models have only one time constant, thus ignoring the structural differentiation and versatility in biological neurons. In this article, we propose the reconstruction of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (R-ALIF) neuron to perform complex behaviors similar to real neurons. First, a synaptic cleft time constant is introduced into the membrane voltage charging equation to distinguish the leakage degree between the neuron membrane and the synaptic cleft, which can expand the representation space of spiking neurons to facilitate SNNs to obtain better information expression way. Second, R-ALIF constructs a voltage threshold adjustment equation to balance the firing rate of output signals. Third, three time constants are transformed into learnable parameters, enabling the adaptive adjustment of dynamics equation and enhancing the information expression ability of SNNs. Fourth, the computational graph of R-ALIF is optimized to improve the performance of SNNs. Moreover, we adopt a temporal dropout (TemDrop) method to solve the overfitting problem in SNNs and propose a data augmentation method for neuromorphic datasets. Finally, we evaluate our method on CIFAR10-DVS, ASL-DVS, and CIFAR-100, and achieve top1 accuracy of\n81.0%\n,\n99.8%\n, and\n67.83%\n, respectively, with few time steps. We believe that our method will further promote the development of SNNs trained by spatiotemporal backpropagation (STBP).",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been regarded as the basic model to facilitate deep learning (DL) for revolutionizing resource allocation in wireless networks. GNN-based models are shown to be able to learn the structural information about graphs representing the wireless networks to adapt to the time-varying channel state information and dynamics of network topology. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview for applying GNNs to optimize wireless networks via answering three fundamental questions, that is, how to input the system parameters of wireless networks into GNNs, how to improve the expressive performance of GNNs, and how to evaluate GNNs. Particularly, two graph representations are given to transform wireless network parameters into graph-structured data. Then, we focus on the architecture design of the GNN-based models by introducing the basic message passing, as well as model improvement methods, including a multi-head attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we give task-oriented evaluation metrics for DL-enabled wireless resource allocation schemes. We also highlight certain challenges and potential research directions for the application of GNNs in wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) technology advances, human activity recognition (HAR) using IoT devices including wearable sensors has become prevalent in various applications. Nevertheless, many sensor-based HAR methods still struggle to balance recognition accuracy with network complexity. Meanwhile, most existing sensor-based HAR networks fail to achieve an effective fusion of multidimensional features. To address the above issues, a hierarchical multiscale time-frequency and channel feature adaptive fusion (HMTF-CFAF) network is put forward. The HMTF-CFAF efficiently extracts unique multiscale time-frequency and channel features in sensor data using hierarchical connectivity. Furthermore, it incorporates a feature fusion mechanism to integrate and exchange multiscale and multidimensional features, providing more comprehensive and richer features. To evaluate the HMTF-CFAF network, we utilize three datasets: the University of California Irvine HAR (UCI-HAR), physical activity monitoring for aging people (PAMAP2), and self-collected household behavior (HB) dataset. The HMTF-CFAF network achieves the accuracy of 97.66%, 98.75%, and 98.80% on the above three datasets, respectively, demonstrating its excellent performance.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data, complementary with real-world datasets, have shown their effectiveness for autonomous driving in urban scenarios. However, for specific and complex environments, such as surface mines, which often involve extreme weather and corner cases, synthetic datasets are notably scarce. In this article, PMScenes, the first synthetic dataset for autonomous driving in surface mines, is built upon the previously public AutoMine dataset. It extends the available data by constructing corner case scenarios, such as unusual intrusions; collisions; and extreme weather scenarios including rain, blizzards, fog, and dust stormsâsituations that would bring significant safety risks and are hard to capture in the real world. Our article explores the enhancement methods for synthetic to real for perception tasks of autonomous driving under different challenging scenarios.

    "abstract": "Accurate wireless channel models are essential in design and optimization of wireless communication systems. Deep learning provides a promising approach for wireless channel modeling with the help of environmental information. One important application is satellite image-based path loss prediction, which has attracted much attention recently. For path loss prediction, environmental characteristics play a crucial role, with the most intuitive manifestation on images being coverage and resolution, referred to as environmental granularity . By adopting absolute measurement metric m/pixel , this paper investigates the impact of environmental granularities on deep learning-based path loss prediction through extensive experiments. Results indicate that with increasing environmental granularity, network prediction error exhibits a non- monotonic change. When environment granularity is low, increasing image resolution helps reduce error. However, when environment granularity is high, further increasing resolution actually leads to reduced prediction accuracy. These insights offer guidance for designing deep learning based networks for wireless channel prediction.",

    "abstract": "Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been considered essential to future air-space-ground integrated networks. Wireless channels significantly impact the performance of communication systems, especially in terms of large-scale fading characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM) for LEO satellite-ground large-scale channels. Propagation probabilities of line-of-sight (LoS) links, ground specular links, and building specular links for suburban, urban, dense urban, and high-rise urban in different elevations are computed. The Fresnel zone is utilized to determine whether the signals can arrive at the receiver. The impact of the radio coverage and receiver height on propagation probabilities are considered for each scenario. Based on the derived propagation probabilities, the average path loss is computed. In the simulation section, the results of our model are validated by the Monte Carlo method, and the average path loss is compared with the standard model in 3GPP TR 38.811. The comparison results have good consistency with the standard model. Moreover, our model can be applied in multiple scenarios by adjusting the environment parameters compared with the standard model.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) utilizes multiple distributed access points (APs) to achieve high spectral efficiency (SE). However, challenging propagation environments can degrade communication performance due to substantial penetration loss. Integrating a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into CF mMIMO can mitigate these issues by adjusting the phase and amplitude of the incident signals and adjusting the coefficients of its elements, providing a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint precoding design of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems to maximize the sum SE. This involves refining the precoding matrix at the APs and the reflection coefficients at the RIS. We introduce a fully distributed heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm that incorporates trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Unlike conventional multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on centralized training and execution, our HATRPO algorithm uses only local channel state information, reducing the need for high backhaul capacity by 13%. Simulation results demonstrate that our HATRPO algorithm significantly improves the sum SE in various scenarios",

    "abstract": "High-speed train (HST) has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry due to the rapid development of railways worldwide. Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, known for its large bandwidth is an effective way to address performance bottlenecks in cellular network based HST wireless communication systems. However, mmWave signals suffer from significant path loss when traversing carriage, posing substantial challenges to cellular networks. To address this issue, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have gained considerable interest for its ability to enhance cell coverage by reflecting signals toward receiver. Ensuring communication reliability, a core performance indicators of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) in fifth-generation systems, is crucial for providing steady and reliable data transmissions along railways, particularly for delivering safety and control messages and monitoring HST signaling information. In this paper, we investigate a refracting RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output URLLC system in mmWave HST communications. We propose a sum rate maximization problem, subject to base station beamforming constraint, as well as refracting RIS discrete phase shifts and reliability constraints. To solve this optimization problem, we design a joint optimization algorithm based on alternating optimization method. This involves decoupling the original optimization problem into active beamforming design and packet error probability optimization subproblem, and discrete phase shift design subproblems. These subproblems are addressed exploiting Lagrangian dual method and the local search method, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and highlight the benefits of refracting RIS adoption for sum rate improvement in mmWave HST networks.",

    "abstract": "Combining the internet of vehicles with autonomous driving visual perception can enhance vehicle intelligence. Vehicles use the 3D object detection algorithm to perceive their surroundings and share detection results with other vehicles using the internet of vehicles technology, improving the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Multimodal information fusion of LiDAR and cameras can improve the performance of 3D object detection. However, the different modality information is inhomogeneous, multimodal 3D object detection still has challenges such as difficult semantic alignment of modal elements and inadequate fusion. To mitigate these challenges, we first propose the sparse interaction with centroid query (SICQ) for voxel-level features from different modalities, which aligns different modal semantic information through more precise and fine-grained interaction. Then, we propose the dense fusion with multi-scale masked attention (DFMMA), using multi-scale feature masks from bird's-eye-view (BEV)-level multimodal features to improve performance for small object feature perception. Finally, we propose the multimodal grid encoder with positional information (MGEPI), through positional information implicitly guiding and the transformer-based attention mechanism for grid-level features, improves the perception of detection scene context spatial information and enhances the robustness of the algorithm. Additionally, this paper performs comprehensive experiments on the popular KITTI dataset and demonstrates that our algorithm has superior 3D object detection performance.",

    "abstract": "Wireless channels typically exhibit a sparse structure, with sparsity regarded as an inherent characteristics. A deeper understanding and accurate representation of channel sparsity contribute to a more comprehensive revelation of channel features and structure, thereby enhancing the performance of communication systems. However, current research on channel sparsity remains limited to the measurement, and traditional channel models have not sufficiently incorporated this critical characteristic. In this paper, considering channel deep sparse characteristics, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based channel sparsity-tunable framework is proposed to reconstruct channel samples with various levels of sparsity. Specifically, continuous sparsity factors and a sparsity measurement module are introduced to manipulate and predict the sparsity of the reconstructed channel in the framework design. Channel power and delay are employed for model training to better consider the channel behavior of sparsity. Furthermore, the mutual information between input sparsity factors and reconstructed channels is enhanced to ensure that the sparsity factor has an actual impact on the level of reconstructed channel sparsity, thereby enabling the flexible and continuous reconstruction of channels with varying levels of sparsity. Simulation results prove that the proposed framework can effectively and accurately reconstruct channels with different levels of sparsity by changing sparsity factor, as well as providing good performance in measuring the sparsity of wireless channel. Finally, sparse manipulation performance is further validated using channel capacity simulation.",

    "abstract": "In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold within Riemannian space has been frequently utilized to extract spatial features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the intrinsic high dimensionality of SPD matrices introduces too much computational burden to hinder the real-time applications of such BCI, especially in handling dynamic tasks, like incremental learning. Directly reducing the dimensionality of SPD matrices with conventional dimensionality reduction (DR) methods will alter the fundamental properties of SPD matrices. Moreover, current DR methods for incremental learning always necessitate retaining old data to update their representations under new mapping. To this end, a bidirectional two-dimensional principal component analysis for SPD manifold (B2DPCA-SPD) is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of SPD matrices, in such way that the reduced matrices remain on SPD manifold. Afterwards, the B2DPCA-SPD is extended to adapt to incremental learning tasks without saving old data. The incremental B2DPCA-SPD can be seamlessly integrated with the matrix-formed growing neural gas network (MF-GNG) to achieve an incremental EEG classification, where the new low-dimensional representations of the prototypes in old classifiers can be easily recalculated with the updated projection matrix. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets to perform the EEG classification. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computation time by 38.53% and 35.96%, and outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy by 4.21% to 19.59%.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is gaining attention as a prominent technology for enabling the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the vast antenna array and the huge bandwidth introduce a non-negligible beam squint effect, causing beams of different frequencies to focus at different locations. One approach to cope with this is to employ true-time-delay lines (TTDs)-based beamforming to control the range and trajectory of near-field beam squint, known as the near-field controllable beam squint (CBS) effect. In this paper, we investigate the user localization in near-field wideband XL-MIMO systems under the beam squint effect and spatial non-stationary properties. Firstly, we derive the expressions for CramÃ©r-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for characterizing the performance of estimating both angle and distance. This analysis aims to assess the potential of leveraging CBS for precise user localization. Secondly, a user localization scheme combining CBS and beam training is proposed. Specifically, we organize multiple subcarriers into groups, directing beams from different groups to distinct angles or distances through the CBS to obtain the estimates of usersâ angles and distances. Furthermore, we design a user localization scheme based on a convolutional neural network model, namely ConvNeXt. This scheme utilizes the inputs and outputs of the CBS-based scheme to generate high-precision estimates of angle and distance. The numerical results derived from CRBs reveal that the inherent spatial non-stationary characteristics notably increase the CRB for angle, but have an insignificant impact on the CRB for distance estimation. In addition, the CRBs for both angle and distance decrease with increasing bandwidth and number of subcarriers. More importantly, our proposed ConvNeXt-based user localization scheme achieves centimeter-level accuracy in localization estimates.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the diversity of biological neurons, quadratic artificial neurons can play an important role in deep learning models. The type of quadratic neurons of our interest replaces the inner-product operation in the conventional neuron with a quadratic function. Despite promising results so far achieved by networks of quadratic neurons, there are important issues not well addressed. Theoretically, the superior expressivity of a quadratic network over either a conventional network or a conventional network via quadratic activation is not fully elucidated, which makes the use of quadratic networks not well grounded. In practice, although a quadratic network can be trained via generic backpropagation, it can be subject to a higher risk of collapse than the conventional counterpart. To address these issues, we first apply the spline theory and a measure from algebraic geometry to give two theorems that demonstrate better model expressivity of a quadratic network than the conventional counterpart with or without quadratic activation. Then, we propose an effective training strategy referred to as referenced linear initialization (ReLinear) to stabilize the training process of a quadratic network, thereby unleashing the full potential in its associated machine learning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on popular datasets are performed to support our findings and confirm the performance of quadratic deep learning. We have shared our code in https://github.com/FengleiFan/ReLinear.",

    "abstract": "Object detection through LiDAR-based point cloud has recently been important in autonomous driving. Although achieving high accuracy on public benchmarks, the state-of-the-art detectors may still go wrong and cause a heavy loss due to the widespread corruptions in the real world like rain, snow, sensor noise, etc . Nevertheless, there is a lack of a large-scale dataset covering diverse scenes and realistic corruption types with different severities to develop practical and robust point cloud detectors, which is challenging due to the heavy collection costs. To alleviate the challenge and start the first step for robust point cloud detection, we propose the physical-aware simulation methods to generate degraded point clouds under different real-world common corruptions. Then, for the first attempt, we construct a benchmark based on the physical-aware common corruptions for point cloud detectors, which contains a total of 1,122,150 examples covering 7,481 scenes, 25 common corruption types, and 6 severities. With such a novel benchmark, we conduct extensive empirical studies on 12 state-of-the-art detectors that contain 6 different detection frameworks. Thus we get several insight observations revealing the vulnerabilities of the detectors and indicating the enhancement directions. Moreover, we further study the effectiveness of existing robustness enhancement methods based on data augmentation, data denoising, test-time adaptation. The benchmark can potentially be a new platform for evaluating point cloud detectors, opening a door for developing novel robustness enhancement methods.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric cryptography is the de-facto approach to information security for ad-hoc underwater acoustic networks. The requirement is that all network nodes possess the same cryptographic keys and key distribution that happens offline. Thus, it is hardly possible to include a new keyless node during network operation. In addition, online key replenishment is an open problem. In this article, we tackle key distribution/replenishment by formulating a new protocol that generates a key between two trusted underwater acoustic nodes (Alice and Bob) without the need to exchange the key itself. The proposed protocol initially extracts common acoustic channel features between Alice and Bob after some signal exchanges. Then, each party uses these features to generate his/her own secret bits via a random sequence generator. To correct any differences in their secret bits, we propose two reconciliation methods that employ ReedâSolomon codes. At the last step of the protocol, a 256-bit cryptographic key is generated by feeding the reconciled secret bit string to the Secure Hash Algorithm 3. We evaluate the key generation rate of the proposed protocol with real acoustic data recorded from a littoral environment, in which Alice and Bob exchanged 915 channel probes over different link geometries. To assess security performance, we invent a passive eavesdropper, Eve, who is able to simulate the acoustic link between Alice and Bob. She uses her simulated channels and the same protocol to generate her keys. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between the key generation rate of Alice and Bob and Eve's ability to extract the same key. Our best result shows that Alice and Bob can independently generate 567 keys out of 915 attempts while Eve does not have access to any of the keys.",

    "abstract": "The swift progress of metasurface technology, enabling meticulous manipulation of the propagation environment, is anticipated to bring a transformative impact on sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications efficiency. Utilizing metasurface elements presents a promising opportunity for achieving passive scattering at sub-wavelength scales, facilitating intelligent radio settingsâ advancement. Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (ARIS) have gained significant interest in emergent metasurface technology. In contrast to passive RIS, which exhibits a certain degree of performance enhancement but encounters restrictions arising from the âdouble fading\" phenomenon in the phase response, ARIS emerges as a highly promising alternative to counter such restrictions. This study provides a complete examination of ARIS, particularly emphasizing current improvements and its various uses within the context of 6G wireless networks. The review commences by laying a robust foundation in RIS technology, covering the various types and modes of RIS. Following this, we will explore the benefits and practical implementations of ARIS. Through a systematic examination, we categorize different approaches within ARIS-enabled use cases. These scenarios include optimizing the sum rate and signal-to-noise ratio, attaining maximum secrecy rate, energy minimization, and ensuring channel estimation. Additionally, we provide a summary and lessons learned along with a summary table for each category to describe, contrast, and evaluate the existing literature regarding setup, channel characteristics, methodologies, and objectives. We highlight the crucial role of ARIS in defining the landscape of wireless communications in the 6G era by outlining the open research problems in this emerging area and exploring the attractive future prospects.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. However, FL entails exposing the model to various participants. This poses a risk of unauthorized model distribution or resale by the malicious client, compromising the intellectual property rights of the FL group. To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embed the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints. Experimental results show FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, and maintains good fidelity and robustness against various watermark removal attacks.",

    "abstract": "In 5G and Beyond-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor networks, the end-to-end (E2E) route traverses via multiple heterogeneous network domains, necessitating inter-domain interaction to guarantee and confirm quality-of-service (QoS) for low power IoT devices applications. Moreover, in heterogeneous IoT sensor networks, the E2E path often encompasses domains with diverse QoS parameters or classes. The unique E2E requirements for delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), and other factors present further challenges. However, existing legacy network architectures and typical software-defined networking (SDN) models lack effective strategies for QoS provisioning tailored to the service requests of IoT low power sensor devices. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel multi-objective SDN-based framework for IoT sensors, ensuring E2E QoS across multiple domains with heterogeneous traffic service classes (TSC). A two-layer software-defined networking (SDN) framework is presented to provision QoS for IoT sensors based on their specific service demands at the E2E network level. Central to the framework is the deployment of an optimal additive weighting module (OAWM), facilitating TSC ranking according to their weights and incorporating a priority mechanism for specific service parameters such as delay, PLR, and jitter. Additionally, the global controller statistics enable the provisioning of E2E QoS by mapping the service requests from IoT sensors. Experimental evaluations are conducted to compare the proposed approach with existing schemes. The results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating improved E2E QoS provisioning and meeting the specific requirements of IoT sensors in precision agriculture with low-power IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted widespread attention due to its high-quality rendering, and ultra-fast training and rendering speed. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that the proposed method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods. Our code will be made publicly available, and more information can be found on our project page (https://zju3dv.github.io/pgsr/).",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time security constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED) problems have been the subject of significant research interest in recent years. However, ordinary RL approaches struggle to ensure satisfaction of system- and device-wise constraints, having to penalize constraint violations individually. With increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, large-scale energy storage integration is witnessed, driven by their ability to mitigate RES intermittency. This gives rise to the need of time-coupling constraint satisfaction in the RT-SCED problems. Existing safe RL methods either rectify unsafe actions at each time step with a safety layer, which may lead to sub-optimal actions devised at the boundary of feasible space, and may violate time-coupling constraints; or construct a safety evaluation model, which may violate single-step constraints. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel safe deep RL method, featuring safety exploration and safety optimization modules, facilitating comprehensive satisfaction of single-step and time-coupling constraints. Furthermore, the policy network features a residual network architecture and allows direct computation of real-value dispatch of all controllable resources, adapting to their distinct power output ranges. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in cost efficiency, operational security, computational and scalability performance, compared to state-of-the-art model-driven and data-driven baseline methods, on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems.",

    "abstract": "Physical human-robot interactions (pHRIs) can improve robot autonomy and reduce physical demands on humans. In this paper, we consider a collaborative task with a considerably long object and no prior knowledge of the objectâs parameters. An integrated control framework with an online object parameter estimator and a Cartesian object-aware impedance controller is proposed to realize complicated scenarios. During the transportation task, the object parameters are estimated online while a robot and human keep lifting an object. The perturbation motion is incorporated into the null space of the desired trajectory to enhance the estimator precision. An object-aware impedance controller is designed by incorporating the real-time estimation results to effectively transmit the intended human motion to the robot through the object. Experimental demonstrations of collaborative tasks, including object transportation and assembly, are implemented to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed controller was also compared to a conventional impedance controller through subjective testing and found to be more sensitive, requiring less human effort. Note to Practitioners âThis research was motivated by the need to facilitate collaboration between humans and robots in handling heavy or considerable long objects, which can be challenging for a single operator. This paper proposes a physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) approach that enables physical interaction between the human and the robot through the object without additional sensors such as camera or human-machine interfaces. To achieve collaborative task, the separation between the intended human motion and the object dynamics is essential. Most of real-world situations involve uncertain or unknown objects, making it challenging to assume prior knowledge of the target objectâs properties. Therefore, this research introduces a real-time approach for estimating the dynamic parameters of unknown objects during ...",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on solving the finite-time distributed optimization issue of fractional-order multiagent systems (FOMASs) over unbalanced directed graphs (digraphs) that are subject to disturbances. Each agent in the FOMASs has a local cost function that is only available to itself, which may or may not be convex and quadratic. To address this challenge, the study proposes a fully distributed gradient-sum-estimation (GSE) optimization algorithm as a continuous control law, which comprises three parts. In the first part, a disturbance estimator term is proposed for each agent to estimate its disturbance within a finite time. In the second part, a sliding-mode control (SMC) term is presented to ensure that all agents reach the sliding surface within a finite time. In the last part, a novel GSE-based optimization term is constructed to capture the global optimal solution within a finite time. The GSE is fully distributed and used for estimating the sum of all gradients within a finite time. This fully distributed GSE optimization algorithm has zero-error finite-time convergence, disturbance rejection, and chatter avoidance properties. Finally, the study verifies the validity and superiority of the proposed GSE optimization algorithm by comparing some graphical simulation results. Note to Practitioners âDue to the presence of disturbances in actual industrial systems, the distributed optimization problem of disturbed FOMASs is studied in this study, which can be applied to energy consumption optimization, parameter estimation and scheduling, economic dispatch, and distributed energy resources optimal in power systems. Our study proposes a novel completely distributed fractional-order controller that is endowed with the properties of disturbance rejection, zero-error finite-time optimal convergence, and chatter avoidance. The commonly existing limitation that each local cost function is convex or quadratic hinders its implementation in real-world scenarios. We addres...",

    "abstract": "Future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to include new features such as the network data analysis function (NWDAF), which will allow network operators to integrate machine learning (ML)-based data analysis techniques into their networks. This will allow NWDAF to identify, safeguard against, and handle various types of anomalous behaviors on user devices. To this end, this study applies fair federated learning (FL) to the 3GPP standard NWDAF architecture and embeds the designed multi-task ML model to detect traffic anomalies in different types of user devices. However, there is a problem of different task demands when the same ML model is used for optimization between different tasks. Therefore, a global alternating gradient projection (AGP) technique is presented in this study. It can be applied to many tasks and utilized to solve minimization problems. The two gradient projection phases comprise each iteration of the AGP. These steps update various tasks at regular intervals, thereby providing a regularized version of the gradient to the original multi-task objective function, which results in optimal task performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-task ML model can simultaneously detect traffic anomalies of different types of user devices in NWDAF and outperforms state-of-the-art models in detecting multi-task anomalies in NWDAF. The experimental evaluation also implied that the designed FL applies superior anomaly detection performance in NWDAF scenarios and has lower communication overhead than that of the traditional NWDAF without affecting the ML performance.",

Two new notions, algorithm DB variability and $(\\epsilon, \\eta)$ - data DB variability , are proposed to measure the DB variability from the algorithm and data perspectives. Extensive experiments show significant negative correlations between the DB variability and the generalizability. From the theoretical view, two lower bounds based on algorithm DB variability are proposed and do not explicitly depend on the sample size. We also prove an upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}\\left(({1}/{\\sqrt{m}})+\\epsilon+\\eta\\log({1}/{\\eta})\right)$ based on data DB variability. The bound is convenient to estimate without the requirement of labels and does not explicitly depend on the network size which is usually prohibitively large in deep learning.",

    "abstract": "In surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization, privacy-preservation and trusted data sharing has become an increasingly important concern, especially in scenarios involving distributed sensitive data. Existing privacy-preserving surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization algorithms heavily rely on the basic federated learning framework. However, recent findings have revealed possible vulnerabilities within this framework, including susceptibility to adversarial threats like gradient leakage and inference attacks. To address the above challenges and enhance privacy protection, this paper proposes to protect the raw data by applying a differentially private stochastic gradient descent method to train surrogate models. A differential evolution operator is designed to generate personalized new samples for multiple clients based on promising and additional auxiliary samples, avoiding the exposure of online newly generated data. Moreover, a similarity-based aggregation algorithm is integrated to effectively construct the global surrogate model. A rigorous security analysis is provided to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in privacy protection. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits remarkable optimization performance on a set of synthetic problems with federated settings while maintaining the data privacy.",

    "abstract": "In the control problems of multi-agent systems, collision avoidance is a fundamental safety requirement. One effective approach to ensure safety involves combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with quadratic programming (QP), where nominal control inputs are incorporated into QPs to achieve desired control objectives. Additionally, it is crucial to study the control performance of multi-agent systems to balance these objectives with control efforts. This work demonstrates that the performance index is closely related to the hyperparameters in the CBF-based QP controller, and the Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to optimize and improve performance. Firstly, a safe control approach is developed and a unified performance enhancement framework is established to optimize the performance index. Hyperparameters are then explored and categorized, introducing the concept of feasible hyperparameters to describe the attainability of control objectives. Subsequently, the constrained Bayesian optimization algorithm is employed to identify a set of feasible and optimal hyperparameters in a data-driven manner, even when the functional expressions of performance and constraints are unknown. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods in multi-agent systems. Note to Practitioners âBoth safety and optimality are of great importance in the control systems. The design and development of controllers for multi-agent systems are currently undergoing significant evolution. Academic researchers and industrial practitioners are actively refining controller designs to perform better in a variety of collaborative tasks. With practical applications in mind, there is a growing demand for control techniques capable of ensuring a safe operating environment while maintaining efficiency in energy consumption. Therefore, this paper aims to furnish practitioners and researchers with a safe control framework, facilitating the refinement of opt...",

    "abstract": "Recently, the accuracy of image-text matching has been greatly improved by multimodal pretrained models, all of which use millions or billions of paired images and texts for supervised model learning. Different from them, human brains can well match images with texts using their stored multimodal knowledge. Inspired by that, this paper studies a new scenario as unpaired image-text matching, in which paired images and texts are assumed to be unavailable during model learning. To deal with it, we accordingly propose a simple yet effective method namely Multimodal Aligned Conceptual Knowledge (MACK). First, we collect a set of words and their related image regions from publicly available datasets, and compute prototypical region representations to obtain pretrained general knowledge. To make the obtained knowledge better suit for certain datasets, we refine it using unpaired images and texts in a self-supervised learning manner to obtain fine-tuned domain knowledge. Then, to match given images with texts based on the knowledge, we represent parsed words in the texts by prototypical region representations, and compute region-word similarity scores. At last, the scores are aggregated based on bidirectional similarity pooling into an image-text similarity score, which can be directly used for unpaired image-text matching. The proposed MACK is complementary with existing models, which can be easily extended as a re-ranking method to substantially improve their performance of zero-shot and cross-dataset image-text matching.",

    "abstract": "Masked autoencoder (MAE) has been regarded as a capable self-supervised learner for various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the model still lacks high-level discriminability, which results in poor linear probing performance. In view of the fact that strong augmentation plays an essential role in contrastive learning, can we capitalize on strong augmentation in MAE? The difficulty originates from the pixel uncertainty caused by strong augmentation that may affect the reconstruction, and thus, directly introducing strong augmentation into MAE often hurts the performance. In this article, we delve into the potential of strong augmented views to enhance MAE while maintaining MAEâs advantages. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective masked Siamese autoencoder (MSA) model, which consists of a student branch and a teacher branch. The student branch derives MAEâs advanced architecture, and the teacher branch treats the unmasked strong view as an exemplary teacher to impose high-level discrimination onto the student branch. We demonstrate that our MSA can improve the modelâs spatial perception capability and, therefore, globally favors interimage discrimination. Empirical evidence shows that the model pretrained by MSA provides superior performances across different downstream tasks. Notably, linear probing performance on frozen features extracted from MSA leads to 6.1% gains over MAE on ImageNet-1k. Fine-tuning (FT) the network on VQAv2 task finally achieves 67.4% accuracy, outperforming 1.6% of the supervised method DeiT and 1.2% of MAE.

    "abstract": "Ensemble object detectors have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in enhancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by significant computational and storage demands, limiting their feasibility in resource-constrained settings. To overcome this, researchers have focused on distilling the knowledge from ensemble object detectors into a single model. In this paper, we introduce ProbED, an innovative ensemble distillation framework that consolidates knowledge from multiple object detectors into a single, resource-efficient model. Unlike traditional ensemble distillation methods that average the outputs of sub-teachers, ProbED captures comprehensive outcome distributions from all sub-teachers, providing a more nuanced approach to knowledge transfer. ProbED employs knowledge probabilization to achieve a sophisticated and refined aggregation of teacher knowledge, including feature knowledge, semantic knowledge, and localization ...",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading methodology for image generation and have proven successful in the realm of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. However, existing reconstruction methods based on diffusion models are primarily formulated in the image domain, making the reconstruction quality susceptible to inaccuracies in coil sensitivity maps (CSMs). k -space interpolation methods can effectively address this issue but conventional diffusion models are not readily applicable in k -space interpolation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach called SPIRiT-Diffusion, which is a diffusion model for k -space interpolation inspired by the iterative self-consistent SPIRiT method. Specifically, we utilize the iterative solver of the self-consistent term (i.e., k -space physical prior) in SPIRiT to formulate a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the diffusion process. Subsequently, k -space data can be interpolated by executing the diffusion process. This innovative approach highlights the optimization modelâs role in designing the SDE in diffusion models, enabling the diffusion process to align closely with the physics inherent in the optimization model-a concept referred to as model-driven diffusion. We evaluated the proposed SPIRiT-Diffusion method using a 3D joint intracranial and carotid vessel wall imaging dataset. The results convincingly demonstrate its superiority over image-domain reconstruction methods, achieving high reconstruction quality even at a substantial acceleration rate of 10. Our code are available at https://github.com/zhyjSIAT/SPIRiT-Diffusion.",

A triple-coupled transformer-based gm-booting technique in the CG stage enhances gain and noise figure (NF) performances. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS, the proposed LNA achieves a measured power gain of 23.8 dB at 123 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 10 GHz. The lowest NF is 5.0 dB at 123 GHz and the NF is below 6.5 dB from 114 to 128 GHz. The LNA consumes 26 mW from a 1-V supply, with a core chip area of 0.25 mm Ã 0.70 mm.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the critical need for effective mental stress monitoring, linked to severe health issues like depression and heart disease. We introduce a robust method using in-ear photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for detecting and classifying stress levels. The objective of this study is to develop a precise stress monitoring technique using advanced signal processing and deep learning. Raw PPG data were collected from 15 subjects undergoing stress-inducing activities in a controlled setting. The data underwent preprocessing and were transformed into image-like time-frequency representations. We employed Vision Transformer (ViT) models for classification, which were fine-tuned and compared against other state-of-the-art deep learning models. The ViT classifier significantly outperformed existing models, achieving an average accuracy of 97.78% and an F1-score of 97.79%. While the dataset is relatively small, these results suggest a promising direction for stress monitoring by illustrating the potential of combining in-ear PPG signals with ViT models. The study indicates the efficacy of this novel approach for accurate mental stress diagnosis, which could have significant implications for mental health applications. Future work will focus on validating these findings with a larger sample size and exploring the integration of this technology into wearable devices for real-world stress monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence technologies have given rise to traditional robotics. Intelligent tutoring robots, supported by artificial intelligence technologies and hardware design, have sparked a new revolution in all walks of traditional education. Despite the growing number of research papers published on intelligent tutoring robots, and a few limited reviews focusing on specific technologies or theoretical aspects, there is still no wide-ranging review work that systematically summarizes the studies from the perspectives of theoretical level and practical implications concluded in experiments. To address this challenge and promote a common understanding of the concept of intelligent tutoring robot, we conducted a systematic literature review of papers published between 2016 and 2023. We investigated the construction of intelligent tutoring robots, the advanced artificial intelligence technologies employed, and intelligent tutoring robots' applications in educational contexts. From a total of 1751 publications, we selected and analyzed 105 main studies to identify and address three research questions: 1) How does the construction of intelligent tutoring robots affect education? 2) What artificial intelligence technologies enable intelligent tutoring robots to be âintelligentâ? 3) How are intelligent tutoring robots applied in educational contexts? Additionally, we discuss the challenges of current research and provide an outlook on future development trends to provide guidelines for participators and researchers in the fields of intelligent tutoring robots.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) that collect information from neighbors are commonly utilized in semi-supervised learning contexts. In particular, a significant body of research has been dedicated to developing effective graph filters and aggregation methods to filter the information from adjacent nodes. Despite their efficacy, these approaches may encounter challenges due to the sparsity of training nodes, especially when their features are represented as sparse vectors (e.g., bag-of-words). This condition can lead to the overfitting of certain dimensions within the first projection matrix (hyperplane), as the training samples may not adequately represent the full spectrum of learnable parameters. To solve this limitation, we propose an innovative perturbation technique. Specifically, we introduce additional training variability by modifying both the initial features and the hyperplane, which contributes to the reduction of prediction variance by updating the entire dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to address the overfitting issue in GNNs precipitated by sparse node features. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets and ablation studies affirm that our proposed method significantly enhances node classification performance, with improvements of up to 46.5% in GNN algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the general domain of video reconstruction (VR) is fragmented into different shutters spanning global shutter and rolling shutter cameras. Despite rapid progress in the state-of-the-art, existing methods overwhelmingly follow shutter-specific paradigms and cannot conceptually generalize to other shutter types, hindering the uniformity of VR models. In this paper, we propose UniVR, a versatile framework to handle various shutters through unified modeling and shared parameters. Specifically, UniVR encodes diverse shutter types into a unified space via a tractable shutter adapter, which is parameter-free and thus can be seamlessly delivered to current well-established VR architectures for cross-shutter transfer. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conceptualize UniVR as three shutter-generic VR methods, namely Uni-SoftSplat, Uni-SuperSloMo, and Uni-RIFE. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the pre-trained model without any fine-tuning can achieve reasonable performance even on novel shutters. After fine-tuning, new state-of-the-art performances are established that go beyond shutter-specific methods and enjoy strong generalization.

    "abstract": "Generating agents that can achieve zero-shot coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to underscore the significance of the heterogeneous ZSC tasks and to introduce an effective framework for addressing it.",

    "abstract": "The inherent sparsity of LiDAR data often leads to extremely sparse depth maps, which poses a challenge for the development of LiDAR-based egocentric vehicles, such as self-driving cars and mobile robots. To overcome this limitation, guided depth completion methods use calibrated camera images to create precise, dense depth predictions from sparse LiDAR data. However, the extreme reliance on camera image limits its generalization of guided depth completion, especially its robustness to weather and light. In this paper, we aim to utilize camera images only during training phase to improve unguided depth completion, and discard camera in the inference phase. We comprehensively analyze the pivotal role of camera images in the depth completion task and emphasize the significance of the frequency distribution within the local windows, quantitatively demonstrating its substantial contribution. Subsequently, we introduce cross-modality knowledge distillation to align LiDAR features with camera features in the frequency domain, yielding corresponding guidance features. We devise a guidance and selection module to mitigate unavoidable inaccuracies in knowledge distillation, while it can enhance depth features and adeptly selects more precise encoded values from both the guidance branch and the unguided input. To further refine the completion result, we propose a progressive depth completion module incorporating two sub-networks connected by an attention for refinement module. This module produces weighted features from the decoder of the first stage to enhance the features in the encoder of the second stage. We denominate our method as Better Unguided Network (BUNet) and evaluate its efficacy on the KITTI depth completion benchmark and NYUv2 dataset, demonstrating its superiority over methods that exclude camera images during the inference phase.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method in the field of robotic vision, specifically designed to operate effectively under various lighting conditions. We propose an Image Enhancement Method for parcel loading status recognition, which addresses the challenge of insufficient lighting inside freight trucks without requiring lighting adjustments. Our approach integrates GAN and YOLO v5 into an end-to-end structure, where the detection networkâs outputs influence the training of the generative network. Unlike traditional methods that focus solely on enhancing low-light image visibility, our method is optimized to maximize detection accuracy. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we constructed a setup resembling a freight truck, collected a dataset under varying lighting conditions, and conducted extensive experiments. The latter sections of the paper review relevant studies on vision data control in computer vision, provide a detailed explanation of our method, describe the experimental setup and database acquisition process, and discuss the results and analyses. The conclusion is presented in Section 6.",

    "abstract": "Referring segmentation is a fundamental vision-language task that aims to segment out an object from an image or video in accordance with a natural language description. One of the key challenges behind this task is leveraging the referring expression for highlighting relevant positions in the image or video frames. A paradigm for tackling this problem in both the image and the video domains is to leverage a powerful vision-language (âcross-modalâ) decoder to fuse features independently extracted from a vision encoder and a language encoder. Recent methods have made remarkable advances in this paradigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the Transformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks. Adopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better cross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic and visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder network. Based on the idea of conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature encoding stage, we propose a unified framework named Language-Aware Vision Transformer (LAVT), which leverages the well-proven correlation modeling power of a Transformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context. This way, accurate segmentation results can be harvested with a light-weight mask predictor. One of the key components in the proposed system is a dense attention mechanism for collecting pixel-specific linguistic cues. When dealing with video inputs, we present the video LAVT framework and design a 3D version of this component by introducing multi-scale convolutional operators arranged in a parallel fashion, which can exploit spatio-temporal dependencies at different granularity levels. We further introduce unified LAVT as a unified framework that could handle both image and video inputs with enhanced segmentation capability on unified referring segmentation task. Our methods surpass previous s...",

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprinting is a leading method for indoor positioning due to its widespread infrastructure. Traditional fingerprinting classifies location by signal distance from a reference point (RP), assuming similarity between path and radio signal distances. Recently, model-based deep learning has been used to classify location estimates by identifying patterns in the radio environment. However, this method often loses consistency between space and signals as it learns without considering the correlation between RPs, necessitating retraining on unmeasured points. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Deep Similarity Model that can incorporate new RPs without the need for retraining. This model maintains consistency between distance and RSS by preserving the feature distribution using a center estimator to effectively learn RSS features through an embedding network. Subsequently, a Deep Similarity Network (DSN) employing Scaled Dot Product Similarity (SDPS), a novel distance-based deep architecture, estimates location by comparing RSS features with the RP. We designed the model end-to-end and optimized it using cross-entropy loss. The proposed model approximates the location coordinates as the center of mass based on the estimated probabilities of RPs. Our results demonstrate that the model not only achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art techniques but also maintains its scalability and performance consistency with the addition and deletion of RPs.",

    "abstract": "Self-knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful method, notably boosting the prediction accuracy of deep neural networks while being resource-efficient, setting it apart from traditional teacher-student knowledge distillation approaches. However, in safety-critical applications, high accuracy alone is not adequate; conveying uncertainty effectively holds equal importance. Regrettably, existing self-knowledge distillation methods have not met the need to improve both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification simultaneously. In response to this gap, we present an uncertainty-aware self-knowledge distillation method named UASKD. UASKD introduces an uncertainty-aware contrastive loss and a prediction synthesis technique within the self-knowledge distillation process, aiming to fully harness the potential of self-knowledge distillation for improving both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Extensive assessments illustrate that UASKD consistently surpasses other self-knowledge distillation techniques and numerous uncertainty calibration methods in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification metrics across various classification and object detection tasks, highlighting its efficacy and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the formation control of uncertain multi-agent systems with a safety requirement of collision avoidance. The control inputs are determined through quadratic programming (QP) solvers, where both the control Lyapunov function condition and control barrier function condition serve as constraints in the QP problem to achieve the control and safety objectives, respectively. In this work, the Bayesian theorem plays a crucial role in two key aspects. Firstly, the unknown uncertainties are estimated using Gaussian process models, which provide mean and variance information incorporated into the QP framework to determine the control inputs. The integration ensures the attainment of desired objectives with high probability. Secondly, the Bayesian optimization algorithm is employed to optimize some hyperparameters. These selected hyperparameters enhance the solvability of the QP problem and simultaneously improve the control performance of multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) interconnects multiple devices over internet, like smartphones, wearables, and smart gadgets to simplify tasks and provide convenience. However, it encounters obstacles such as privacy apprehensions arising from data aggregation, security flaws, interoperability discrepancies. Federated learning (FL) mitigates these issues by localizing data, reducing privacy risks, and securing IoT networks. It stores and updates learnt models on a central server, which is necessary for CIoT networks. Nonetheless, its application confronts problems like non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, communication efficiency, and privacy issues. According to recent research, training models using non-IID data have detrimental influence on performance, convergence, and overall model quality in FL. Moreover, traditional FL approaches, including clustered federated learning (CFL), have problems with client training and fixed hyperparameter use. This paper introduces new approach, Artificial Bee Colony Clustered Federated Learning (ABC-CFL). ABC-CFL uses Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to cluster client devices based on training hyperparameters, followed by hyperparameter optimization for each cluster to better suit each cluster using artificial bee colony algorithm. This method outperforms static hyperparameter utilization problems and improves model performance and communication efficiency in CFL as demonstrated by experiments on the CIFAR-10, MNIST and CelebA datasets.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Ventricular arrhythmias are the primary arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death. We address the problem of classification between ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) and non-ventricular rhythms (NVR). Methods: To address the challenging problem of the discrimination between VT and VF, we develop similarity maps â a novel set of features designed to capture regularity within an ECG trace. These similarity maps are combined with features extracted through learnable Parzen band-pass filters and derivative features to discriminate between VT, VF, and NVR. To combine the benefits of these different features, we propose a hierarchical multi-stream ResNet34 architecture. Results: Our empirical results demonstrate that the similarity maps significantly improve the accuracy of distinguishing between VT and VF. Overall, the proposed approach achieves an average class sensitivity of 89.68%, and individual class sensitivities of 81.46% for VT, 89.29% for VF, and 98.28% for NVR. Conclusion: The proposed method achieves a high accuracy of ventricular arrhythmia detection and classification. Significance: Correct detection and classification of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are essential for effective intervention and for the development of new therapies and translational medicine.",

    "abstract": "The unique complementarity of frame-based and event cameras for high frame rate object tracking has recently inspired some research attempts to develop multi-modal fusion approaches. However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, insufficient interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker , which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features and strengthen the target information by improving the interaction between the target template and search regions. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Assembling to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that prompt-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to emphasize target information by leveraging a contrastive learning strategy between the target template and search regions. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.

    "abstract": "Communication overhead has become one of the major bottlenecks in the distributed training of modern deep neural networks. With such consideration, various quantization-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers have been proposed and widely adopted, among which signSGD with majority vote shows a promising direction because of its communication efficiency and robustness against Byzantine attackers. However, signSGD fails to converge in the presence of data heterogeneity, which is commonly observed in the emerging federated learning (FL) paradigm. In this article, a sufficient condition for the convergence of the sign-based gradient descent method is derived, based on which a novel magnitude-driven stochastic-sign-based gradient compressor is proposed to address the non-convergence issue of signSGD. The convergence of the proposed method is established in the presence of arbitrary data heterogeneity. The Byzantine resilience of sign-based gradient descent methods is quantified, and the error-feedback mechanism is further incorporated to boost the learning performance Experimental results on the MNIST dataset, the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the Tiny-ImageNet dataset corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-speech (TTS) technology is commonly used to generate personalized voices for new speakers. Despite considerable progress in TTS technology, personal voice synthesis remains problematic in achieving high-quality custom voices. In addressing this issue, fine-tuning a TTS model is a popular approach. However, it must be applied once for every new speaker, which results in both time-consuming model training and excessive storage of the TTS model parameters. Therefore, to support a large number of new speakers, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach must be used instead of full fine-tuning, as well as an approach to accommodate multiple speakers with a small number of parameters. To this end, this work first incorporates a low-rank adaptation-based fine-tuning method for variational inference with adversarial learning for end-to-end TTS (VITS) model. Next, the approach is extended with conditional layer normalization for multi-speaker fine-tuning, and the residual adapter is further applied to the text encoder outputs of the VITS model to improve the intelligibility and naturalness of the speech quality of personalized speech. The performance of the fine-tuned TTS models with different combinations of fine-tuning modules is evaluated using the Libri-TTS-100, VCTK, and Common Voice datasets, as well as a Korean multi-speaker dataset. Objective and subjective quality comparisons reveal that the proposed approach achieves speech quality comparable to that of a fully fine-tuned model, with around a 90% reduction in the number of model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Rice is pivotal in global food security and Rice seeding detection in precision agriculture is essential for optimizing crop productivity and efficient resource use. Currently, the spatial distribution and detection of rice seeding are manually done, which is time-consuming. As technology advances, the rapid progress in precision agriculture calls for innovative solutions like lightweight edge-computing vision models for UAV intelligence. However, the limited computational capabilities of UAVs make it challenging to deploy complex object detection models onboard. This paper proposes Li-YOLOv9, an efficient, lightweight, and precise object detection model for detection of rice seedlings from large-scale UAV remote sensing data. The proposed Li-YOLOv9 includes a 3D Feature Adaptation Module (3D-FAM), Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM), Coordinate Attention Module (CAM), and DeepWise Point Convolution (DWC) modules, which offer significant advantages over the original YOLOv9. The compact Li-YOLOv9 with approximately 9 million parameters is significantly lighter than the original YOLOv9 with 60 million parameters, making it ideal for resource-efficient onboard intelligence. Li-YOLOv9 is tested and validated against a real UAV rice seedling dataset. It showcases exceptional detection capabilities, achieving impressive metrics across various performance indicators, including a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.60%, an F1-score of 96.95%, an Average Recall (AR) of 96.70%, and an Average Precision (AP) of 97.20% in comparison to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). Li-YOLOv9 is highly efficient and ideal for UAV deployment for real-time detection of rice seedlings from large-scale remote sensing data.",

    "abstract": "Directed evolution, a strategy for protein engineering, optimizes protein properties (i.e., fitness) by a rigorous and resource-intensive process of screening or selecting among a vast range of mutations. By conducting an in silico screening of sequence properties, machine learning-guided directed evolution (MLDE) can expedite the optimization process and alleviate the experimental workload. In this work, we propose a general MLDE framework in which we apply recent advancements of Deep Learning in protein representation learning and protein property prediction to accelerate the searching and optimization processes. In particular, we introduce an optimization pipeline that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to pinpoint the mutation hotspots in the sequence and then suggest replacements to improve the overall fitness. Our experiments have shown the superior efficiency and efficacy of our proposed framework in the conditional protein generation, in comparision with other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. We expect this work will shed a new light on not only protein engineering but also on solving combinatorial problems using data-driven methods.",

    "abstract": "The study introduces an innovative approach to efficient mental stress detection by combining electroencephalography (EEG) analysis with on-chip neural networks, taking advantage of EEG's temporal resolution and the computational capabilities of embedded neural networks. The proposed system utilizes behind-the-ear (BTE) EEG signals and on-chip neural networks for mental stress detection. A wearable custom-designed device captures EEG signals from a single BTE channel, performs on-chip signal-to-spectrogram conversion, and integrates a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) for stress classification. The system systematically identifies key EEG frequency bands associated with stress and includes a user-friendly smartphone application for intuitive stress monitoring. EEG data were collected from 15 participants during stress-inducing tasks, such as Stroop and Mental Arithmetic tests. On-chip processing is essential for filtering EEG noise, converting signals into spectrogram images, and using these images as inputs for stress detection through the proposed on-chip CNN model. The experimental results demonstrate strong performance: leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) achieves 91.72% accuracy, 93.74% specificity, 88.69% sensitivity, 90.43% precision, and an F1-score of 0.8955; while 10-fold cross-validation (CV) yields 95.32% accuracy, 95.89% specificity, 94.47% sensitivity, 93.95% precision, and an F1-score of 0.9421 on untrained datasets. The Beta band (13 Hz to 30 Hz) is identified as the most significant frequency band for detecting mental stress. This integration of BTE EEG analysis with on-chip CNNs represents a significant advancement in mental stress detection and has potential applications in medical assistance tools.",

    "abstract": "As a pivotal subfield within the domain of time series forecasting, runoff forecasting plays a crucial role in water resource management and scheduling. Recent advancements in the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and attention mechanisms have markedly enhanced the accuracy of runoff forecasting models. This article introduces an innovative hybrid model, ResTCN-DAM, which synergizes the strengths of deep residual network (ResNet), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and dual attention mechanisms (DAMs). The proposed ResTCN-DAM is designed to leverage the unique attributes of these three modules: TCN has outstanding capability to process time series data in parallel. By combining with modified ResNet, multiple TCN layers can be densely stacked to capture more hidden information in the temporal dimension. DAM module adeptly captures the interdependencies within both temporal and feature dimensions, adeptly accentuating relevant time steps/features while diminishing less significant ones with minimal computational cost. Furthermore, the snapshot ensemble method is able to obtain the effect of training multiple models through one single training process, which ensures the accuracy and robustness of the forecasts. The deep integration and collaborative cooperation of these modules comprehensively enhance the modelâs forecasting capability from various perspectives. Ablation studies conducted validate the efficacy of each module, and through multiple sets of comparative experiments, it is shown that the proposed ResTCN-DAM has exceptional and consistent performance across varying lead times. We also employ visualization techniques to display heatmaps of the modelâs weights, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. When compared with the prevailing neural network-based runoff forecasting models, ResTCN-DAM exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy, temporal robustness, and interpretability, positioning it at the forefront of contemporary research.",

    "abstract": "Localizing the bronchoscope in real time is essential for ensuring intervention quality. However, most existing vision-based methods struggle to balance between speed and generalization. To address these challenges, we present BronchoTrack, an innovative real-time framework for accurate branch-level localization, encompassing lumen detection, tracking, and airway association. To achieve real-time performance, we employ benchmark light weight detector for efficient lumen detection. We firstly introduce multi-object tracking to bronchoscopic localization, mitigating temporal confusion in lumen identification caused by rapid bronchoscope movement and complex airway structures. To ensure generalization across patient cases, we propose a training-free detection-airway association method based on a semantic airway graph that encodes the hierarchy of bronchial tree structures. Experiments on 11 patient datasets demonstrate BronchoTrackâs localization accuracy of 81.72%, while accessing up to the 6th generation of airways. Furthermore, we tested BronchoTrack in an in-vivo animal study using a porcine model, where it localized the bronchoscope into the 8th generation airway successfully. Experimental evaluation underscores BronchoTrackâs real-time performance in both satisfying accuracy and generalization, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Decorrelation of multichannel signals has played a crucial preprocessing role (in prewhitening and orthogonalization) for many signal processing applications. Classical decorrelation techniques can only be applied for signal vectors. Nonetheless, many emerging big-data and sensor-network applications involve signal tensors (signal samples required to be arranged in a tensor form of arbitrary orders). Meanwhile, the existing tensor-decorrelation methods have serious limitations. First, the correlation-tensors have to be of certain particular orders. Second, the unrealistic assumption of the specific signal-tensor form, namely the canonical polyadic (CP) form, is made. Third, the correlation-tensor has to be full-rank or an extra preprocessor based on principal component analysis is required for any non-full-rank correlation tensor. To remove the aforementioned impractical limitations, we propose a novel robust approach for high-dimensional multichannel decorrelation, which can accommodate signal tensors of arbitrary orders, forms, and ranks without any need of extra preprocessor. In this work, we introduce two new tensor-decorrelation algorithms. Our first new algorithm is designed to tackle full-rank correlation-tensors and our second new algorithm is designed to tackle non-full-rank correlation-tensors. Meanwhile, we also propose a new parallel-computing paradigm to accelerate our proposed new tensor-decorrelation algorithms. To demonstrate the applicability of our proposed new scheme, we also apply our proposed new tensor-decorrelation approach to pre-whiten the tensor signals and analyze the corresponding convergence-speed and misadjustment performances of the tensor least-mean-squares (TLMS) filter. Finally, we assess the computational- and memory-complexities of our proposed new algorithms by simulations over both artificial and real data. Simulation results show that our proposed new multichannel-decorrelation algorithms outperform the existing tensor-decorrel...",

    "abstract": "Nonlinearities and unknown disturbances are widely present in mechanical systems. This study investigates an improved nonlinear extended disturbance observer and its application in electro-hydraulic servo system, which represents a typical nonlinear system. The focus lies in estimating the external disturbance and its nth-order derivates of the system to enhance the robustness and precision of the control system. Additionally, we introduce a high gain observer dedicated to estimating the system's velocity. Finally, we establish a sliding mode controller based on the improved disturbance observer and high gain observer, aiming to mitigate the impact of external force disturbances. Comparative experiments have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "This article presents 3DNN-Xplorer, the first machine learning (ML)-based framework for predicting the performance of heterogeneous 3-D deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Our ML framework facilitates the design space exploration (DSE) of heterogeneous 3-D accelerators with a two-tier compute-on-memory (CoM) configuration, considering 3-D physical design factors. Our design space encompasses four distinct heterogeneous 3-D integration styles, combining 28-and 16-nm technology nodes for both compute and memory tiers. Using extrapolation techniques with ML models trained on 10-to-256 processing element (PE) accelerator configurations, we estimate the performance of systems featuring 75â16 384 PEs, achieving a maximum absolute error of 13.9% (the number of PEs is not continuous and varies based on the accelerator architecture). To ensure balanced tier areas in the design, our framework assumes the same number of PEs or on-chip memory capacity across the four integration styles, accounting for area imbalance resulting from different technology nodes. Our analysis reveals that the heterogeneous 3-D style with 28-nm compute and 16-nm memory is energy-efficient and offers notable energy savings of up to 50% and an 8.8% reduction in runtime compared to other 3-D integration styles with the same number of PEs. Similarly, the heterogeneous 3-D style with 16-nm compute and 28-nm memory is area-efficient and shows up to 8.3% runtime reduction compared to other 3-D styles with the same on-chip memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "The nominally coarse spatial resolution (300 ~ 400 km) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and a 11-month data gap with GRACE follow-on (GRACE-FO) limits applications at the individual ice sheet drainage basin scale and complicates the evaluation of regional ice sheet mass changes. While numerous works have downscaled GRACE-estimated water storage, research on downscaling ice mass change in Antarctica is limited. This study employs joint partial least squares regression (PSLR) and support vector machine (SVM) method to reconstruct GRACE-derived spatiotemporal data for the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS). The pixel-temporal downscaling (PTD) of Random Forest (RF) and pixel-spatial downscaling (PSD) of Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) enhance spatial resolution of ice mass changes from 0.25Â° (~120 km) to 1.92 km. The downscaled results show consistent temporal variation and reduced noise compared to other reconstruction methods. Both RF and MGWR results exhibit high consistency with original GRACE data, with MGWR achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The MGWR model effectively captures finer signals related to ice flow velocity. When compared to independent free air gravity anomalies, MGWR outperforming RF with improvements of 41.51% and 56.25% in mean correlation for group 1 and group 2 observation points, respectively. Additionally, MGWR shows improvements of 16.90%/29.69% for flight Line A and 11.84%/19.72% for flight Line B compared to RF and original GRACE results. The enhanced spatial resolution offers valuable insights into ice dynamic changes within the Wester AIS and Eastern AIS and smaller regions like the Antarctic Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have vastly improved. AI is now being used in a variety of applications to diagnose Breast Cancer (BC). However, most of the recent research has focused on centralized learning, which can pose privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework for the BC classification systems. The main objectives of this research are to improve data security and privacy, increase the accuracy of the Deep Learning (DL) model, and minimize energy consumption and related carbon emissions, which provides a way toward achieving green AI and sustainability goals. However, continuously transmitting model updates between the client and the server may cause lag and escalate host energy consumption. To minimize communication cost and simultaneously achieve the best accuracy, the proposed FL framework develops a new DL architecture for mammography classification, taking into account the optimal number of rounds between client hosts and the central server. The proposed DL architecture employs attention mechanisms, convolutional layers, and LSTMs to extract and analyze features and uses techniques to prevent overfitting and manage imbalanced data. The proposed FL framework is evaluated on three benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the proposed framework is more effective in detecting breast cancer compared to the recent approaches, achieving 95.17%, 100%, and 98.82% on the DDSM, INbreast, and Macrocalcification datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ), a globally cultivated spice crop, is vital to numerous economies. However, its production faces significant challenges due to pests and diseases, which can lead to substantial yield losses. Traditional methods for detecting these threats often rely on visual inspection by human experts, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. This article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these limitations and transform ginger cultivation. It provides a comprehensive analysis of conventional pest and disease management strategies, identifying their short comings and exploring the potential of emerging AI technologies, including the AI of thingsâ applications, for accurate, efficient, and timely detection and control. By pinpointing the challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research, this study aims to equip agriculturists and researchers with the knowledge necessary to optimize ginger production, enhance food security, and foster sustainable farming practices.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the robust impetus from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged as a nascent computing paradigm, synthesizing AI with edge computing (EC) to become an exemplary solution for unleashing the full potential of AI services. Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the systemâs adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficiency. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research, with the hope of arousing the research communityâs interest in this emerging and exciting interdisciplinary field.",

    "abstract": "Piecewise linear neural networks (PLNNs) are proven universal approximators for continuous functions on the compact domain. For multiple PLNNs (mPLNNs) differing from each other in suffering different approximation errors (AEs) when approximating the same continuous function, activating all the PLNNs to approximate the continuous function, and then, picking up the minimum AE (MAE) from all the AEs seems to be a practical way to arrive at such MAE. Activating PLNNs has to consume energy, and more activated PLNNs provide more AEs to consider, which can maximize the probability of guaranteeing the MAE, while also needing to harvest more energy. Therefore, how to make the optimal tradeoff between energy harvested and approximation accuracy for mPLNNs arises as an interesting issue. To address this problem, this paper first deduces the objective function, with the accumulative probability of obtaining the MAE as the objective and the accumulative energy harvested as the constraint, then reveals the optimal probability that each hidden neuron (HN) in the activated PLNN should be activated, and finally uncovers the optimal activation probability for each PLNN. An algorithm based on our discovered theoretical results is proposed for mPLNNs to enjoy the maximum probability of achieving the MAE at the acceptable level of accumulative energy harvested. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify its performance. Note to Practitioners âThis paper addresses the interesting issue of how to make mPLNNs approximate the continuous function with the highest approximation accuracy under the energy constraint. Through the insightful discovery of the optimal activation probability for each HN in the activated PLNN as well as the optimal activation probability for each PLNN, this paper facilitates mPLNNs to suffer the MAE in their approximations to continuous functions, with the maximum probability while maintaining the energy harvested within a given range. Because PLNNs can model the ...",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving significantly benefits from datadriven deep neural networks. However, the data in autonomous driving typically fits the long-tailed distribution, in which the critical driving data in adverse conditions is hard to collect. Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to augment data for autonomous driving, generating driving images in adverse conditions is still challenging. In this work, we propose a novel framework, SUSTechGAN, with customized dual attention modules, multi-scale generators, and a novel loss function to generate driving images for improving object detection of autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We test the SUSTechGAN and the well-known GANs to generate driving images in adverse conditions of rain and night and apply the generated images to retrain object detection networks. Specifically, we add generated images into the training datasets to retrain the well-known YOLOv5 and evaluate the improvement of the retrained YOLOv5 for object detection in adverse conditions. The experimental results show that the generated driving images by our SUSTechGAN significantly improved the performance of retrained YOLOv5 in rain and night conditions, which outperforms the well-known GANs. The open-source code, video description and datasets are available on the page 1 to facilitate image generation development in autonomous driving under adverse conditions",

    "abstract": "In the contemporary digital landscape, individuals often fall victim to various forms of deception through the dissemination of fraudulent messages. Unaware of these types of spurious messages, people frequently engage with the links provided by cybercriminals, leading to financial losses or involvement in distressing incidents. Recognizing the urgency of addressing this issue, it becomes imperative to detect and identify such fraudulent or spam messages before they reach usersâ inboxes. This paper proposes the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) â SHAP based feature selection framework ( FSSHAP ) for the classification of spam messages using the Random Forest algorithm. The model relies on the selection of significant hand-crafted features based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and the features are selected based on the threshold value determined using SHAP values. The research uses three different datasets, including the SMSs in Dravidian Languages like Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, and Malayalam. The traditional feature selection techniques are compared with the proposed FSSHAP values approach in various performance metrics. This comprehensive approach aims to mitigate the impact of fraudulent messages, safeguarding users from potential harm in the digital realm.",

    "abstract": "Deepfakes are a form of synthetic media that uses deep-learning technology to create fake images, video, and audio. The emergence of this technology has inspired much commentary and speculation from academics across a range of disciplines, who have contributed expert opinions regarding the implications of deepfake proliferation on fields such as law, politics, and entertainment. A systematic scoping review was carried out to identify, assemble, and critically analyze those academic narratives. The aim is to build on and critique previous attempts at defining the technology and categorizing the harms and benefits of deepfake technology. A range of databases were searched for relevant articles from 2017 to 2023, resulting in a large multi-disciplinary dataset of 102 papers, 181,659 words long, which were analyzed qualitatively through thematic analysis. Implications for future research include questioning the lack of research evidence for the supposed positives of deepfakes, recognizing the role that identity plays in deepfake technology, challenging the perceived accessibility/ believability of deepfakes, and proposing a more nuanced approach to the dichotomous âpositive and negativesâ of deepfakes. Furthermore, we show how definitional issues around what a deepfake is versus other forms of fake media feeds confusion around the novelty and impacts of deepfakes.",

    "abstract": "A community is only as strong as its weakest link; this principle also applies to student communities in the educational field. The quality of learning achieved by students in a course is directly related to the performance of the weakest student in that course. Therefore, a high number of students failing a course and the necessity of repeating it are undesirable in terms of learning quality. This study aims to predict studentsâ performance early during their coursework to identify those at risk of failing, thus improving the quality of the course and determining the necessary resources to achieve this goal. To this end, we proposed a conceptual model based on a hybrid method combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To evaluate the classification performance of the model, comparisons were made with classical machine learning and deep learning models. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) methods were used to determine the contribution of different features to the modelâs predictions. Additionally, to assess the generalizability and applicability of the model, the widely used xAPI-Edu-Data dataset, which covers various courses, was employed, and the accuracy results of the model were compared with early prediction studies published in the literature. As a result, it was found that our prediction model performed 6% better than the classical models and achieved better results than most of the models, except for two models in the literature with similar results. Moreover, important performance features that can be used to evaluate students earlier in the course were identified.",

    "abstract": "Environmental pollution often results from numerous human actions. Researchers have studied the risks and impacts of harmful pollutants and environmental contamination for years, leading to the implementation of several critical measures. New solutions are continuously advanced to tackle this problem effectively. Visual pollution extends outside advertising, demonstrated in numerous forms through natural areas, urban, and roadways. Among the plethora of various procedures of visual pollution, environmental pollution worsens the aesthetics of the city, approving the significance of investigation and evaluating it from multiple dimensions. Building automated pollutants or pollution detection methods became progressively popular owing to the present growth of improved artificial intelligence methods. While some developments are made, automatic pollution detection must still be fully understood and well-researched. Therefore, this study focuses on designing and developing the Modeling of Computer Vision with Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Visual Pollution Detection (MCVXAI-VPD) model. The MCVXAI-VPD model involves DL-based object detection and classification with a hyperparameter tuning strategy. In the developed MCVXAI-VPD methodology, an original pre-processing stage occurs in two levels: mean filter (MF)-based noise removal and CLAHE-based contrast enhancement. Next, the MCVXAI-VPD model applies a YOLOv5 object detector with a backbone network combination of CSP and SPP to effectually detect the target objects. Besides, the MCVXAI-VPD model performs a classification process using deep learning depending on bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Additionally, the prairie dog optimization (PDO) technique is exploited as a hyperparameter tuning process of the BiLSTM model to accomplish enhanced classification performance. At last, the MCVXAI-VPD methods integrate the XAI model LIME to enhance the explainability and understanding of the black-box techniq...",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is a prevalent and serious respiratory condition linked to cardiovascular morbidity. Polysomnography, the standard diagnostic approach, faces challenges in accessibility and complexity, leading to underdiagnosis. To simplify OSA diagnosis, deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed using cardiac signals, but they often lack interpretability. Our study introduces a novel interpretable DL approach (SleepECG-Net) for directly estimating OSA severity in at-risk children. A combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN-RNN) was trained on overnight electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm, was applied to explain model decisions and extract ECG patterns relevant to pediatric OSA. Accordingly, ECG signals from the semi-public Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT, n = 1610) and Cleveland Family Study (CFS, n = 64), and the private University of Chicago (UofC, n = 981) databases were used. OSA diagnostic performance reached 4-class Cohen's Kappa of 0.410, 0.335, and 0.249 in CHAT, UofC, and CFS, respectively. The proposal demonstrated improved performance with increased severity along with heightened cardiovascular risk. XAI findings highlighted the detection of established ECG features linked to OSA, such as bradycardia-tachycardia events and delayed ECG patterns during apnea/hypopnea occurrences, focusing on clusters of events. Furthermore, Grad-CAM heatmaps identified potential ECG patterns indicating cardiovascular risk, such as P, T, and U waves, QT intervals, and QRS complex variations. Hence, SleepECG-Net approach may improve pediatric OSA diagnosis by also offering cardiac risk factor information, thereby increasing clinician confidence in automated systems, and promoting their effective adoption in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models offer a promising alternative to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for resource allocation in wireless networks due to their capability to model complex data distributions with greater accuracy, yet their potential remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based approach for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) to minimize power consumption by optimizing the sampling period, blocklength, and packet error probability within the finite blocklength regime. The problem is simplified to optimizing blocklength through optimality conditions, and a dataset of channel gains and optimal blocklengths is generated via an optimization theory-based solution. The Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is employed to generate optimal blocklength values, conditioned on channel state information (CSI). The core idea is to train the diffusion model to generate blocklength values from noise, essentially replicating the process by which the optimization solution is derived. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed approach surpasses existing DRL-based methods, achieving near-optimal performance in terms of total power consumption. Additionally, the proposed method reduces critical constraint violations by up to eighteen times, further highlighting the enhanced accuracy of the solution.",

There is a need for an optimized inference scheme that can efficiently perform conditional computation in on-device object detection. This letter proposes a predictor which can predict router decisions of conditional computation. Based on the predictor, this letter also presents an inference scheme which hides router latency through concurrently executing router and the predicted branch. The proposed predictor shows higher accuracy than profiling-based method, and experiment shows that our inference scheme can get latency decrease over traditional scheme.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing Urdu text in natural images is more challenging as compared to other languages, such as English, due to the cursive nature of Urdu script. However, Urdu scene text has not received enough attention from both industry and academia due to the lack of the dataset of Urdu text. We propose a large-scale Urdu Scene Text Dataset (USTD) to address this problem, which is designed for Urdu scene text detection and recognition. The proposed dataset contains 29674 text annotations (17877 Urdu and 11797 English), 749725 characters in 6389 images. It covers a wide variety of text images with both Nastaleeq and Naskh writing styles, taken from different streets and roads of Pakistan. The vast diversity of this dataset makes it a benchmark to work on and train robust neural networks for the detection and recognition of cursive text. Besides, baseline results are also provided with several state-of-the-art networks, including TextBoxes++, Seglink, DB(ResNet-50) and EAST for text localization and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for text recognition. To further evaluate the performance of these models, we have used the most popular evaluation matrices of precision, recall, and F-measure. Our experimental outputs reveal that an end-to-end combination of DB(ResNet-50) and CRNN provides the best results with precision, recall, and F-measure of 0.7526, 0.5974, and 0.6660, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Effective connectivity estimation plays a crucial role in understanding the interactions and information flow between different brain regions. However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment. Note to Practitioners âDiagnosing MCI allows for timely intervention and treatment measures to potentially slow down or even halt further cognitive decline. Exploring causal relations between brain regions enables a better understanding of pathogenic mechani...",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence(GAI) models such as ChatGPT , DALL-E , and the recently introduced Gemini have attracted considerable interest in both business and academia because of their capacity to produce material in response to human inputs. Cognitive computing is a broader field of machine learning that encompasses GAI, which particularly emphasizes systems capable of creating content, such as images, text, or sound, while semantic computing acts as a fundamental element of GAI, furnishing the comprehension of context and significance essential for GAI systems to generate content akin to human-like standards. GAI is becoming a game-changing technology for consumer electronics industry with a variety of applications that improve user experiences and product development. GAI can revolutionise architectural visualisation by facilitating quick prototyping and the investigation of cutting-edge design ideas. By creating unique compositions and graphics for a variety of applications, it also empowers media production and music composition. Our research identifies several applications of GAI in the consumer electronics industry. We analyze how GAI is utilized in augmented reality (AR) applications, optimizing user interactions and immersive experiences. Moreover, we explore the integration of GAI in voice assistants and virtual avatars, enhancing images, natural language understanding and delivering more personalized interactions. We present a novel case study on a Generative Artificial Intelligence-based Framework for answering consumer electronics queries. We have developed and presented the system using various GAI-based tools and integrations. The paper also discusses the challenges in implementing GAI in consumer electronics, such as ethical considerations, data privacy, compatibility with existing systems, and the need for continuous updates and improvements.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents graph neural networks (GNNs)-based fault diagnostic framework (GFDF) with cyber-attack detection capabilities for ac microgrids (MGs). GFDF employs GNNs on graphical representation of MGs, augmented with a multi-head attention mechanism, to accurately assimilate dynamics associated with fault events by learning node embeddings. This approach effectively assigns weights to the neighboring nodes based on their contributions, ensuring resilience to abnormal data and adaptability to changing operating conditions. GFDF uses current measurement of single end of each line and line parameters as graph node and link attributes, respectively. Additionally, this paper proposes a robust intelligence-based centralized protection scheme (ICPS), intended to address the failure of legacy protection infrastructure in MGs caused by various logical and physical reasons. It utilizes decisions made by GFDF with accelerated computation throughput using dedicated hardware (GPU-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650) to meet stringent protection time requirements. A comparative assessment of GFDF with the existing techniques, and the implementation of ICPS on medium voltage CIGRE MGs through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation, leveraging real-time digital simulator (RTDS) setup, and commercial SEL relays to emulate realistic operational environments, validates the practicality of the work.",

While these GenAI models have impressive capabilities, their computational intensity has presented issues, especially in applications demanding low latency. Hence, substantial research is being conducted to develop ways to scale down these models so that they may be used for on-device computing on edge devices. Examining successful examples of GenAI models implemented on mobile devices with minimum latency becomes critical in understanding the practical consequences of these breakthroughs. Notable instances, such as the deployment of Diffusion-based GenAI models on flagship smartphones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14, demonstrate the possibility and promise of bringing GenAI applications to consumers' fingertips. We further analyze and find out the approaches and strategies that make these on-device deployments successful.",

    "abstract": "Accurate long-range object detection is essential for applications such as security and surveillance. However, existing datasets often lack the complexity needed to represent real-world outdoor environments, resulting in limited performance of object detection algorithms at extended distances.Synthetic data generation offers a way to address these limitations by creating varied and realistic training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach utilizing BlenderProc procedural generation and photorealistic rendering to create a synthetic dataset that captures diverse and realistic outdoor scenes for the objects detection. We trained YOLO model on this dataset and compared its performance with standard YOLO model. Our approach achieved a precision of 94% and recall of 96% for detecting objects at distances exceeding 120 meters, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. These findings underscore the potential of advanced synthetic data generation techniques to enhance long-range object detection and address critical challenges in surveillance, remote sensing, and autonomous systems.",

    "abstract": "The human brain is exceedingly good at learning rich narratives from highly limited experiences. One of the ways this is achieved in our brain is through neuromodulators or neurotransmitters, like dopamine and nor-epinephrine, in cortical circuits. In terms of symbolic processing, these neuromodulators add âsalienceâ to various emotions and experiences. A salience-based neural network (SANN) architecture was proposed in [1]. We have taken this architecture and have developed a discriminator to enable efficient change detection for underwater applications. In the context of underwater, surveillance can be elucidated as one of the processes of detecting and tracking the moving objects present in underwater videos. Several researchers working on the same tried to develop different techniques for identifying moving objects from outdoor scenes. However, while applying the same for underwater environments, it is found to be unable to preserve the minute details that are important for definin...",

    "abstract": "Binary obfuscation techniques are commonly employed to protect code against reverse engineering and piracy. Unfortunately, besides being used for legitimate purposes, virus writers also resort to obfuscation to evade antivirus detection mechanisms based on signature scanning. Consequently, the detection of obfuscated code in executables may be a precious resource to prevent the execution of malicious programs. Detecting obfuscation is a task fraught with difficulties owing to the wide range of possible obfuscation transformations and the indistinguishability of obfuscated code. In this paper, we venture into the not-so-explored world of obfuscation detection, gaining a deeper comprehension of what happens - from a statistical perspective - to a binary program when obfuscation transformations are applied to it. We accomplish this goal by leveraging eXplainable Artificial Intelligence, which allows us to discern the altered features from the invariant ones, which in turn can then be used for obfuscation-resilient malware detection. The present study has been carried out utilizing diverse datasets, not only to examine the detection of obfuscation but also to classify the specific obfuscating transformations employed. The investigation encompasses binaries compiled for various architectures, and we propose an effective methodology for identifying both the existence of obfuscation and isolating invariant patterns that can facilitate the creation of obfuscation-resistant signatures for antivirus detection.",

    "abstract": "While ensemble methods can tackle concept drifts, obtaining pretrained models and conducting ensemble learning upon streamed data impose fundamental challenges, including the dynamic balance between system overhead and inference accuracy in uncertain system environments, and the interlacement between desired economic properties and long-term participation. In this paper, we propose the joint optimization which enables service providers to obtain models via repetitive auctions from the model providers and conduct ensemble methods online in a cost-efficient manner. We design polynomial-time online algorithms to solve the underlying non-linear mixed-integer social cost minimization problem, involving bid selection, payment allocation, model hosting, and ensemble model-weight adaption. We further rigorously prove the performance guarantees with our approach, such as the sub-linear dynamic regret for the bidding cost, the sub-linear dynamic fit for the long-term participation constraint, the truthfulness and the individual rationality for the auctions, the upper bound for ensemble inference loss, and the parameterized-constant competitive ratio for the long-term social cost. Through extensive trace-driven evaluations under real-world settings, we have validated the significant advantages of our approach over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion has become a universal phenomenon in metropolitan cities. The prevalence of congested roads not only results in delays, increased fuel consumption, environmental pollution, and a reduced quality of life, but also contributes to lowered productivity due to the time wasted in the search for available street parking. Current solutions are either tailored solely for detecting vacant spaces within parking lots or rely on unfeasible street sensors and stationary surveillance cameras, falling short in accurately pinpointing individual free street parking spots. In this paper, we introduce an innovative street parking detection and localization system designed to cater to both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. Our solution is specifically engineered to be integrated into modern vehicles, utilizing the live video feed from the car's built-in navigation and obstacle avoidance cameras. This approach combines convolutional neural networks, our video global motion analysis, and an innovative distance measurement technique to achieve accurate detection and precise localization of unoccupied street parking spaces. Our solution eliminates the impact of vehicle speed, duplicate detection of identical parking spots during sudden stops, and delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining low computational costs and complexity. We also introduce a unique dataset tailored for this objective, serving as the cornerstone for training and assessing well established object detection network architectures. Performance evaluations confirm the proposed method's efficacy across all types of scenarios",

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with their advantage of communication coverage and channel quality, have become an effective paradigm for anti-jamming through data relay. However, current research primarily focuses on transmitting devices in stationary environments. When these devices are in motion, such as in the case of UAVs performing data relay, they may encounter challenges including degradation in channel quality and failures in coverage. In this paper, we propose employing a UAV to consistently track mobile devices(MDs), ensuring superior channel quality while simultaneously providing data relay. To address the unpredictable movement of MDs and varying jamming power, we formulate the UAVâs interaction within the existing environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach involves joint optimization of UAV flight speed, direction, and relay decisions to minimize data transmission delay. We then propose the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to account for the non-convexity of the optimization problem. Additionally, we consider the complexity and frequency of the action space, decomposing it, and optimizing it by alternating between upper and lower-level policies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can quickly converge to the optimal solution, significantly reducing data transmission delays.",

    "abstract": "Due to the reliability and efficiency of keystroke dynamics, enterprises have adopted it widely in multi-factor authentication systems, effectively strengthening user authentication and thereby boosting the security of online and offline services. The existing works that detect imposter users suffer from performance and robustness degradation. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel methodology to enhance user authentication and identify imposter users who attempt to have unauthorized access. We first use quantile transformation (QT) to mitigate outliers in the user's typing behavior that affects the authentication process and then employ conditional tabular generative adversarial networks (CTGAN) for data augmentation to learn the users' typing patterns better. Next, five accurate transfer learning models (VGG19, EfficientNetB0, Resnet50, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121) are utilized for extracting effective features within the typing patterns, so our methodology can detect imposter users accurately and hence make precise decisions to enhance the user authentication process. Finally, we ensure transparency and trust in our user authentication methodology by incorporating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), utilizing local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Extensive experiments using a publicly available keystroke dynamics benchmark dataset from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) showcase superior security performance and robustness using the proposed methodology compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Robot perception difficulties in complex environments seriously affect robot operational efficiency. The application of generative big model (GBM) technology on robots through the agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) can solve the difficulty of low operational efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic decision-making localization algorithm for robots fused with generative big models in agriculture Internet of Things. First, in the agriculture Internet of Things, the complex agricultural scene information is acquired in real-time by the Realsense D435i equipped on the robot, which is accessed in the GBM through a proprietary network to realize real-time intelligent sensing and control between the environmental information and the robot. Then, the innovative reinforcement learning method based on human solid feedback (S-RLHF) and the automatic generation method of weakly supervised fine-tuning data (WS-FT DAGM) are designed in the generative large model. At the same time, by combining the characteristics of the robot operation, two generative significant model recommendation methods are designed, which solves the problem of the difficulty of the target perception in the complex agricultural scene. Finally, by integrating the agriculture Internet of Things and generative large models, the critical method of real-time analysis of crop shading characteristics by the large model is innovatively proposed to solve the problem of low efficiency in robot operation. In the robot test experiments, the operation efficiency using the fusion of agriculture Internet of Things and generative large model reaches more than 92%, significantly improving the operation efficiency compared to the small model (CNN) method without agriculture Internet of Things and generative large model in the traditional agricultural robot.",

    "abstract": "Vascular interventional surgery offers advantages, such as minimal invasiveness, quick recovery, and low side-effects. Performing automatic guidewire navigation on vascular surgical robots can effectively assist doctors in performing surgery. Deep learning and reinforcement learning methods have been widely used for guidewire navigation tasks. However, the challenge remains in making delivery decisions for complex and extended pathways, with real-time images being the only data source. The development of network architecture, coupled with the formulation of an efficacious training regimen for this network is of significant importance and holds substantial meaning for the advancement of autonomous systems in vascular surgical robots. Therefore, this research proposes a virtual training environment that incorporates real vascular projections to create virtual environment. In this environment, the approach is enhanced by incorporating guidewire tip-to-target distance in the reward function, using real-time images as input states. This article also employs a multiprocess proximal policy optimization algorithm to accelerate training process and a multistage training approach to reduce the training difficulty. Results demonstrate the effectiveness in virtual automated guidewire navigation and improves success rates. This research proposes a method, which generates effective inputs for the reinforcement learning agent, and enables the pretrained agent to accomplish delivery tasks in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The dominance of microservices-based development frameworks and the development of complex distributed applications, along with the massive production of powerful Internet of things (IoT) and edge computing devices, are paving the way toward the transition from centralized to distributed computing paradigms, where applications are deployed across the computing continuum. In the computing continuum, we consider the management of resources from the IoT to the edge to the cloud part of the infrastructure. To achieve effective management of resources and application workloads, a set of challenges have been identified. These challenges revolve around the need to introduce automation and distributed intelligence characteristics into emerging orchestration mechanisms. To treat this, the design of synergetic or cooperative orchestration mechanisms that take advantage of artificial intelligence techniques is arising as a promising approach. In this article, we describe the design and development of a synergetic orchestration mechanism, powered by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), to guide the autoscaling of distributed applications that are deployed across the computing continuum. A MARL environment and a corresponding agent have been developed and applied in real and simulated environments to guide scaling actions, while indicative evaluation results are provided.",

    "abstract": "The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely deployed for the emergency communication recovery in 6G-enabled internet of vehicles (IoV) networks for Industry 5.0 due to its advantages such as high mobility, low cost and on-demand deployment. However, in a practical three-dimensional (3D) space urban road scenario, the obstructions from the buildings or interchange bridges, as well as the limited transmit power and quantity of UAVs, cannot satisfy the vehiclesâ communication quality of service (QoS) for UAV-assisted IoV networks. To address these challenges, we propose a QoS-aware UAVs 3D coverage deployment algorithm (QUCDA) to maximize the number of vehicles covered by UAVs based on the machine learning algorithms. The QUCDA takes into account the unique 3D urban environment characteristics and the QoS requirements of IoV networks, which are crucial factors that traditional optimization algorithms often overlook. More specifically, the proposed QUCDA improves on traditional genetic algorithm (GA) and consists of two key steps: first, a novel approach is developed to generate the initial population utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm to improve the quality of the solution. Subsequently, we propose the K-means initialized grey wolf optimization (KIGWO) algorithm to improve the diversity through a random replacement strategy. The experimental evaluation is conducted using a realistic 3D urban environment dataset, including the road locations, heights, and other environment details. Abundant simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional GA, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), the proposed QUCDA can make the communication coverage reach 100%, effectively improve the system capacity and the coverage rate. The result is expected to be useful for achieving future smart city in 6G-enabled IoV networks for Industry 5.0.",

    "abstract": "Automated greenhouse gases are essential for sustainable development and food security. PV powered greenhouse with physical sensors-based control using Internet of Things (IoT) needs high initial investment and operational cost. This also needs significant installed storage capacity. In the proposed solution, the dependency on physical sensors like temperature, humidity, soil moisture sensors, etc. are eliminated due to the application of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) based machine learning (ML) algorithm. The training and testing of ML algorithm are performed with one-year physical data (approx. 50k @10min interval) from greenhouse which provides accurate mapping (Temperature MAPE: 1.51%, R2: 0.9785 and Humidity MAPE: 1.68%, R2: 0.9867) between predicted and sensor data. Also, a novel priority-based demand side management (DSM) scheme is implemented which includes load shifting which reduces the requirement of installed PV and storage capacity. A reduction of 63.27% storage capacity is possible with proposed control approach. ML algorithm is programmed using Python language and implemented in Raspberry Pi-3B+ SBC. For physical verification of proposed control unit, a laboratory-based prototype is developed with PV emulator (1.5 kW), programmable electronic load box, and relay unit controlled through Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi-3B+ SBC, ESP-32 Combo unit.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) expands its potential by providing ideal communication and data sharing across devices, allowing more considerable monitoring and management in Consumer Electronics (CE). WSNs have an essential limitation in terms of energy resources since sensor nodes frequently run on limited power from batteries. This limitation necessitates the consideration of energy-efficient techniques to extend the networkâs lifetime. In this article, an integrated approach has been presented to improve the energy efficiency of Wireless Sensor IoT Networks (WSINs) by leveraging modern machine learning algorithms with stochastic optimization. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is utilized for the feature selection thus optimizing the input features for various machine learning models. These models are rigorously evaluated for their aptness to predict and mitigate energy consumption concerns inside WSINs. Subsequently, the stochastic optimization technique utilizes the uniform and normal distributions to model energy consumption situations. The results show that RFE-driven feature selection has significant effects on model performance and that Random Forest is effective at reaching higher accuracy. This research provides valuable perspectives for the design and implementation of WSINs in CE, supporting sustainable smart devices, by addressing energy consumption concerns using an optimized approach.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is considered one of the most dangerous cancers, with a 5-year survival rate, ranking the disease among the top three deadliest cancers globally. Effectively combating lung cancer requires early detection for timely targeted interventions. However, ensuring early detection poses a major challenge, giving rise to innovative approaches. The emergence of artificial intelligence offers revolutionary solutions for predicting cancer. While marking a significant healthcare shift, the imperative to enhance artificial intelligence models remains a focus, particularly in precision medicine. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning model, incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM), designed for lung cancer detection from patients' medical notes. Comparative analysis with the MIMIC IV dataset reveals the model's superiority, achieving an MCC of 96.2% with an Accuracy of 98.1%, and outperforming LSTM and BioBERT with an MCC of 93.5 %, an accuracy of 97.0% and MCC of 95.5 with an accuracy of 98.0% respectively. Another comprehensive comparison was conducted with state-of-the-art results using the Yelp Review Polarity dataset. Remarkably, our model significantly outperforms the compared models, showcasing its superior performance and potential impact in the field. This research signifies a significant stride toward precise and early lung cancer detection, emphasizing the ongoing necessity for Artificial Intelligence model refinement in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) holds great promise for assessing battery degradation. Nevertheless, many present methods for extracting battery aging features from EIS data are unsuitable for cells that have very different aging behaviour. Another challenge is that the time complexity of machine learning (ML) models based on full-frequency EIS significantly increases. To tackle these issues, this paper investigates two feature extraction methods together with suitable regression algorithms. Firstly, manual feature extraction methods are studied that involve feature extraction via feature correlation and consistency analysis, enhancing the robustness of battery capacity estimation within Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. On the other hand, automatic feature extraction methods extract latent features using convolutional neural networks (CNN) as inputs to the model. Best results are achieved with the CNN-based methods that achieve robust capacity estimation with 2.88 % accuracy for different battery cells at varying temperatures while remaining insensitive to EIS measurement uncertainty. This is a factor of 2 to 3 more accurate than existing published approaches on the same dataset. By combining the advantages of manual and automatic feature extraction approaches, a reduced EIS data set is used to train a lightweight CNN model, resulting in an inference time of less than 21.48 ms on STM32L476RG, whereas existing approaches take up to 50 ms for achieving a similar accuracy.",

    "abstract": "To reduce redundant traffic transmission in both wired and wireless networks, optimal content placement problem naturally occurring in many applications is studied. In this paper, considering the limited cache capacity, unknown popularity distribution and non-stationary user demands, we address this problem by jointly optimizing content caching and routing with the objective of minimizing transmission cost. By optimizing the routing with the route-to-least cost-cache policy, the content caching process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), aiming to maximize caching reward. However, the optimization problem consists of multiple nodes selecting caching contents, which leads to the combinatorial increase of the number of action dimensions with the number of possible actions. To handle this curse of dimensionality, we propose an intelligent caching algorithm by embedding action branching architecture into a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) to optimize caching decisions, and thus the agent at the controller can adaptively learn and track the underlying dynamics. Considering the independence of each branch, a marginal gain-based replacement rule is proposed to satisfy cache capacity constraint. Our simulation results show that compared with the prior art, the caching reward and hit rate of the proposed algorithm are increased by 35.3% and 33.6% respectively on average.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of intelligent sensing capabilities and super computation power in 6G mobile communication systems has facilitated their application in diverse domains such as smart health, smart factories, and the industrial Internet of Things. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), as a core technology, has merged with artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent connectivity, leading to a paradigm shift in traditional communication modes. This paper presents a visionary design for an ISAC-oriented unified IoT architecture that integrates software-defined communication and super-intelligent agents. By leveraging dynamic adaptability, self-learning, and optimization, the ISAC system can intelligently and flexibly respond to evolving requirements and environments. The architecture is redefined into three layers: the hardware layer, the omniscient layer, and the application layer. Furthermore, a retrospective survey of ISAC technology development over the past decade is conducted, highlighting new design principles for AI-empowered networks and multi-modals that support âintelligent connectivity\" across various application scenarios and reinforce the security of ISAC. This paper categorizes the related works according to the different layer structures of the proposed architecture, and some important physical and machine learning models are introduced. Additionally, we summarize the current technological bottlenecks associated with ISAC and propose future research directions and potential solutions that lay the foundation for the future development of secure and intelligent communication networks.",

Despite a diverse assortment of machine learning fairness solutions is proposed in the literature, there is reportedly a lack of practical implementation of these tools in real-world applications. Industry experts have participated in thorough discussions on the challenges associated with operationalising fairness in the development of machine learning-empowered solutions, in which a shift toward human-centred approaches is promptly dvocated to mitigate the limitations of existing techniques. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for fairness auditing, presenting a mixed visual analytical system (hereafter referred to as âFairCompassâ), which integrates both subgroup discovery technique and the decision tree-based schema for end users. Moreover, we innovatively integrate an Exploration, Guidan...",

    "abstract": "AI technology has been often employed to establish knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model, which can be used for link prediction on medical knowledge graph to help medical decision-making and disease prediction. However, traditional knowledge graph completion models usually focus on exploiting simple structural features during the phase of feature learning while neglecting the complex structural feature. Considering AI-generated content (AIGC) has shown great potentials for healthcare electronics (HE), a knowledge graph embedding model with AIGC called SEConv is proposed for medical knowledge graph completion. Firstly, a less resource-consuming model of self-attention mechanism is introduced to generate more expressive embedding representations, which contributes to deploying on resource-limited consumer electronics. Secondly, in order to extract more informative features from the triplets, a multilayer convolutional neural network is adopted to learn deeper structural features. Experiments have been implemented on the medical dataset of UMLS and DBpedia50, and other two benchmark datasets. And the results show that SEConv excels in learning more expressive and discriminative feature representations. Compared with the baseline models, SEConv achieves a substantial improvement, which verifies it can be used for healthcare prediction task and smart healthcare treatments.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), IoT devices find applications in various domains. The data generated by these devices is utilized for analysis and services, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to IoT, known as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). The enhancement of edge device computing power in the IoT has led to the emergence of research areas like edge-cloud synergy AI theories and application services. In the context of lifelong learning and real-time processes in AIoT edge-cloud synergy services, addressing unseen tasks becomes crucial. Unseen tasks arise when inference requests from edge devices involve models not present in the cloudâs model repository. Addressing these challenges involves generating data to either augment small sample problems or alter the data distribution for heterogeneous sample issues. As the application of large language models (LLMs) for data generation gains traction, challenges emerge in the context of AIoT edge-cloud synergy services. Firstly, fine-tuning LLMs with heterogeneous data exacerbates model bias issues. Secondly, the substantial data requirements for training LLMs pose a contradiction. Lastly, the involvement of manual annotation in LLM-based data generation introduces complexity and cost. This paper proposes a framework Seafarer to these challenges using Generative Adversarial Networks and Self-taught Learning. Seafarer avoids model bias, reduces data requirements, and eliminates the need for manual annotation. The design demonstrates effectiveness theoretically and is validated on the Cityscapes dataset, achieving an 80% reduction in training loss and improved validation loss stability.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) play a crucial role in developing disruptive healthcare technologies since they address the needs of consumers by providing precise and effective diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. The influence of these factors on diagnosing and making decisions is especially noteworthy when collecting valuable information from healthcare data. This work offers âACâ (Accurate Cardiac Classification), a hybrid deep learning model that correctly detects cardiovascular disease (CVD) and provides meaningful insights. Convolutional neural networks and the Light Gradient Boosting Model integrate well in the âACâ model, simplifying feature learning and predictions. Using the CDCâs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, the proposed method outperforms current algorithms in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This dataset collects reliable, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors related to chronic illnesses, injuries, and avoidable infections in adults, catering to the information needs of healthcare consumers. The âACâ modelâs outstanding forecast accuracy is further improved by integrating an explainable AI methodology, specifically emphasizing SHAPâs local and global explanations. These explanatory insights clarify the modelâs decision-making process. With healthcare technologyâs advancement and the requirement for efficient data analysis to gather information, the âACâ modelâs accuracy and comprehensibility may substantially improve healthcare professionalsâ diagnosis and treatment skills, benefiting healthcare consumers.",

    "abstract": "Currently, we are living in a data-centric era as the need for large amounts of data has dramatically increased due to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of technology domains. In the current computing architecture, the memory input and output (I/O) bandwidth is becoming a bottleneck for improving computing performance; therefore, high-bandwidth memory interfaces are essential. In addition, the high power consumption of data centers to edge AI devices will lead to power shortages and climate crises in the near future; therefore, energy-efficient techniques for memory interfaces are also important. This paper presents contemporary approaches to improve I/O bandwidth, such as increasing the I/O pin count and data rate/pin, and to save energy in memory interfaces. However, there are still some design challenges that require further improvements. Therefore, various design challenges and problems to be solved are discussed, and future perspectives, including chiplet and die-to-die interfaces, are presented. Based on various research and development efforts to overcome the current limitations, the technological paradigm shift and related industries are expected to advance to the next level.",

    "abstract": "Many people have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused intense anxiety, fear, and complex feelings or emotions. Peopleâs emotions have changed and become more complicated since coronavirus vaccinations were introduced. Sentiment analysis of COVID-19 vaccination is critical for understanding public perception, vaccine hesitancy, monitoring vaccine impact, identifying adverse reactions, making policies, and allocating resources. Some artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems have been reported in the literature to analyze the sentiment of COVID-19 vaccination. However, most of them are end-to-end models that require explanation for their results in identifying COVID-19 vaccination sentiment. An explainable AI-based model can improve decision-making, transparency, and interpretability. It can enable users to comprehend how the model makes predictions and the factors that influence the outcome. Therefore, this study suggests a COVID-Twitter-BERT and LSTM (CT-BERT-LSTM) staking that is explicable for determining peopleâs views on the COVID-19 vaccination. The prediction of the proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model is then examined to determine where the suggested system successfully learned the context of the tweet and where it failed to do so. The proposed CT-BERT-LSTM model performed exceptionally well and outperformed the existing models with a F 1 -score of 0.88 in the sentiment identification of the COVID-19 vaccination.",

We showcase his pioneering breakthroughs in minimax optimization, p th norm formulations, yield optimization, and nonlinear circuit design optimization. We highlight advances in direct electromagnetic (EM) microwave optimization, circuit response sensitivities, and efficient S -parameters sensitivity calculations. We explore the port-tuning version of space mapping (SM) for EM-based analysis, techniques for industrial microwave design of satellite systems, and post-manufacture hardware tuning. The integration of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with SM for enhanced EM-based design optimization and yield prediction, cognition-driven microwave filter design, and parallels between SM and artificial intelligence (AI) is examined. Finally, we speculate on the future integration of cognitive science with engineering design, leveraging the synergy of AI, machine learning (ML), and SM.",

In CI, the AI model is partitioned between the edge device and the cloud, with intermediate features transmitted from the edge sub-model to the cloud sub-model to complete the inference task. However, reducing feature transmission overhead while maintaining task performance remains a challenge, particularly in the case of noisy wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based Semantic Communication (SC) model, SNN-SC, which extracts compact semantic information from features and transmits it through digital binary channels. Compared to the Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based SC model, whose output is floating-point, the binary output of SNN makes SNN-SC directly applicable to digital binary channels without the need for extra quantization. Moreover, we introduce a novel spiking neuron called IHF to enhance the reconstruction capability of the SNN-SC decoder. Finally, we enhance the performance of SNN-SC by maximizing the entropy of semantic information. SNN-SC achieves a higher compression ratio and overcomes the âcliff effectâ compared to the traditional separate source and channel coding method. In addition, SNN-SC has lower computational complexity than the DNN-based SC model and maintains higher task performance under poor channel conditions.",

    "abstract": "The development of affective computing and medical electronic technologies has led to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods for the early detection of depression. However, previous studies have often overlooked the necessity for the AI-assisted diagnosis system to be wearable and accessible in practical scenarios for depression recognition. In this work, we present an on-board executable multi-feature transfer-enhanced fusion model for our custom-designed wearable three-lead Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor, based on EEG data collected from 73 depressed patients and 108 healthy controls. Experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits low-computational complexity (65.0 K parameters), promising Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) performance (26.6 M), real-time processing (1.5 s/execution), and low power consumption (320.8 mW). Furthermore, it requires only 202.0 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and 279.6 KB of Read-Only Memory (ROM) when deployed on the EEG sensor. Despite its low computational and spatial complexity, the model achieves a notable classification accuracy of 95.2%, specificity of 96.9%, and sensitivity of 94.0% under independent test conditions. These results underscore the potential of deploying the model on the wearable three-lead EEG sensor for assisting in the diagnosis of depression.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable achievements in extensive fields while its black box nature limited applications in many critical areas. Against this drawback, explainable AI (XAI), has emerged as a focal point of current research. Recently, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) attract increasing attention in XAI because of their linguistic representation, which can be naturally understood by humans. However, the focus of these works is limited by simply relying on inherent rule-based structures for explanation. Motivated by further exploring the potential of FLS to overcome the challenges of XAI in terms of comprehensibility, scalability and transferability, in this work we propose Fuzzy Model-Agnostic Explanation (FMAE) as a post-hoc paradigm to explain the behavior of black box models. The innovations and contributions of this work provide a unified framework offering four levels of explanation, develop the associated algorithms to present the hidden knowledge behind the black box model in human-understandable form at different levels of granularity and create the interface to deliver explanations to users. First, we introduce the hierarchical FMAE framework to formulate explanations into four levels including sample, local, domain and universe. Second, the learning and explaining algorithms are developed to systematically construct FLS to model the behavior of black box models in the four levels where downscaling is performed by simplification to facilitate explanations with concise rules and upscaling is performed by aggregation to integrate explanations at a higher level. Third, the proposed explanation interface unifies two typical forms of expression in XAI by fuzzy rules: the semantic inference explanation revealing the decision mechanism of the black box model and the feature salience explanation reflecting the attribution and interaction of input features. Simulated user experiments are designed on the comprehensive explanatory metrics. Compared wi...",

    "abstract": "Peristaltic pumps are widely used in many industrial applications, especially in medical devices. Their reliability depends on proper maintenance, which includes the total replacement of tubes regularly due to the aging of the materials. The proper use of predictive maintenance techniques could potentially improve the efficiency of maintenance interventions and prevent failures by having a way to determine when the tube has passed its replacement time. We recorded a dataset using six different sensors (three accelerometers, one gyroscope, one magnetometer, and one microphone) using several cassettes (three new units and three units with expired life span). The recording was done at the highest possible frequency (100â6667 Hz, different for each sensor) and then downsampled several times to obtain frequencies as low as 12 Hz. This dataset is now publicly available. We trained 939 different models, which were the result of combining all different sensors as inputs but the microphone, and four basic architectures of recurrent neural network: One or two layers of either gated recurrent unit or long short-term memory with different number of nodes per layer (from 2 to 64). Among all trained models, we selected the ten best performing networks in terms of both accuracy and complexity. All of them reached an F1 score of 0.99 or 1 with holdout cross-validation. Those models were deployed on four different edge AI devices. For all combinations of model and edge AI devices we obtained metrics of memory size (from 0.3% to 160.6% RAM, and from 0.9% to 21.3% flash), inference time (from 0.39 to 1463.91 ms), and average consumption (from 0.15 to 5.30 mA). Nine out of ten models were proven viable for deployment. We concluded that the four models based on magnetometer data were significantly better in terms of consumption and inference time. To the best of our knowledge, the use of magnetometer data is a very uncommon approach to failure detection in predictive maintenance applica...",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare are driving research into solutions that can provide personalized guidance. For these solutions to be used as clinical decision support tools, the results provided must be interpretable and consistent with medical knowledge. To this end, this study explores the use of explainable AI to characterize the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A dataset of 9613 records from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was classified into three categories of cardiovascular risk (low, moderate, and high), as estimated by the Framingham Risk Score. Counterfactual explanations were generated with two different methods, MUlti Counterfactuals via Halton sampling (MUCH) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanation (DiCE). An error control mechanism is introduced in the preliminary classification phase to reduce classification errors and obtain meaningful and representative explanations. Furthermore, the concept of counterfactual conformity is introduced as a new way to validate single counterfactual explanations in terms of their conformity, based on proximity with respect to the factual observation and plausibility. The results indicate that explanations generated with MUCH are generally more plausible (lower implausibility) and more distinguishable (higher discriminative power) from the original class than those generated with DiCE, whereas DiCE shows better availability, proximity and sparsity. Furthermore, filtering the counterfactual explanations by eliminating the non-conformal ones results in an additional improvement in quality. The results of this study suggest that combining counterfactual explanations generation with conformity evaluation is worth further validation and expert assessment to enable future development of support tools that provide personalized recommendations for reducing individual risk by targeting specific...",

    "abstract": "The development of ultralow-power analog front ends for edge artificial intelligence (AI) is actively pursued; however, these front ends suffer from low-frequency selection accuracy, leading to increased training loads for the AI components and higher testing costs. In this article, we propose a novel circuit that fundamentally addresses these issues through direct conversion. By re-evaluating the circuit configurations of the multiplier, harmonic removal filter, and full-wave rectifier (FWR) from scratch, we have miniaturized and integrated an ultralow-power converter that transforms frequency components into pulse sequences. The frequency to be analyzed is determined by the local frequency input to the multiplier, which can be digitally controlled with high precision. In our system, the $Q$ value is adaptively adjusted by the local frequency of the direct conversion, allowing the same circuit configuration to be applied to all frequency nodes, eliminating the need for filter design for each node and providing a highly design-friendly and scalable frequency analysis system.The test chip was fabricated with a 0.18- $\\mu$ m process, operating at a 1.2-V supply, and outputting power pulse streams corresponding to 11 different frequencies ranging from 500 to 5 kHz. The total operating power was 0.9 $\\mu$ W, with an achieved equivalent $Q$ factor ranging from 3.6 to 36. In a training experiment using a convolutional neural network (CNN) speech recognition model constructed with a functional model equivalent to this front end, a recognition rate exceeding 80% was achieved, demonstrating the practicality of this front end.",

    "abstract": "With the rising demand for intelligent services and privacy protection in consumer artificial intelligence (AI), federated edge learning has emerged as a beacon for privacy-preserving distributed machine learning. This non-centralized approach offers distinct data privacy advantages, making it especially suitable for applications with strict privacy policies, such as consumer-centric healthcare systems. However, consumer electronics/devices in federated edge learning might unlawfully violate model ownership by duplicating or distributing models. Another concern is that a central server, if compromised, can become a conduit for model leakage, whether for profit motives or due to external intrusions, thus exacerbating the model ownership violation. To our knowledge, few works have focused on model ownership protection for federated edge learning in the consumer-centric healthcare domain. In this paper, we introduce a federated model ownership protection (FedMOP) approach. FedMOP is a model ownership safeguard and a formidable fortress built upon two core innovations. First, FedMOP can swiftly embed and replace watermarks during local training, allowing for the accurate identification and subsequent flagging of deceitful consumer devices. Second, FedMOP ensures that the server only accesses encrypted versions of the federated model, keeping the model a secret. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of FedMOP. We hope that FedMOP can light the way for surmounting similar ethical challenges in the broader realm of consumer-edge AI.",

    "abstract": "The power grids are becoming smarter with adoption of various IoT Technologies (Internet of Things). IoT calls for sensors, which are transacting real time data through communication channels, installed at various locations in power system. These communication channels not only become overloaded by high volume of state-estimation data from these sensors but are also prone to cyber-attacks. The cyber-attack may infirmly affect the load frequency control (LFC) schemes which are implemented across multi-area grids using state estimation techniques. The cyber-attack may modify system frequency via signal false data injections in system and therefore deteriorates system performance or may even lead to blackout. In this work, artificial intelligent (AI) estimator and nonlinear sliding mode controller (SMC) are combined together to form event-triggered intelligent control scheme which not only optimise the use of communication infrastructure but also attenuates cyber intrusions. The AI observer predicts grid states and also senses cyber intrusions via the back propagation error algorithm in presence of cyber-attacks. The proposed event-triggered SMC rejects the undesirable impact of cyber intrusions on the plant trajectories. The proposed event-triggered control strategy when subjected to cyber attack and power penetration from the distributed renewable resources is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations.",

    "abstract": "Indoor mobile robotics (IMR) has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in various domains, such as healthcare, logistics, and domestic assistance. However, navigating through indoor environments and performing safe manipulations still pose intractable challenges in terms of navigation accuracy and obstacle avoidance. To solve these issues, this paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) embodied multimodal perception framework for IMR intelligent navigation and safe manipulation. To ensure the navigation accuracy and robustness, we employ the complementary forward RGB camera, downward QR vision sensor, and wheel encoder measurements in a unified framework. The visual residuals and wheel odometry residuals are jointly minimized to estimate the robot states. To guarantee the safety of robotic manipulation tasks, we have developed an AI model that integrates transformer network with convolutional neural network, to associate the long-range RGB & depth patches and aggregate the multi-scale obstacle features, enabling the precise detection and segmentation of obstacles in RGB-D images. Afterwards, the depths of detected obstacles are regressed, providing the robot with crucial information for collision avoidance. Eventually, we design a refined robot manipulation system that dynamically adjusts the robot behavior to ensure effective collision avoidance and to minimize potential damage to its mechanical components by constantly evaluating the spatial relationships between the robot and its surroundings. By incorporating advanced obstacle detection and the avoidance mechanism, mobile robots can navigate reliably in indoor environments with a reduced risk of collisions and real-time decision making. The presented method has been evaluated on the developed IMR platform. On the collected dataset, the estimated IMR absolute position and orientation errors are less than 0.18m and 5Â° respectively. Besides, it achieves 89% mAP on obstacle detection....",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, though having achieved great success in many different fields over the past years, are usually data-hungry, fail to perform well on unseen samples, and lack interpretability. Different kinds of prior knowledge often exists in the target domain, and their use can alleviate the deficiencies with deep learning. To better mimic the behavior of human brains, different advanced methods have been proposed to identify domain knowledge and integrate it into deep models for data-efficient, generalizable, and interpretable deep learning, which we refer to as knowledge-augmented deep learning (KADL). In this survey, we define the concept of KADL and introduce its three major tasks, i.e., knowledge identification, knowledge representation, and knowledge integration. Different from existing surveys that are focused on a specific type of knowledge, we provide a broad and complete taxonomy of domain knowledge and its representations. Based on our taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, different from existing works that survey integration approaches agnostic to the taxonomy of knowledge. This survey subsumes existing works and offers a birdâs-eye view of research in the general area of KADL. The thorough and critical reviews of numerous papers help not only understand current progress but also identify future directions for the research on KADL.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss around the world. To help diagnose it, numerous cutting-edge works have built powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically grade DR via retinal fundus images (RFIs). However, RFIs are commonly affected by camera exposure issues that may lead to incorrect grades. The mis-graded results can potentially pose high risks to an aggravation of the condition. In this paper, we study this problem from the viewpoint of adversarial attacks. We identify and introduce a novel solution to an entirely new task, termed as adversarial exposure attack , which is able to produce natural exposure images and mislead the state-of-the-art DNNs. We validate our proposed method on a real-world public DR dataset with three DNNs, e.g. , ResNet50, MobileNet, and EfficientNet, demonstrating that our method achieves high image quality and success rate in transferring the attacks. Our method reveals the potential threats to DNN-based automatic DR grading and would benefit the development of exposure-robust DR grading methods in the future.",

    "abstract": "Our brains extract durable, generalizable knowledge from transient experiences of the world. Artificial neural networks come nowhere close to this ability. When tasked with learning to classify objects by training on nonrepeating video frames in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from shuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new stimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, compositional replay using memory blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature maps reconstructed by combining generic parts. CRUMB concatenates trainable and reusable memory block vectors to compositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Storing the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new stimuli enables memories of the stimuli to be replayed during later tasks. This reconstruction mechanism also primes the neural network to minimize catastrophic forgetting by biasing it toward attending to information about object shapes more than information about image textures and stabilizes the network during stream learning by providing a shared feature-level basis for all training examples. These properties allow CRUMB to outperform an otherwise identical algorithm that stores and replays raw images while occupying only 3.6% as much memory. We stress-tested CRUMB alongside 13 competing methods on seven challenging datasets. To address the limited number of existing online stream learning datasets, we introduce two new benchmarks by adapting existing datasets for stream learning. With only 3.7%â4.1% as much memory and 15%â43% as much runtime, CRUMB mitigates catastrophic forgetting more effectively than the state-of-the-art.

Improving the performance of depth estimation networks without increasing computational cost is highly advantageous for autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose to enhance depth estimation by improving the pose network in a self-supervised framework. Unlike conventional pose networks, our approach preserves more detailed spatial information by integrating multi-scale features and normalized coordinates. This improved spatial awareness allows for more accurate depth predictions. Comprehensive evaluations on the KITTI and Make3D datasets show that our method yields a 2-7% improvement in the absolute relative error (abs_rel) metric. Furthermore, on the KITTI odometry dataset, our approach demonstrates competitive performance, with relative translational error ( $ t_{rel}$ ) of $ 6.11$ and $ 7.21$ , and relative rotational error ( $ r_{rel}$ ) of $ 1.12$ and $ 2.05$ for sequences 9 and 10, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to the agile three-dimensional (3D) mobility and flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great promise for on-demand communications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In UAV communication systems, 3D beamforming is an effective technique for performance enhancement. To take full advantage of 3D beamforming in UAV communication systems, we need to accurately characterize and efficiently predict highly dynamic UAV channels in the beam domain. This paper first proposes a novel beam domain channel model (BDCM) considering random UAV trajectories and fuselage vibrations. Then, we propose a beam domain channel tracking algorithm to capture variations of multipath component (MPC) parameters in UAV channels. Finally, we put forward a novel beam domain channel prediction scheme for UAV communication systems utilizing channel sparsity and high temporal correlation in the beam domain. The proposed channel prediction scheme can extract channel variation trends utilizing the echo state network (ESN) and predict channel parameters in subsequent time blocks based on the history channel information. Simulation results show that the proposed channel prediction scheme outperforms the conventional prediction scheme based on angular speed estimation in terms of both prediction accuracy and communication system performance.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic imaging is an emerging technique that imitates the human retina to sense variations in dynamic scenes. It responds to pixel-level brightness changes by asynchronous streaming events and boasts microsecond temporal precision over a high dynamic range, yielding blur-free recordings under extreme illumination. Nevertheless, this modality falls short in spatial resolution and leads to a low level of visual richness and clarity. Pursuing hardware upgrades is expensive and might cause compromised performance due to more burdens on computational requirements. Another option is to harness offline, plug-in-play super-resolution solutions. However, existing ones, which demand substantial sample volumes for lengthy training on massive computing resources, are largely restricted by real data availability owing to the current imperfect high-resolution devices, as well as the randomness and variability of motion. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the first self-supervised neuromorphic super-resolution prototype. It can be self-adaptive to per input source from any low-resolution camera to estimate an optimal, high-resolution counterpart of any scale, without the need of side knowledge and prior training. Evaluated on downstream tasks, such a simple yet effective method can obtain competitive results against the state-of-the-arts, significantly promoting flexibility but not sacrificing accuracy. It also delivers enhancements for inferior natural images and optical micrographs acquired under non-ideal imaging conditions, breaking through the limitations that are challenging to overcome with frame-based techniques. In the current landscape where the use of high-resolution cameras for event-based sensing remains an open debate, our solution is a cost-efficient and practical alternative, paving the way for more intelligent imaging systems.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the pharmacological activity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties of molecules is a central task in drug discovery. Existing machine learning methods are transferred from one resource rich molecular property to another data scarce property in the same scaffold dataset. However, existing models may produce fragile and highly uncertain predictions for new scaffold molecules. And these models were tested on different benchmarks, which seriously affected the quality of their evaluation results. In this article, we introduce Meta-MolNet, a collection of data benchmark and algorithms, which is a standard benchmark platform for measuring model generalization and uncertainty quantification capabilities. Meta-MolNet manages a wide range of molecular datasets with high ratio of molecules/scaffolds, which often leads to more difficult data shift and generalization problems. Furthermore, we propose a graph attention network based on cross-domain meta-learning, Meta-GAT, which uses bilevel optimization to learn meta-knowledge from the scaffold family molecular dataset in the source domain. Meta-GAT benefits from meta-knowledge that reduces the requirement of sample complexity to enable reliable predictions of new scaffold molecules in the target domain through internal iteration of a few examples. We evaluate existing methods as baselines for the community, and the Meta-MolNet benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of measuring the proposed algorithm in domain generalization and uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Meta-GAT model has state-of-the-art domain generalization performance and robustly estimates uncertainty under few examples constraints. By publishing AI-ready data, evaluation frameworks, and baseline results, we hope to see the Meta-MolNet suite become a comprehensive resource for the AI-assisted drug discovery community.

    "abstract": "Recently, the concept of zero-touch networks (ZTNs) relying heavily on pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the full automation of future networks have emerged. ZTNs, empowered by AI, will play a significant role in reducing the management complexity of beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks. One enabling technology of ZTNs is network slicing (NS), which is the cornerstone of B5G networks. However, NS faces challenges, particularly in terms of radio resource allocation management. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient self-optimization scheme for a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system across different slices; named PABSO-DRL. This scheme dynamically and jointly manages power allocation and beam direction based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) and the time-varying dynamics of the NS environment. PABSO-DRL ensures high data rates for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) while guaranteeing high reliability for ultra-reliable low latency communications (uRLLC). The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved by designing multiple deep Q-learning (DQL) agents. The proposed scheme is extensively evaluated under two scenarios: perfect and imperfect CSI, comparing its performance with four traditional benchmark algorithms, and state-of-the-art schemes. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DRL scheme, even under imperfect CSI, highlighting its adaptability to various network slicing conditions.",

    "abstract": "The metaverse, which integrates physical and virtual realities through technologies such as high-speed internet, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence (AI), offers transformative prospects across various fields, particularly healthcare. This integration introduces a new paradigm in AI-driven medical imaging, particularly in assessing brain age'a crucial marker for detecting age-related neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite advances in deep learning for estimating brain age from structural MRI (sMRI), incorporating functional MRI (fMRI) data presents significant challenges due to its complex data structure and the noisy nature of functional connectivity measurements. To address these challenges, we present the Multitask Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (M-AVAE), a bespoke deep learning framework designed to enhance brain age predictions through multimodal MRI data integration. The M-AVAE uniquely separates latent variables into generic and unique codes, effectively isolating shared and modality-specific features. Additionally, integrating multitask learning with sex classification as a supplementary task enables the model to account for sex-specific aging nuances. Evaluated on the OpenBHB dataset'a comprehensive multisite brain MRI aggregation-the M-AVAE demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.77 years, surpassing conventional methodologies. This success positions M-AVAE as a powerful tool for metaverse-based healthcare applications in brain age estimation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding applications of deep learning, particularly in image segmentation and recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have been remarkable. With climate change posing increasing threats to road safety through hazards such as potholes, water puddles, and cracks, accurately detecting and segmenting these dangers has become crucial for protecting road users. Detecting and segmenting water puddles is particularly challenging due to their varying sizes and shapes. This paper proposes a novel Dense Connection U-Net (DCU-Net) architecture specifically designed to improve the detection accuracy of water puddles. We modify and combine elements of DenseNet-121 and U-Net for model training, with DenseNet-121 handling encoding tasks and U-Net managing decoding tasks. A bridging layer is employed to enhance feature transmission between the encoder and decoder stages, effectively recovering more image details. We compared the performance of DCU-Net with Deeplabv3+, U-Net, PSPNet, and ResU-Net on segmentation tasks using our dataset. DCU-Net achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 82%, along with the best accuracy and F1 Score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of DCU-Net in detecting water puddles in diverse environments, providing a new architecture for future research in related fields.",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a vital role in various applications, enabling machines to decode and analyze emotions conveyed through speech. This study introduces a novel approach, Dynamic Gender-Aware Enhanced Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (DGA-EBPSO), that leverages a gender-specific particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique for feature selection to enhance SER accuracy while promoting interpretability. We extract pitch and acoustic-related statistical features from speech samples and develop separate models for gender prediction and emotion detection. The gender-specific DGA-EBPSO algorithm incorporates a hybrid mutation strategy to improve feature selection efficiency and considers gender-based variations in emotional expression. Notably, our approach prioritizes interpretability by allowing for analysis of the features most influential for gender and emotion classification using the DGA-EBPSO framework. This focus on interpretability aligns with the principles of responsible AI development, ensuring transparency and mitigating potential biases in SER systems. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by achieving superior classification performance (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) on benchmark emotional speech datasets like CREMA-D, EmergencyCalls, IEMOCAP, and RAVDESS.",

    "abstract": "Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) refers to an agent navigating to an object in an unseen environment, which is an ability often required in the accomplishment of complex tasks. Though it has drawn increasing attention from researchers in the Embodied AI community, there has not been a contemporary and comprehensive survey of ObjectNav. In this survey, we give an overview of this field by summarizing more than 70 recent papers. First, we give the preliminaries of the ObjectNav: the definition, the simulator, and the metrics. Then, we group the existing works into three categories: 1) end-to-end methods that directly map the observations to actions, 2) modular methods that consist of a mapping module, a policy module, and a path planning module, and 3) zero-shot methods that use zero-shot learning to do navigation. Finally, we summarize the performance of existing works and the main failure modes and discuss the challenges of ObjectNav. This survey would provide comprehensive information for researchers in this field to have a better understanding of ObjectNav. Note to Practitioners âThis work was motivated by the increased interest in real-world applications of mobile robots. Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav), which is an important task in these applications, requires an agent to find an object in an unseen environment. To accomplish that, the agent needs to be equipped with the capability to move in the environment, decide where to go, and recognize the object categories. So far, most works on ObjectNav have been done in a simulation environment. We present an overview of the existing works in ObjectNav and introduce them in three categories. Additionally, we analyze the current performance of ObjectNav and the challenges for future research. This paper provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the developed methods in ObjectNav, which can help them to have a good understanding of this task and develop suitable solutions for applica...",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal medical image fusion maximizes the complementary information from diverse modality images by integrating source images. The fused medical image could offer enhanced richness and improved accuracy compared to the source images. Unfortunately, the existing deep learning-based medical image fusion methods generally rely on convolutional operations, which may not effectively capture global information such as spatial relationships or shape features within and across image modalities. To address this problem, we propose a unified AI-Generated Content (AIGC)-based medical image fusion, termed Cross-Modal Interactive Network (CMINet). The CMINet integrates a recursive transformer with an interactive Convolutional Neural Network. Specifically, the recursive transformer is designed to capture extended spatial and temporal dependencies within modalities, while the interactive CNN aims to extract and merge local features across modalities. Benefiting from cross-modality interaction learning, the proposed method can generate fused images with rich structural and functional information. Additionally, the architecture of the recursive network is structured to reduce parameter count, which could be beneficial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive experiments on multi-model medical images (MRI and CT, MRI and PET, and MRI and SPECT) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion methods subjectively and objectively.",

    "abstract": "Task and motion planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks. Optimization-based TAMP focuses on hybrid optimization approaches that define goal conditions via objective functions and are capable of handling open-ended goals, robotic dynamics, and physical interaction between the robot and the environment. Therefore, optimization-based TAMP is particularly suited to solve highly complex, contact-rich locomotion and manipulation problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review on optimization-based TAMP, covering first, planning domain representations, including action description languages and temporal logic, second, individual solution strategies for components of TAMP, including AI planning and trajectory optimization (TO), and finally, the dynamic interplay between logic-based task planning and model-based TO. A particular focus of this survey is to highlight the algorithm structures to efficiently solve TAMP, especially hierarchical and distributed approaches. In addition, the survey emphasizes the synergy between the classical methods and contemporary learning-based innovations, such as large language models. Furthermore, the future research directions for TAMP is discussed in this survey, highlighting both algorithmic and application-specific challenges.",

Meanwhile, enhancing dynamic network performance is a crucial element in promoting technological advancement and meeting the growing demands of users in many applications areas involving networks. In this article, we explore an integration of LLMs and graphs in dynamic networks, focusing on potential applications and a practical study. Specifically, we first review essential technologies and applications of LLM-enabled graphs, followed by an exploration of their advantages in dynamic networking. Subsequently, we introduce and analyze LLM-enabled graphs and their applications in dynamic networks from the perspective of LLMs in different roles. On this basis, we propose a novel framework of LLM-enabled graphs for networking optimization, and then present a case study on UAV networking, concentrating on optimizing UAV trajectory and communication resource allocation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline several potential future extensions.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) has already seen numerous successful applications, the upcoming challenge lies in how to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI). Self-learning algorithms can autonomously acquire knowledge and adapt to new, demanding applications, recognized as one of the most effective techniques to overcome this challenge. Although many related studies have been conducted, there is still no comprehensive and systematic review available, nor well-founded recommendations for the application of autonomous intelligent systems, especially autonomous driving. As a result, this article comprehensively analyzes and classifies self-learning algorithms into three categories: broad self-learning, narrow self-learning, and limited self-learning. These categories are used to describe the popular usage, the most promising techniques, and the current status of hybridization with self-supervised learning. Then, the narrow self-learning is divided into three parts based on the self-learning realization path: sample self-learning, model self-learning, and self-learning architecture. For each method, this article discusses in detail its self-learning capacity, challenges, and applications to autonomous driving. Finally, the future research directions of self-learning algorithms are pointed out. It is expected that this study has the potential to eventually contribute to revolutionizing autonomous driving technology.",

    "abstract": "Recently, computing in memory (CiM) has been proven to be an energy-efficient and promising architecture for artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. And yet, current CiM schemes generally suffer from limited throughput compared to their digital counterparts, and the key reason is that the CiM macro calculation must iterate through multiple cycles. Thus, the need to reduce the calculation cycle of the macro while keeping high energy efficiency and the necessity of developing acceleration methods for the universal CiM-based processor have become major issues faced by the current CiM architectures. To surmount these critical problems, we propose a processor based on a two-cycle CiM macro. Our work makes three main contributions: 1) we present a Radix16-based digital-CiM macro with look-up table (LUT) optimization to reduce dynamic power consumption; 2) we devise a hybrid Winograd microarchitecture and dataflow that supports (2, 3) and (4, 3) Winograd convolution, meaning that a good compromise can be reached between the accuracy of the algorithm and the reduction in workload; and 3) we propose a macrolevel parallel dual-side sparse CiM core that uses a horizontal direction compression method to reduce the input cycle of activation data and improve the mapping efficiency of the weight data in the macros. A prototype of the processor is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS, which achieves a peak system energy efficiency of 19.9â258.5-TOPS/W for a voltage supply of 0.6â1.1 V, and an operating frequency of 78â287 MHz, a 2.55â7.08\nÃ\nhigher than other state-of-the-art CiM processors.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has profoundly impacted todayâs world. Recent technological advancements in the Internet and Information Communication (ICT) have paved the way for revolutionary technologies, making life easier for humankind. IoT has found applications in almost every sector, enabling the connectivity of digital objects to the Internet. This technology has undergone significant advancements, leading to the emergence of a new paradigm called the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT). IoNT represents the latest evolution of IoT and has garnered attention from researchers and scientists. By combining nanotechnology with IoT, IoNT offers a more advanced paradigm than its generic counterpart, potentially reshaping the current IoT landscape. However, these limitless benefits come with challenges that persist in both IoT and the emerging IoNT ecosystem. Moreover, additional challenges need to be addressed due to the miniature nature and novelty of the IoNT ecosystem. The lack of research in the field of IoNT has motivated us to undertake this study. Our research aims to highlight the security and privacy challenges specific to IoNT and nano communication. Furthermore, we examine important architectures related to IoNT, nanoscale communication, real-life applications of IoNT, as well as simulators and testbeds useful for IoNT. We also address challenges associated with the incorporation of novel technologies, primarily Artificial Intelligence (AI), into IoNT. To achieve this, we provide a detailed review of existing works related to the IoNT ecosystem, emphasizing security and privacy concerns. Additionally, we explore the opportunities and future directions for IoNT, serving as a reference for further research.",

    "abstract": "The reduction of vibration and noise in active magnetic bearings (AMBs) within electric motors has garnered increasing attention. However, there has been limited research on the high-frequency (HF) vibration introduced by AMB controllers in relation to the switching frequency. In this article, we pioneer an exploration into the mechanism and characteristics of HF vibration in magnetic bearings. We introduce a carrier phase-shifting (CPS) method to analyze its impact on the spatial distribution of electromagnetic force in the air gap and vibration response. Subsequently, we construct a deep neural network (DNN) to model and predict the actual vibration of magnetic bearings, and integrate the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize the CPS mode, phase-shifting angles, and switching frequency. Finally, experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of our proposed CPS method and artificial intelligence (AI) optimization algorithm. Our results demonstrate a remarkable reduction in HF vibration of AMB, achieving a maximum reduction of 90% and an average of 84% through intelligent optimization.",

    "abstract": "Including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in embedded systems at the edge allows applications to exploit Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities directly within devices operating at the network periphery, facilitating real-time decision-making. Especially critical in domains such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and healthcare, the use of ANNs can enable these systems to process substantial data volumes locally, thereby reducing latency and power consumption. Moreover, it enhances privacy and security by containing sensitive data within the confines of the edge device. The adoption of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in these environments offers a promising computing paradigm, mimicking the behavior of biological neurons and efficiently handling dynamic, time-sensitive data. However, deploying efficient SNNs in resource-constrained edge environments requires hardware accelerators, such as solutions based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), that provide high parallelism and reconfigurability. This paper introduces Spiker+, a comprehensive framework for generating efficient, low-power, and low-area customized SNNs accelerators on FPGAs for inference at the edge. Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN architecture, a library of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python code. Spiker+ is tested on three benchmark datasets, the MNIST, the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD) and the AudioMNIST. On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs (BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGAs, and power consumption, draining only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780Î¼s/img. To th...",

It greatly improves the accuracy and usefulness of diagnostic processes. This paper introduces a novel MRI analysis approach through the lens of AIGC, leveraging physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) models. This integration pioneers a new paradigm in consumer healthcare diagnostics and embeds physics principles into deep learning (DL) models, thus improving interpretability and adherence to physical constraints. Additionally, this method improves the visibility of the healthcare community by integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). This approach demonstrates a reasonable precision rate of 96% when applied to brain tumor MRI images.

    "abstract": "The parallel advancement of AI and IoT technologies has recently boosted the development of multi-modal computing ( M2C ) on pervasive autonomous embedded systems (AES). M2C takes advantage of data from different modalities such as images, audio, and text and is able to achieve notable improvements in accuracy. However, achieving these accuracy gains often comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and energy consumption. Furthermore, the presence of numerous advanced sensors in these systems significantly contributes to power consumption, exacerbating the issue of limited power resources. Collectively, these challenges pose difficulties in deploying M2C on small embedded devices with scarce energy resources. In this article, we propose an A daptive M odality Gating technique called AMG for in-situ M2C applications. The primary objective of AMG is to conserve energy while preserving the accuracy advantages of M2C . To achieve this goal, AMG incorporates two first-of-its-kind designs. Firstly, it introduces a novel semi-gating architecture that enables partial modality sensor power gating. Secondly, it facilitates a self-initialization/tuning process on the AES. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG . It significantly improves the lifespan of AES by 74.5% to 133.7% within the same energy budget, while satisfying all performance and latency requirements across various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Currently, 6G lies at the forefront of wireless communications research. It has many additional features compared to those of previous generations. In particular, new key performance indicators (KPIs) are defined, such as latency at the microsecond level and transmission of a higher amount of data, among others. Ensuring these KPIs will undoubtedly boost the development of immersive applications, such as the metaverse, digital twin and others related to Industry 6.0. For this purpose, technologies like edge computing, THz communications and cell-free systems need to be exploited. To further optimize these technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) are expected to play a pivotal role. Another important aspect is the increased security and privacy in both the infrastructure and the communications between the system and the underlying users. To support these, the current research suggests the networkâs architecture to be more user-centric, meaning it should be tailored to each userâs requirements rather than be service-oriented, as was the case with 5G. Therefore, the main goal of this survey article is to review the various aspects of the 6G network architecture from a user-centric standpoint.",

    "abstract": "High-quality private machine learning (ML) data stored in local data centers becomes a key competitive factor for AI corporations. In this paper, we present a novel insider attack called Matryoshka to reveal the possibility of breaking the privacy of ML data even with no exposed interface. Our attack employs a scheduled-to-publish DNN model as a carrier model for covert transmission of secret models which memorize the information of private ML data that otherwise has no interface to the outsider. At the core of our attack, we present a novel parameter sharing approach which exploits the learning capacity of the carrier model for information hiding. Our approach simultaneously achieves: (i) High Capacity â With almost no utility loss of the carrier model, Matryoshka can transmit over 10,000 real-world data samples within a carrier model which has $220\times$ less parameters than the total size of the stolen data, and simultaneously transmit multiple heterogeneous datasets or models within a single carrier model under a trivial distortion rate, neither of which can be done with existing steganography techniques; (ii) Decoding Efficiency â once downloading the published carrier model, an outside colluder can exclusively decode the hidden models from the carrier model with only several integer secrets and the knowledge of the hidden model architecture; (iii) Effectiveness â Moreover, almost all the recovered models either have similar performance as if it is trained independently on the private data, or can be further used to extract memorized raw training data with low error; (iv) Robustness â Information redundancy is naturally implemented to achieve resilience against common post-processing techniques on the carrier before its publishing; (v) Covertness â A model inspector with different levels of prior knowledge could hardly differentiate a carrier model from a normal model.",

    "abstract": "In automated radio network control, understanding the effect of different factors on network performance is crucial. Although there are machine learning (ML) solutions that can reliably anticipate network performance expressed as key performance indicator (KPI) values, these models are typically black-box or provide only partial explanations. Most approaches are based on flat data structures and cannot exploit the graph nature of the data, being unable to quantify neighborsâ impact. In this paper, we propose a new graph neural network-based model called Ensemble Graph Attention Network (Ensemble GAT) for network KPI prediction. We show that the proposed model results in better or comparable KPI prediction performance to the state-of-the-art while also carrying information about links between neighboring cells. In addition to model creation, we investigate how explainable AI solutions can be used to provide root-cause explanations for network KPI degradation. To generate feature attributions, we introduce an adapted version of GraphLime that works with ensemble models. In addition, we propose a new technique called Neighbor Perturbation to identify the neighboring cells that have the most significant impact on KPI prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "During operation, due to an unforeseen circumstance, an in-service transformer could experience some faults, which could be of electrical or thermal origin. Transformers diagnostic and monitoring through Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is an imperative way for sustainable and reliable power distribution. This method is used in the early detection of faults in liquid filled power systems. In this contribution, a novel approach integrating uncertainty into DGA for power transformers is proposed. By modifying traditional empirical methods like the Duvalâs Triangle and Duvalâs Pentagon to include uncertainty, this study demonstrates how these modifications affect fault diagnostics. The results indicate that incorporating gas chromatographâs uncertainty enhances diagnostic accuracy for IEC, Rogers, and Doernenburg methods, improving effective fault detection. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) models such as Random Forest, MLP, and SVM, trained with probabilities derived from the modified methods, show significant improvements in diagnostic performance. These models demonstrated increased robustness against different levels of uncertainty, achieving 87.76% accuracy for the Random Forest model and 86.73% for the SVM model with a 30% uncertainty level on the IEC TC10 Database. Therefore, the incorporation of the Gas chromatographâs uncertainty in DGA diagnostic methods appear to be a promising approach to support transformer monitoring and fault diagnostic both for transformer owners and the producer.",

    "abstract": "The security guarantee of AI-enabled software systems (particularly using deep learning techniques as a functional core) is pivotal against the adversarial attacks exploiting software vulnerabilities. However, little attention has been paid to a systematic investigation of vulnerabilities in such systems. A common situation learned from the open source software community is that deep learning engineers frequently integrate off-the-shelf or open-source learning frameworks into their ecosystems. In this work, we specifically look into deep learning (DL) framework and perform the first  systematic study of vulnerabilities in DL systems through a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and open-source DL tools, including TensorFlow, Caffe, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch. We propose a two-stream data analysis framework to explore vulnerability patterns from various databases. We investigate the unique DL frameworks and libraries development ecosystems that appear to be decentralized and fragmented. By revisiting the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) List, which provides the traditional software vulnerability related practices, we observed that it is more challenging to detect and fix the vulnerabilities throughout the DL systems lifecycle. Moreover, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of  DL vulnerabilities to better understand the patterns of vulnerability and the challenges in fixing them. We have released the full replication package at https://github.com/codelzz/Vulnerabilities4DLSystem . We anticipate that our study can advance the development of secure DL systems.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used in real-world decision-making systems, raising concerns about potential biases and unfairness. Existing in-processing bias mitigation approaches often focus on achieving numerical parity across demographic groups while neglecting the performance impact on individual groups and the overall performance-fairness trade-off. This can lead to increased discriminatory outcomes and hinder efforts to develop truly fair AI systems. This paper proposes Transfer Learning with Fairness Optimization (TLFO), a novel framework that serially optimizes predictive performance and fairness in machine learning models. TLFO leverages transfer learning by dividing the training process into two distinct phases: (1) initial learning for performance optimization and (2) subsequent finetuning for fairness enhancement. This sequential approach enables fine-grained control over fairness constraints, minimizing the performance-fairness trade-off. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate TLFOâs effectiveness. TLFO consistently achieves superior fairness with minimal performance degradation compared to state-of-the-art in-processing bias mitigation approaches, highlighting its potential for generating fair and accurate classifiers with versatile applications.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the critical need for effective rehabilitation monitoring for individuals with gait issues through the integration of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) models. The study meticulously details the methodology, emphasizing the systematic data collection process, participant categorization based on gait severity, and the deployment of a novel physical activity monitoring device. Through the lens of the Berg Balance Test, the analysis scrutinizes functional mobility and balance across seven rehabilitation activities. Data augmentation techniques and data pre-processing methods are employed, and the proposed hybrid model combines both time and frequency-domain data using a multibranch CNN-BiLSTM architecture embedded with a dual-stage attention mechanism. The study compares our approach with machine learning and deep learning models, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed interpretable architecture. Interpretability is highlighted through attention mechanisms, revealing the modelâs prioritization of FFT-transformed data and its ability to identify influential branches. Our model provides transparent insights to healthcare professionals for personalized rehabilitation strategies. These results show high potential in developing real-time applications, including the integration of additional sensor modalities, interdisciplinary collaborations, and the expansion of demographic inclusivity for more robust and applicable rehabilitation monitoring solutions.",

    "abstract": "Consumer electronics are becoming increasingly popular in our daily life. Enabled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) of Things (AIoT), consumer electronics can autonomously analyze user data and learn user preferences. AIoT has empowered various personal consumer applications, such as healthcare and recommendation, in which user sentiment analysis is necessary. This paper studies sentiment analysis by analyzing user data generated from consumer electronics, especially image data. Considering that the images generated by consumer electronics generally have blended emotions, we apply the Label Enhancement (LE) technologies to enhance the emotion labels into fine-grained emotion distributions. To match the need of real-world AIoT scenarios, we put forward in this paper the first trustworthy LE algorithm, called LE-Weighted k-Nearest Neighbors (LE-WkNN). Theoretical analysis shows that the enhanced emotion distributions by LE-WkNN are guaranteed to approach the ground-truth ones, which has strong theory guidance. Second, we train a convolution neural network to learn the enhanced emotion distributions. Finally, we conduct experiments on three large-scale emotion datasets. The experimental results validate that LE-WkNN accurately enhances the emotion distributions and our model achieves the best performance for sentiment analysis. Overall, LE-WkNN is trustworthy and has great potential for consumer electronics applications.",

    "abstract": "Accurately diagnosing chronic kidney disease requires pathologists to assess the structure of multiple tissues under different stains, a process that is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. Current AI-based methods for automatic structure assessment, like segmentation, often demand extensive manual annotation and focus on single stain domain. To address these challenges, we introduce MSMTSeg, a generative self-supervised meta-learning framework for multi-stained multi-tissue segmentation in renal biopsy whole slide images (WSIs). MSMTSeg incorporates multiple stain transform models for style translation of inter-stain domains, a self-supervision module for obtaining pre-trained models with the domain-specific feature representation, and a meta-learning strategy that leverages generated virtual data and pre-trained models to learn the domain-invariant feature representation across multiple stains, thereby enhancing segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that MSMTSeg achieves superior and robust performance, with mDSC of 0.836 and mIoU of 0.718 for multiple tissues under different stains, using only one annotated training sample for each stain. Our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each component, positioning MSMTSeg ahead of classic advanced segmentation networks, recent few-shot segmentation methods, and unsupervised domain adaptation methods. In conclusion, our proposed few-shot cross-domain technology offers a feasible and cost-effective solution for multi-stained renal histology segmentation, providing convenient assistance to pathologists in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Localization of a robotic system within a previously mapped environment is important for reducing estimation drift and for reusing previously built maps. Existing techniques for geometry-based localization have focused on the description of local surface geometry, usually using pointclouds as the underlying representation. We propose a system for geometrybased localization that extracts features directly from an implicit surface representation: the Signed Distance Function (SDF). The SDF varies continuously through space, which allows the proposed system to extract and utilize features describing both surfaces and free-space. Through evaluations on public datasets, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, and show an increase in localization performance over state-of-the-art handcrafted surfaces-only descriptors. We achieve an average improvement of ~12% on an RGB-D dataset and ~18% on a LiDAR-based dataset. Finally, we demonstrate our system for localizing a LiDAR-equipped Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) within a previously built map of a search and rescue training ground. Our system, called freetures, is available as open source $^{1}$ .",

However, various bad weather degradations can create visibility problems that impair the performance of high-level tasks. Though image enhancement techniques have been extensively studied for safe self-driving in bad weather, few studies have dealt with both enhancement and perception simultaneously. To cope with bad weather conditions for high-level perception, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based framework, which connects the enhancement network with the perception network. To this end, we design a universal enhancement network that can address multiple bad weather conditions and assist in producing promising perception results.

    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) represent multi-view images as 3D scenes, achieving a photo-realistic novel view synthesis quality. However, capturing multi-view images in realworld scenarios is not well aligned and often results in blur or noise. Deblur-NeRF, which uses kernel deformation to improve sharpness, is effective but the quantity of training blur samples and imbalance significantly affect the overall results. In this study, we propose neural radiance fields deblurring with active learning (NeRF-DA), focusing on high-quality blurred images for 3D scene modeling. NeRF-DA uses pool-based active learning with uncertainty estimation to improve model efficiency with a high-quality training set. Subsequently, we deblur the data using the trained model and proceed with NeRF training by selecting the best-sharpened images for querying. Experiments on both camera motion blur and defocus blur demonstrate that NeRF-DA significantly enhances the quality of the existing Deblur-NeRF.",

The rapid growth and spread of social media websites provide an information-rich channel from which tourism researchers and managers can collect a large amount of text-based reviews or comments and photos relating to the past travel experiences of users. The travel photos with geographic information are especially helpful in identifying the geographical location of the destinations. By analyzing these big data in various formats can help to understand the interests of tourists at destinations. In this paper, a framework is proposed to identify the interests of tourists by integrating information carried by the geotagged photos shared on social media websites. Such an approach is expected to provide sustainable tracking on popular places of interest (POIs) updated by tourists and pick the best representative photos taken by them. The performance of this model is evaluated by conducting a case study using the geotagged photos taken in Hong Kong. A case study proved this proposed framework could make a thriving tourism in...",

    "abstract": "Variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) combine the best of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and variational inference and have been used to address various tasks such as node classification or link prediction. However, the lack of explainability is a limiting factor when trustworthy decisions are required. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc explainability framework for VGAEs that considers their encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we propose a layer-wise-relevance-propagation-based (LRP-based) explanation technique coined GF-LRP which, to our knowledge, is the first explanation method for VGAEs. GF-LRP goes beyond existing LRP techniques for GCNs by taking into account, in addition to input features and the graph structure of the data, the VGAE branch-specific architecture. The explanations are branch-specific in the sense that we explain the mean and standard deviation branches of the Gaussian distribution learned by the model. For a node's prediction, GF-LRP infers the most relevant features, nodes and its edges. To prove the effectiveness of our explanation method, we compute fidelity, sparsity and contrastivity as well as commonly employed evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and visualizations on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed explanation method.",

    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for processing the whole slide image with pyramid structure and giga-pixel size in digital pathology. However, existing attention-based MIL methods are primarily trained on the image modality and a pre-defined label set, leading to limited generalization and interpretability. Recently, vision language models (VLM) have achieved promising performance and transferability, offering potential solutions to the limitations of MIL-based methods. Pathological diagnosis is an intricate process that requires pathologists to examine the WSI step-by-step. In the field of natural language process, the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method is widely utilized to imitate the human reasoning process. Inspired by the CoT prompt and pathologistsâ clinic knowledge, we propose a chain-of-diagnosis prompting multiple instance learning (CoD-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, the chain-of-diagnosis text prompt decomposes the complex diagnostic process in WSI into progressive sub-processes from low to high magnification. Additionally, we propose a text-guided contrastive masking module to accurately localize the tumor region by masking the most discriminative instances and introducing the guidance of normal tissue texts in a contrastive way. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world subtyping datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CoD-MIL.",

    "abstract": "Semantic-and task-oriented communication has emerged as a promising approach to reducing the latency and bandwidth requirements of the next-generation mobile networks by transmitting only the most relevant information needed to complete a specific task at the receiver. This is particularly advantageous for machine-oriented communication of high-data-rate content, such as images and videos, where the goal is rapid and accurate inference, rather than perfect signal reconstruction. While semantic-and task-oriented compression can be implemented in conventional communication systems, joint sourceâchannel coding (JSCC) offers an alternative end-to-end approach by optimizing compression and channel coding together, or even directly mapping the source signal to the modulated waveform. Although all digital communication systems today rely on separation, thanks to its modularity, JSCC is known to achieve higher performance in finite blocklength scenarios and to avoid cliff and the leveling-off effects in time-varying channel scenarios. This article provides an overview of the information theoretic foundations of JSCC, surveys practical JSCC designs over the decades, and discusses the reasons for their limited adoption in practical systems. We then examine the recent resurgence of JSCC, driven by the integration of deep learning techniques, particularly through DeepJSCC, highlighting its many surprising advantages in various scenarios. Finally, we discuss why it may be time to reconsider todayâs strictly separate architectures and reintroduce JSCC to enable high-fidelity, low-latency communications in critical applications such as autonomous driving, drone surveillance, or wearable systems.",

    "abstract": "Embodied conversational agents that interact socially with people in the physical world require multi-modal capabilities, such as appropriately responding to visual features of users. While existing vision-and-language models can generate language based on visual input, this language is not situated in a social interaction in the physical world. We present a novel task called Visual Conversation Starters, where an agent generates a conversation-starting question referring to features visible in an image of the user. We collect a dataset of 4,000 images of people with 12,000 crowdsourced conversation starters, and compare various model architectures: fine-tuning smaller seq2seq or image-to-text models versus zero-shot prompting of GPT-3.5, using image captions versus end-to-end image input, and training on human data versus synthetic questions generated by GPT-3.5. Models were used to generate friendly conversation starters which were evaluated on criteria including language fluency, visual grounding, interestingness and politeness. Results show that GPT-3.5 generates more interesting and polite questions than smaller models that are fine-tuned on crowdsourced data, but vision-to-language models are better at referencing visual features, and they can mimick GPT-3.5's performance. This demonstrates the feasibility of deep visiolinguistic models for situated social agents, forming an important first stage in creating situated multimodal social interaction.",

    "abstract": "We study the optimal scheduling problem where $n$ source nodes attempt to transmit updates over $L$ shared wireless on/off fading channels to optimize their age performance under energy and age-violation tolerance constraints. Specifically, we provide a generic formulation of age-optimization in the form of a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and obtain the optimal scheduler as the solution of an associated Linear Programming problem. We investigate the characteristics of the optimal single-user multi-channel scheduler under different age-related objectives where a usual threshold-based policy does not apply. We then investigate the stability region of the optimal scheduler for the multi-user case under age-violation tolerance constraints. Furthermore, we develop two online schedulers that do not require statistics and are amenable to scalable operation: Drift-plus-penalty-based design, and a novel variation of the well-known Q-learning-based reinforcement learning method that combines Q-learning with drift-minimization-methods successfully for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our numerical studies compare the performance of our online schedulers to the optimal scheduler to reveal that both algorithms capture the essential behavior of the optimal design under different scenarios with good scalability, with the Q-learning-based design providing even closer performance to the optimal one by utilizing the history of the drift in a novel way.",

    "abstract": "Fundus diseases are prevalent causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, particularly in regions with limited access to ophthalmologists for timely diagnosis. Current approaches to fundus disease diagnosis heavily rely on expert-annotated data and AI-assisted image analysis, offering advantages such as improved accuracy and accessibility. However, the dependency on annotated data poses a significant challenge, especially in regions with limited resources. To address this challenge, we propose a label-free general framework based on self-supervised machine learning. We performed feature distillation on a large number of unlabeled fundus images and employed a linear classifier for the detection of different fundus diseases. In validation experiments on public and external validation fundus datasets, our model surpassed existing supervised approaches, achieving a remarkable increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of 15.7%, and even outperformed individual human experts. Our approach offers a promising solution to the limitations of current diagnostic methods, enhancing the potential for early and accurate detection of fundus diseases in resource-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Detecting small objects in remote sensing images poses significant challenges to the field of computer vision, primarily stemming from the complexity of backgrounds, limitations in pixel resolution, and information loss during the feature fusion process. While general object detection has significantly advanced in recent years, remote sensing small object detection remains an unsolved problem, with existing frameworks struggling to achieve high performance at small scales. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the boundary-aware feature fusion network (BAFNet), which significantly enhances the modelâs ability to represent and locate small objects precisely within complex remote sensing scenarios. First, a dual-stream attention fusion module captures complementary foreground and background cues through bidirectional context modelling. By jointly attending to objects and their surroundings, it enhances discriminative power for distinguishing small objects. Additionally, we incorporate a boundary-aware branch to better preserve crucial detailed information vital for small scale objects. This auxiliary component supervises the fusion of contextual semantics and spatial information, aiding in retaining critical boundary details that are prone to loss during cross-layer feature fusion. We conducted experiments on the challenging AI-TOD, VisDrone, DIOR, and LEVIR-Ship datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art object detection methods, particularly in terms of precisely identifying small objects within remote sensing images.

    "abstract": "The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground deployments in both communication and computing domains. In such networks, aerial platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities and finely tuned inference models trained on rich datasets, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated air-ground edge-cloud model framework, in which UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and small model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers providing large model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived based on the mAP of the edge model and mAP of the cloud model, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths a...",

    "abstract": "Both predictive uncertainty estimation and visual explanation are crucial elements in helping humans understand the artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making process and in building trustworthy AI. However, there has been comparatively limited investigation into the intersection of these two domains in multimodal scenarios. In this article, we propose a universal explanation framework to evaluate counterfactual samples of predictive uncertainty in multimodal models. Inspired by multimodal representation learning, our framework leverages a shared latent space of multimodal variational autoencoders (MVAEs) to generate counterfactual explanations (CEs) of predictive uncertainty, enabling us to identify the input features contributing to high predictive uncertainty. To further evaluate the quality of counterfactual samples, we propose a Bayesian local linear approximation (BLLA) method. This method models the overall linear space as an inverse chi-square distribution while representing feature importance and the error term as normal distributions. By doing so, it captures the uncertainty and feature importance of each modality. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments conducted on multimodal classification and regression tasks, we demonstrate that our framework successfully generates accurate CEs of predictive uncertainty, establishes the consistency of feature importance, and comprehensively facilitates usersâ comprehension of multimodal model behavior.",

    "abstract": "Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a kind of malicious attempts among many others that make target services unavailable to legitimate users by using a large number of bots, which send many service requests exceeding the processing capacity of the services. Detection of botnet traffic is therefore critical to maintaining the availability and quality of the services. In contrast, identifying the type of botnet attacks helps system administrators quickly determine which part of the computer and network system is under attack. Current works focus on rule-based detection, which sets rules in the network firewall to drop suspicious traffic that matches the rules. With the emergence of machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL), several preliminary works have been developed to learn botnet traffic behavior and perform detection. However, the performance of existing ML/DL models can be further improved and their decision/prediction are not transparent, making it hard for users to interpret and trust the results. In this work, we develop a novel deep learning model for botnet detection and classification combined with its ability of explaining the decision of the model. We first leverage latent representation of traffic features generated using convolutional neural networks to detect whether a traffic record is generated by a bot then determine the type of bots. We adopt an existing explainable framework to interpret the prediction of the developed deep learning model. We perform extensive experiments with real network traffic as well as synthetic traffic generated by IXIA BreakingPoint System. We compare the developed model with existing models on various performance metrics. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms the existing machine learning models with an improvement of up to $15\\%$ for all performance metrics while providing a clear explanation of the model decision.",

    "abstract": "Process monitoring is important for ensuring operational reliability and preventing occupational accidents. In recent years, data-driven methods such as machine learning and deep learning have been preferred for fault detection and diagnosis. In particular, unsupervised learning algorithms, such as auto-encoders, exhibit good detection performance, even for unlabeled data from complex processes. However, decisions generated from deep-neural-network-based models are difficult to interpret and cannot provide explanatory insight to users. We address this issue by proposing a new fault diagnosis method using explainable artificial intelligence to break the traditional trade-off between the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning model. First, an adversarial auto-encoder model for fault detection is built and then interpreted through the integration of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) with a combined monitoring index. Using SHAP values, a diagnosis is conducted by allocating credit for detected faults, deviations from a normal state, among its input variables. The proposed diagnosis method can consider not only reconstruction space but also latent space unlike conventional method, which evaluate only reconstruction error. The proposed method was applied to two chemical process systems and compared with conventional diagnosis methods. The results highlight that the proposed method achieves the exact fault diagnosis for single and multiple faults and, also, distinguishes the global pattern of various fault types.",

    "abstract": "Due to the powerful automatic feature extraction, deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods have evolved significantly in recent years. However, almost all current work focuses on detecting vulnerabilities at a single granularity ( i.e ., slice-level or function-level). In practice, slice-level vulnerability detection is fine-grained but may contain incomplete vulnerability details. Function-level vulnerability detection includes full vulnerability semantics but may contain vulnerability-unrelated statements. Meanwhile, they pay more attention to predicting whether the source code is vulnerable and cannot pinpoint which statements are more likely to be vulnerable. In this paper, we design mVulPreter , a multi-granularity vulnerability detector that can provide interpretations of detection results. Specifically, we propose a novel technique to effectively blend the advantages of function-level and slice-level vulnerability detection models and output the detection results' interpretation only by the model itself. We evaluate mVulPreter on a dataset containing 5,310 vulnerable functions and 7,601 non-vulnerable functions. The experimental results indicate that mVulPreter outperforms existing state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches ( i.e ., Checkmarx , FlawFinder , RATS , TokenCNN , StatementLSTM , SySeVR , and Devign ).",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving has attracted great attentions in recent years. Compared to traditional modular methods, end-to-end methods are more scalable in complex traffic environments, but they lack explainability. Many methods have been proposed to increase the explainability for end-to-end autonomous driving, such as using semantic bird-eye-view (BEV) maps. BEV maps can explain the outputs of end-to-end methods by showing how the networks perceive and understand surrounding traffic environments. However, there are some limitations in traditional semantic BEV maps. For instance, all regions of traffic scenes are treated equally, but the fact is that the regions near the ego vehicle are normally more critical to vehicle safety. Moreover, traditional BEV maps represent traffic scenes in the fine-grained pixel-level mode, which leads to much computational cost. To address these issues, we introduce a novel lightweight BEV perception method, PolarPoint-BEV, which prioritizes the regions according to object distances to the ego vehicle. Furthermore, we propose an explainable end-to-end autonomous driving network to investigate the influence of our PolarPoint-BEV in terms of driving performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our PolarPoint-BEV improves both the driving capability and explainability of the network.",

    "abstract": "The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a new networking paradigm that builds on top of cloud-based, multi-vendor, open and intelligent architectures to shape the next generation of cellular networks for 5G and beyond. While this new paradigm comes with many advantages in terms of observatibility and reconfigurability of the network, it inevitably expands the threat surface of cellular systems and can potentially expose its components and the Machine Learning (ML) infrastructure to several cyber attacks, thus making securing O-RAN networks a necessity. In this paper, we explore security aspects of O-RAN systems by focusing on the specifications, architectures, and intelligence proposed by the O-RAN Alliance.We address the problem of securing O-RAN systems with a holistic perspective, including considerations on the open interfaces used to interconnect the different O-RAN components, on the overall platform, and on the intelligence used to monitor and control the network. For each focus area we identify threats, discuss relevant solutions to address these issues, and demonstrate experimentally how such solutions can effectively defend O-RAN systems against selected cyber attacks. This article is the first work in approaching the security aspect of O-RAN holistically and with experimental evidence obtained on a state-of-the-art programmable O-RAN platform, providing unique guideline for researchers in the field.",

    "abstract": "Beyond fifth generation (B5G) is expected to tremendously improve network capabilities by using a higher frequency band compared to 5G, capable of delivering higher network capacity with much lower latency. It is expected that there will be around 30 billion connected objects by 2030, approximately 3.5 times the population then which underscores the pressing need for advanced network capabilities to support diverse applications ranging from smart transportation and energy management to healthcare and public safety. Network slicing enables sharing of network resources by transforming the physical network into logically independent networks, each specifically tailored to meet the requirements of heterogeneous services (e.g., Internet of things applications, gaming services, holographic communication). Each slice is an end-to-end logical network comprising network, compute, and storage resources. Softwarization and virtualization are the main drivers for innovation in B5G, enabling network developers and operators to develop network-aware applications to match customer demands. Smart cities vertical offers unique service characteristics, performance requirements, and technical challenges in B5G network slicing. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on B5G network slicing use cases, synergies, practical implementations and applications based on their quality of service parameters for smart cities applications. The paper gives a detailed taxonomy of the B5G network slicing framework requirements, design, dynamic intra-slice and inter-slice resource allocation techniques, management and orchestration, artificial intelligence/machine learning-empowered network slicing designs, implementation testbeds, 3GPP specifications and projects/standards for B5G network slicing. Furthermore, the paper provides a thorough discussion on the technical challenges that can arise when implementing B5G network slicing for smart cities applications and offers potential soluti...",

    "abstract": "Interactive visual navigation (IVN) involves tasks where embodied agents learn to interact with the objects in the environment to reach the goals. Current approaches exploit visual features to train a reinforcement learning (RL) navigation control policy network. However, RL-based methods continue to struggle at the IVN tasks as they are inefficient in learning a good representation of the unknown environment in partially observable settings. In this work, we introduce predictions of task-related latents (PTRLs), a flexible self-supervised RL framework for IVN tasks. PTRL learns the latent structured information about environment dynamics and leverages multistep representations of the sequential observations. Specifically, PTRL trains its representation by explicitly predicting the next pose of the agent conditioned on the actions. Moreover, an attention and memory module is employed to associate the learned representation to each action and exploit spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, a state value boost module is introduced to adapt the model to previously unseen environments by leveraging input perturbations and regularizing the value function. Sample efficiency in the training of RL networks is enhanced by modular training and hierarchical decomposition. Extensive evaluations have proved the superiority of the proposed method in increasing the accuracy and generalization capacity.",

    "abstract": "The inherent limitations in scaling up ground infrastructure for future wireless networks, combined with decreasing operational costs of aerial and space networks, are driving considerable research interest in multisegment ground-air-space (GAS) networks. In GAS networks, where ground and aerial users share network resources, ubiquitous and accurate user localization becomes indispensable, not only as an end-user service but also as an enabler for location-aware communications. This breaks the convention of having localization as a byproduct in networks primarily designed for communications. To address these imperative localization needs, the design and utilization of ground, aerial, and space anchors require thorough investigation. In this tutorial, we provide an in-depth systemic analysis of the radio localization problem in GAS networks, considering ground and aerial users as targets to be localized. Starting from a survey of the most relevant works, we then define the key characteristics of anchors and targets in GAS networks. Subsequently, we detail localization fundamentals in GAS networks, considering 3D positions, orientations, and velocities. Afterward, we thoroughly analyze radio localization systems in GAS networks, detailing the system model, design aspects, and considerations for each of the three GAS anchors. Preliminary results are presented to provide a quantifiable perspective on key design aspects in GAS-based localization scenarios. We then identify the vital roles 6G enablers are expected to play in radio localization in GAS networks.",

    "abstract": "Fruit harvest date prediction is crucial to optimize resource management, maximize quality, and minimize waste of this food. For this purpose, it is necessary to monitor the fruit ripening stage. However, current measurement procedures pose drawbacks for widespread field deployment: laboratory trials are manual, destructive and expensive; measurements with hand-held portable equipment in the field are very time consuming; and the use of remote sensing mobile platforms has a high operating cost. In this article, a low-cost autonomous fixed sensor for continuous on-tree monitoring of pomegranates is proposed. It is based on a computer vision system able to extract reliable fruit color and size estimations automatically. In addition, an empirical quantitative and qualitative study on the effectiveness of using image-based monitoring in comparison with in situ manual and lab-based measurements for pomegranates is provided in this work. Another contribution of this article is a harvest date prediction model that employs the fruit information collected from the images. Furthermore, a thorough quantitative evaluation of the proposed prediction model for the fruit harvest date was performed, being the median error of the best model of 3.5 days.",

    "abstract": "Massive captured face images are stored in the database for the identification of individuals. However, these images can be observed unintentionally by data examiners, which is not at the will of individuals and may cause privacy violations. Existing protection schemes can maintain identifiability but slightly change the facial appearance, rendering it still susceptible to the visual perception of the original identity by data examiners. In this paper, we propose an effective identity hider for human vision protection, which can significantly change appearance to visually hide identity while allowing identification for face recognizers. Concretely, the identity hider benefits from two specially designed modules: 1) The virtual face generation module generates a virtual face with a new appearance by manipulating the latent space of StyleGAN2. In particular, the virtual face has a similar parsing map to the original face, supporting other vision tasks such as head pose detection. 2) The appearance transfer module transfers the appearance of the virtual face into the original face via attribute replacement. Meanwhile, identity information can be preserved well with the help of the disentanglement networks. In addition, diversity and background preservation are supported to meet various requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed identity hider achieves excellent performance on privacy protection and identifiability preservation.",

Firstly, we present potential LLM applications for vertical network fields and showcase the mapping from natural language to network language. Then, several enabling technologies are investigated, including parameter-efficient finetuning and prompt engineering. The insight is that language understanding and tool usage are both required for network LLMs. Driven by the idea of embodied intelligence, we propose the ChatNet, a domain-adapted network LLM framework with access to various external network tools. ChatNet can reduce the time required for burdensome network planning tasks significantly, leading to a substantial improvement in processing efficiency. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in clinical practice, yet their real-world adoption is constrained by their propensity to produce erroneous and occasionally harmful outputs, particularly in the intricate domain of rare diseases (RDs). This study introduces RDguru, a conversational intelligent agent leveraging the LangChain framework and powered by GPT-3.5-turbo. RDguru offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities, encompassing evidence-traceable knowledge Q&A and professional medical consultations for differential diagnosis (DDX), integrating authoritative knowledge sources and reliable tools. A novel multi-source fusion diagnostic model, rooted in deep Q-network, amalgamates three diagnostic recommendation strategies (GPT-4, PheLR, and phenotype matching) to enhance diagnostic recall during medical consultations. Through tailored tools and advanced algorithms for retrieval-augmented generation, RDguru excels in knowledge Q&A, automated phenotype annotation, and RD DDX. A multi-aspect Q&A analysis demonstrates RDguru outperforms ChatGPT in generating descriptions aligned with authoritative knowledge, quantified by ROUGE scores, GPT-4-based automatic rating, and RAGAs evaluation metrics. Testing on 238 published RD cases reveals that RDguru's top 5 multi-source fusion diagnoses recapture 63.87% of actual diagnoses, marking a 5.47% improvement over the state-of-the-art diagnostic method PheLR. Furthermore, RDguru's consultation strategy proves effective in eliciting diagnostically beneficial phenotypes and refining the prioritization of genuine diagnoses through multi-round phenotype-orient questioning. Evaluations against established benchmarks and real-world patient data demonstrate RDguru's efficacy and reliability, highlighting its potential to enhance clinical decision-making in the realm of RDs.",

    "abstract": "Current constrained reinforcement learning (RL) methods guarantee constraint satisfaction only in expectation, which is inadequate for safety-critical decision problems. Since a constraint satisfied in expectation remains a high probability of exceeding the cost threshold, solving constrained RL problems with high probabilities of satisfaction is critical for RL safety. In this work, we consider the safety criterion as a constraint on the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of cumulative costs, and propose the CVaR-constrained policy optimization algorithm (CVaR-CPO) to maximize the expected return while ensuring agents pay attention to the upper tail of constraint costs. According to the bound on the CVaR-related performance between two policies, we first reformulate the CVaR-constrained problem in augmented state space using the state extension procedure and the trust-region method. CVaR-CPO then derives the optimal update policy by applying the Lagrangian method to the constrained optimization problem. In addition, CVaR-CPO utilizes the distribution of constraint costs to provide an efficient quantile-based estimation of the CVaR-related value function. We conduct experiments on constrained control tasks to show that the proposed method can produce behaviors that satisfy safety constraints, and achieve comparable performance to most safe RL (SRL) methods.",

    "abstract": "Federated Unlearning (FU) is gaining prominence for its capability to eliminate influences of specific users' data from trained global Federated Learning (FL) models. A straightforward FU method involves removing the unlearned user-specified data and subsequently obtaining a new global FL model from scratch with all remaining user data, a process that unfortunately leads to considerable overhead. To enhance unlearning efficiency, a widely adopted strategy employs clustering, dividing FL users into clusters, with each cluster maintaining its own FL model. The final inference is then determined by aggregating the majority vote from the inferences of these sub-models. This method confines unlearning processes to individual clusters for removing the training data of a particular user, thereby enhancing unlearning efficiency by eliminating the need for participation from all remaining user data. However, current clustering-based FU schemes mainly concentrate on refining clustering to boost unlearning efficiency but without addressing the issue of the potential information leakage from FL users' gradients, a privacy concern that has been extensively studied. Typically, integrating secure aggregation (SecAgg) schemes within each cluster can facilitate a privacy-preserving FU. Nevertheless, crafting a clustering methodology that seamlessly incorporates SecAgg schemes is challenging, particularly in scenarios involving adversarial users and dynamic users. In this connection, we systematically explore the integration of SecAgg protocols within the most widely used federated unlearning scheme, which is based on clustering, to establish a privacy-preserving FU framework, aimed at ensuring privacy while effectively managing dynamic user participation. Comprehensive theoretical assessments and experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves comparable unlearning effectiveness, alongside offering improved privacy protection and resilience in the face of varying user pa...",

One can, for example, exploit the intermediate layer neurons to generate transferable adversarial samples. However, current works show limitations in providing feature-level attack mechanisms across multiple victim models. In light of the attribution methods, in this paper, we investigate the attribution similarity across different models. We leverage the similarity to incorporate different attribution properties to enhance the sample transferability, for the first time, formulating a novel neuron attribution-based transferable attack termed DANAA++. Specifically, we utilise a range of adversarial attack methods to generate different baseline points through adversarial training. The attribution results are thus obtained along both linear and nonlinear integration paths. In our experiments, the baseline points and integration paths si...",

    "abstract": "The collaboration among multiple agents demands for efficient communication. However, the observational data in the multi-agent systems are typically voluminous and redundant and pose substantial challenges to the communication system when transmitted directly. To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-agent communication scheme based on large language model (LLM), referred to as GPT-based semantic information extraction for multi-agent communication (GMAC). This scheme utilizes an LLM to extract semantic information and leverages the generative capabilities to predict subsequent actions, thereby enabling agents to make more informed decisions. The GMAC approach significantly reduces signaling expenditure exchanged among agents by extracting key semantic data via LLM. This method not only simplifies the communication process but also effectively reduces the communication overhead by approximately 53% compared to the baseline methods. Experimental results indicate that GMAC not only improves the convergence speed and accuracy of decision-making but also substantially decreases the signaling expenditure among agents. Consequently, GMAC offers a straightforward and effective method to achieve efficient and economical communication in the multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "Distributed deep learning (DL) training constitutes a significant portion of workloads in modern data centers that are equipped with high computational capacities, such as GPU servers. However, frequent tensor exchanges among workers during distributed deep neural network (DNN) training can result in heavy traffic in the data center network, leading to congestion at server NICs and in the switching network. Unfortunately, none of the existing DL communication libraries support active flow control to optimize tensor transmission performance, instead relying on passive adjustments to the congestion window or sending rate based on packet loss or delay. To address this issue, we propose a flow scheduler per host that dynamically tunes the sending rates of outgoing tensor flows from each server, maximizing network bandwidth utilization and expediting job training progress. Our scheduler comprises two main components: a monitoring module that interacts with state-of-the-art communication libraries supporting parameter server and all-reduce paradigms to track the training progress of DNN jobs, and a congestion control protocol that receives in-network feedback from traversing switches and computes optimized flow sending rates. For data centers where switches are not programmable, we provide a software solution that emulates switch behavior and interacts with the scheduler on servers. Experiments with real-world GPU testbed and trace-driven simulation demonstrate that our scheduler outperforms common rate control protocols and representative learning-based schemes in various settings.",

    "abstract": "Current reinforcement learning approaches for grasping do not consider force feedback combined with compliant grippers, but these features are suited to grocery object grasping, where objects can be bruised by high forces, and exhibit varied weights, textures, and surface irregularities. This work combines force feedback with reinforcement learning on a compliant gripper. We design a three degrees of freedom caging inspired gripper, which can grasp by trapping objects with three compliant fingers and a movable palm. We instrument the fingers with strain gauges for force sensing, then, model their bending for simulating grasping at 16.8Ã real time. Then, we train a reinforcement learning grasping controller based on in-grasp force feedback, with real world transfer achieving 98.0% grasp success rate on training objects, with an average sim2real gap of 3.1%. We demonstrate generalization to 42 novel grocery objects with a success rate of 95.0%, with 80.1% of grasps tolerating a 5 N vertical disturbance. In-grasp finger forces averaged 1.4 and palm forces 3.0 N. We also validate our method with three finger rigidities, show that our model and in-grasp sensing improve learning and performance, and compare against three baselines.",

    "abstract": "In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, how to reliably acquire downlink channel state information (CSI) with low overhead is challenging. In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.

    "abstract": "Designing affect-based personalized technology involves dealing with large datasets. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are employed to predict affect and similar human factors from in-game metrics, behavioral patterns, or physiological responses. The classification performance is usually presented as a global point estimate without providing user-specific interpretations. This approach is incompatible with effective personalization in games because it disregards the variability of body responses between players. This paper proposes a methodology to classify subjective human factors from large multimodal data. A public VR dataset (CEAP-360VR) was used to extensively compare three ML classifiers and five feature importance techniques. The produced models could reduce the original feature space by 82% (from 113 to 20 features) without compromising predictive performance (F1 score). A random forest (RF) using forward sequential feature selection (fSFS) yielded the best prediction of binary valence (F1=0.761) and arousal (F1=0.748). Finally, feature importance rankings are discussed with emphasis on global and user-specific patterns that may improve affect recognition. The proposed methodology is envisioned to help game designers and researchers create customized user-centric games and VR experiences inferring possible explanations from multimodal datasets.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technologies, networking, and artificial intelligence, mechatronics has continuously evolved for several generations from traditional mechatronics to digital twins (DT-I), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), human CPSs , and to metaverse nowadays. This article examines such a development trend from a new perspective in enhancing the sustainability of products or systems. To fill the technical gaps of existing concepts in supporting sustainable developments of next-generation mechatronic systems, we propose the concepts of digital triads (DT-II) and Internet of DT-II things ; these concepts aim to expand the capabilities of mechatronic systems in dealing with changes and uncertainties in dynamic business environments and prolonging systemsâ lifespans through technological integration. For example, DT-II is innovative in the sense that it extends the capabilities of CPS or DT-I by introducing a life model so that relevant data, models, and methods can be preserved and transferred when a product or system needs reconfiguring to satisfy new requirements. DT-II promotes concurrent engineering in decision-making supports in the digital and physical worlds so that a product or system can be reconfigured to satisfy new requirements optimally. This smoothens the transitions in sustainable manufacturing and prolongs the enterprise's lifespan. To showcase the use and significance of DT-II, a case study of DT-II for sustainable product development is developed to predict the performance of new products for a client company. The developed DT-II is fully verified and validated for use, and the proposed procedure is generalized and can be used to develop DT-II for other products and systems for enhanced sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligenge (GAI) is revolutionizing the world with its unprecedented content creation ability. Large Language Model (LLM) is one of its most embraced branches. However, due to LLMâs substantial size and resource-intensive nature, it is cloud-hosted, raising concerns about privacy, usage limitations, and latency. In this paper, we propose to utilize ubiquitous distributed wireless edge computing resources for real-time LLM inference. Specifically, we introduce a novel LLM edge inference framework, incorporating batching and model quantization to ensure high throughput inference on resource-limited edge devices. Then, based on the architecture of transformer decoder-based LLMs, we formulate an edge inference optimization problem which is NP-hard, considering batch scheduling and joint allocation of communication and computation resources. The solution is the optimal throughput under edge resource constraints and heterogeneous user requirements on latency and accuracy. To solve this NP-hard problem, we develop an OT-GAH (Optimal Tree-search with Generalized Assignment Heuristics) algorithm with reasonable complexity and 1/2-approximation ratio. We first design the OT algorithm with online tree-pruning for single-edge-node multiuser case, which navigates the inference request selection within the tree structure to miximize throughput. We then consider the multi-edge-node case and propose the GAH algorithm, which recrusively invokes the OT in each nodeâs inference scheduling iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of OT-GAH batching over other benchmarks, revealing an over 45% time complexity reduction compared to brute-force searching.",

    "abstract": "The state of the art has numerous contributions which focus on combating the DDoS attacks. We argue that the mitigation methods are only useful if the victim service or the mitigation method can ascertain the presence of a DDoS attack. In many of the past solutions, the authors decide the presence of DDoS using quick and dirty checks. However, precise mechanisms are still needed so that the accurate decisions about DDoS mitigation can be made. In this work, we propose a method for detecting the presence of DDoS attacks using system variables available at the server or victim server operating system. To achieve this, we propose a machine learning based detection model in which there are three steps involved. In the first step, we monitored 14 different systems and application variables/ characteristics with and without a variety of DDoS attacks. In the second step, we trained machine learning model with monitored data of all the selected variables. In the final step, our approach uses the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) based approaches to detect the presence of DDoS attacks. Our presence identification approach gives a detection accuracy of 88%-95% for massive attacks, 65%-77% for mixed traffic having a mixture of low-rate attack and benign requests, 58%-60% for flashcrowd, 76%-81% for mixed traffic having a mixture of massive attack and benign traffic and 58%-64% for low rate attacks with a detection time of 4-5 seconds.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a feasible solution for autonomous driving as it can offload latency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks from vehicle terminals to roadside units (RSUs) for real-time processing. Due to the high computational resource the workflow applications (i.e., autonomous driving) required, the small vehicle-to-RSUs communication range, and the scarce available resources for each vehicle, it might be difficult to accomplish complex workflow applications through the single-hop offloading paradigm in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based multi-hop computation offloading scheme for workflow applications to reduce their execution latency in the VEC networks, which considers the data dependency in workflow applications as well as the trust relationship and communication interference among RSUs. Firstly, a preprocessing method is employed to merge the cut-edges in a workflow to reduce the offloading scale of tasks and compress the encoding dimension of offloading solutions. Then, a Deep Q-network algorithm using Phase-optimal State update (DQPS) is proposed to update the offloading policy distribution, in which the deviation of the phase-optimal state from the current state is estimated as the reward of RL to promote the algorithmâs convergence to adapt the dynamic VEC networks. Simulation results show that DQPS has the best performance compared to other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the latency of the identical applications can be reduced by 2.5%-25.3% through our offloading scheme with a multi-hop model compared to that with the single-hop paradigm in IoV.",

    "abstract": "On-device training of DNNs allows models to adapt and fine-tune to newly collected data or changing domains while deployed on microcontroller units (MCUs). However, DNN training is a resource-intensive task, making the implementation and execution of DNN training algorithms on MCUs challenging due to low processor speeds, constrained throughput, limited floating-point support, and memory constraints. In this work, we explore on-device training DNNs for different sized Cortex-M MCUs (Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7). We present a method that enables efficient training of DNNs completely in place on the MCU using fully quantized training (FQT) and dynamic partial gradient updates. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple vision and time-series datasets and provide insights into the tradeoff between training accuracy, memory overhead, energy, and latency on real hardware. The results show that compared to related work, our approach requires 34.8% less memory and has a 49.0% lower latency per training sample, with dynamic partial gradient updates allowing a speedup of up to 8.7 compared to fully updating all weights.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for analyzing signals such as sounds and images, thanks to its capabilities of automatically extracting relevant patterns as well as its end-to-end training properties. When applied to tabular structured data, DL has exhibited some performance limitations compared to shallow learning techniques. This work presents a novel technique for tabular data called adaptive multiscale attention deep neural network architecture (also named excited attention). By exploiting parallel multilevel feature weighting, the adaptive multiscale attention can successfully learn the feature attention and thus achieve high levels of F1-score on seven different classification tasks (on small, medium, large, and very large datasets) and low mean absolute errors on four regression tasks of different size. In addition, adaptive multiscale attention provides four levels of explainability (i.e., comprehension of its learning process and therefore of its outcomes): 1) calculates attention weights to determine which layers are most important for given classes; 2) shows each featureâs attention across all instances; 3) understands learned feature attention for each class to explore feature attention and behavior for specific classes; and 4) finds nonlinear correlations between co-behaving features to reduce dataset dimensionality and improve interpretability. These interpretability levels, in turn, allow for employing adaptive multiscale attention as a useful tool for feature ranking and feature selection.",

    "abstract": "The Cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure in the inner ear, plays a crucial role in the process of hearing by converting sound waves into electrical signals that the brain can interpret. This study introduces a cost-effective adaptation of 2D artificial Cochlea mathematical modeling using a planar approximation technique. The main novelty and contribution of our work is a method employs surface-based functions and is known as the Surface-Based Approximation Model of Cochlea (SBAMoC). By simplifying complex multiplication processes in nonlinear components, the SBAMoC reduces costs and enhances efficiency, making it suitable for FPGA implementation with minimal hardware requirements. The proposed model is evaluated in scenarios involving two-coupled oscillations and grid-based cochlear networks to better understand its performance. Through hardware synthesis on a Virtex-II board, the SBAMoC demonstrates improved efficiency and reduced computational expenses compared to the original model, achieving faster speeds and greater cost-effectiveness. In practical tests, the SBAMoC exhibits higher operational speeds and increased scalability, outperforming the original model by replicating accurate cochlear behaviors with minimal deviations. Specifically, the single SBAMoC implementation in our model achieves a speed boost of approximately 1.333 times compared to the original model (381.292 MHz vs. 286.029 MHz) and supports a greater number of fitted SBAMoCs (75 vs. 35), showcasing its superior efficiency and performance enhancements. In case of real-world applications, it can be considered for the development of more efficient and cost-effective cochlear implants, leading to improved hearing restoration solutions for individuals with hearing impairments. Also, the findings from this study could also be leveraged to enhance the design and implementation of signal processing systems in various audio and communication devices, paving the way for advanced audio processing technolog...",

    "abstract": "By decoupling substrate resources, network virtualization (NV) is a promising solution for meeting diverse demands and ensuring differentiated quality of service (QoS). In particular, virtual network embedding (VNE) is a critical enabling technology that enhances the flexibility and scalability of network deployment by addressing the coupling of Internet processes and services. However, in the existing deep neural networks (DNNs)-based works, the black-box nature DNNs limits the analysis, development, and improvement of systems. For example, in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), there is a conflict between decision interpretability and the opacity of DNN-based methods. In recent times, interpretable deep learning (DL) represented by deep neuro fuzzy systems (DNFS) combined with fuzzy inference has shown promising interpretability to further exploit the hidden value in the data. Motivated by this, we propose a DNFS-based VNE algorithm that aims to provide an interpretable NV scheme. Specifically, data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as fuzzy implication operators to compute the embedding probabilities of candidate substrate nodes through entailment operations. And, the identified fuzzy rule patterns are cached into the weights by forward computation and gradient back-propagation (BP). Moreover, the fuzzy rule base is constructed based on Mamdani-type linguistic rules using linguistic labels. In addition, the DNFS-driven five-block structure-based policy network serves as the agent for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which optimizes VNE decision-making through interaction with the environment. Finally, the effectiveness of evaluation indicators and fuzzy rules is verified by simulation experiments.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare, training examples are usually hard to obtain (e.g., cases of a rare disease), or the cost of labelling data is high. With a large number of features ( $p$ ) be measured in a relatively small number of samples ( $N$ ), the âbig $p$ , small $N$ â problem is an important subject in healthcare studies, especially on the genomic data. Another major challenge of effectively analyzing medical data is the skewed class distribution caused by the imbalance between different class labels. In addition, feature importance and interpretability play a crucial role in the success of solving medical problems. Therefore, in this paper, we present an interpretable deep embedding model (IDEM) to classify new data having seen only a few training examples with highly skewed class distribution. IDEM model consists of a feature attention layer to learn the informative features, a feature embedding layer to directly deal with both numerical and categorical features, a siamese network with contrastive loss to compare the similarity between learned embeddings of two input samples. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world medical data demonstrate that our IDEM model has better generalization power than conventional approaches with few and imbalanced training medical samples, and it is able to identify which features contribute to the classifier in distinguishing case and control.",

    "abstract": "Intent inferral on a hand orthosis for stroke patients is challenging due to the difficulty of data collection. Additionally, EMG signals exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions, and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition, session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient session, including the use of the classifier for functional orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a power-efficient 28-Gb/s single-ended four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transceiver (TRX) for next-generation memory interfaces. In the transmitter (TX), an active-inductor equalizer (EQ\nAI\n) is utilized, while in the receiver (RX), an amplitude-detection least significant bit (LSB) decoder is employed. In the TX, conventional equalization techniques consume substantial power owing to the inclusion of additional components and strong driving power required to mitigate channel-induced intersymbol interference (ISI). However, the proposed EQ\nAI\nachieves a bandwidth extension up to the Nyquist frequency through gain boosting while reducing hardware costs and minimizing the driving strength. This results in a simple structure with operational efficiency, facilitating low power consumption and a compact area compared with conventional TX equalizers. In PAM-4 RX, the power dissipation is proportional to the clock buffer and the number of comparators used for data decoding. To improve the hardware cost and the power usage in the RX, the proposed RX design utilizes an amplitude-detection LSB decoder, which reduces the number of comparators and comprises a one-stage structure by detecting the amplitude differences between the reference and input voltages during LSB decoding. This ensures the hardware cost and power consumption improvement while implementing a one-tap direct decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The TRX for memory interfaces is optimized for low-power performance by employing these methods, resulting in a notable energy efficiency of 0.96 pJ/bit. This structure is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, and the core area of the TRX occupies 0.0053 mm\n2\n.",

    "abstract": "IoT-enabled consumer electronics can collect and analyze data to improve functionality and user experiences, increasingly becoming part of edge computing networks. Decentralized federated learning is envisioned as a promising AIoT framework to leverage the data generated by these interconnected consumer electronics without compromising user privacy, where computations are performed closer to the data source rather than in a centralized cloud-based data center. However, a number of obstacles bottleneck the deployment of decentralized learning frameworks under a large-scale AIoT scenario, such as heterogeneity issues, communication efficiency, large-scale issues and others. Specifically, heterogeneity issues include diverse learning models, non-i.i.d. data distribution and unbalanced datasets. In this paper, we propose a trustworthy and adaptive knowledge distillation based decentralized federated learning framework to overcome a number of heterogeneity and large-scale issues. To achieve this goal, we formulate a decentralized optimization problem which formally presents various heterogeneity issues. The proposed framework is composed of two components, including a knowledge distillation based algorithm to transfer knowledge over diverse learning models as well as a real-time evaluation module to adapt client drift issues. Convergence analysis demonstrates that the convergence of the proposed framework is guaranteed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over three public datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed framework in the large-scale IoT scenario, illustrating that the proposed framework could significantly improve the learning performance over various metrics and outperforming state-of-the-art baseline approaches.",

    "abstract": "The Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) is an interpretable neural network that leverages high-level concepts to explain model decisions and conduct human-machine interaction. However, in real-world scenarios, the deficiency of informative concepts can impede the model's interpretability and subsequent interventions. This paper proves that insufficient concept information can lead to an inherent dilemma of concept and label distortions in CBM. To address this challenge, we propose the Decoupling Concept Bottleneck Model (DCBM), which comprises two phases: 1) DCBM for prediction and interpretation, which decouples heterogeneous information into explicit and implicit concepts while maintaining high label and concept accuracy, and 2) DCBM for human-machine interaction, which automatically corrects labels and traces wrong concepts via mutual information estimation. The construction of the interaction system can be formulated as a light min-max optimization problem. Extensive experiments expose the success of alleviating concept/label distortions, especially when concepts are insufficient. In particular, we propose the Concept Contribution Score (CCS) to quantify the interpretability of DCBM. Numerical results demonstrate that CCS can be guaranteed by the Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint in DCBM. Moreover, DCBM expresses two effective human-machine interactions, including forward intervention and backward rectification, to further promote concept/label accuracy via interaction with human experts.",

    "abstract": "Training drones to execute complex collective tasks via multi-agent reinforcement learning presents significant challenges. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Task-Activated Language model-based Knowledge-Extension Reasoning system. Specifically, we trained drones in two fine-grained skills and developed an action primitive library based on these capabilities, enabling a hierarchical approach to managing complex swarm operations. Leveraging this primitive library, we employ large language models to perform task planning, continuously refining the planning outcomes based on external user feedback. Successful task codes are temporarily stored within the action primitive library, with their utilization being authorized based on internal feedback from maintainers. We defined this process as knowledge expansion. In addition, more refined customized prompts are generated based on task descriptions and the action primitive documentation, a mechanism referred to as Task Activation. Our system synergistically integrates task activation and knowledge expansion mechanisms, enabling continuous evolution through human feedback to effectively manage extensive swarms in the execution of complex collective tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our system in various drone swarm tasks, including collaborative search, object tracking, cooperative interception, and aerial patrol.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities are increasingly challenged by population growth and the environmental emissions of urban transportation systems, necessitating sustainable urban planning to improve public health, environmental quality, and overall urban livability. A notable aspect in this context is the under-utilization of smart healthcare wearable devices or smart healthcare applications in urban transportation systems. This paper proposes an innovative approach to address these challenges effectively. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem aimed at minimizing environmental emissions within transportation systems while considering resident health goals, travel time constraints, and infrastructure limitations. To achieve this, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which dynamically selects the optimal traveling mode for residents. This approach aims to optimize environmental outcomes while meeting individualized mobility needs. Moreover, our method integrates smart healthcare technologies to capture real-time data and predict optimal traveling modes. By incorporating real-world health metrics into transportation planning, we enhance decision-making processes and promote active transportation options, contributing to healthier urban environments. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing traveling decisions and advancing sustainable urban mobility practices. Our DRL-based solution effectively promotes active travel, leading to a significant increase in health-related metrics (like calories burned) and a substantial reduction in gCO2 emissions. Up to 74% of journeys were made using active transportation modes. Cycling is particularly popular, accounting for up to 67% of journeys.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond 5G (B5G) are crucial for revolutionizing various industries, including surveillance, agriculture, and logistics, by enabling high-speed data transfer, ultra-low latency communication, and ultra-reliable connectivity. However, integrating UAVs into B5G networks poses various security and privacy concerns. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks which jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Moreover, UAVs in B5G networks are also at high risk from the application of machine learning (ML)-based attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial manipulation, data poisoning and model evasion techniques, which can compromise the integrity of UAV operations, lead to navigation errors, and expose sensitive data collected by UAVs. Considering the aforementioned security and privacy concerns, this review article presents emerging security and privacy solutions for UAVs in B5G networks. Firstly, We introduce the essential background of integrating UAVs into B5G networks and discuss the advantages and security challenges which the emerging integrated network architecture have. Then, we proceed to analyze and examine the security and privacy landscape by including threats and requirements of UAVs in B5G networks. Based on these threats and requirements, solutions from physical layer security (PLS), blockchain (BC), federated learning (FL) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are discussed and explored in details. Moreover, potential future research directions are discussed in details as open research issues.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy integral fusion has been shown as an effective tool for enhancing classification accuracy while also achieving explainability. With the deep learning boom in the past decade, many researchers have investigated the advantages of fusing various deep neural networks with fuzzy integral techniques in computer vision. However, recent studies focus on only the explainable fusion process. Thus, features learned by each deep neural network are difficult to understand. Moreover, deep neural networks are usually trained on the ImageNet dataset. Whereas the effectiveness of applying the fuzzy integral methods to this dataset is yet to be investigated. This is the gap that motivates our research study. To address this issue, we explore fuzzy integral fusion classification models that make both the fusion process and extracted features explainable. Specifically, we use two well-known fuzzy integral fusion methods (i.e., Sugeno integral and Choquet integral) to combine three explainable deep learning features (i.e., shape, texture, and color) in a manner that mimics human visual recognition processes. The originality of our work includes the emphasis on complete explainability in the classification process, the investigation of applying fuzzy integral methods to the ImageNet dataset, and extensive experimental validation of the effectiveness of fuzzy integral. Computational experiments show that fuzzy integral fusion can improve classification accuracy by 14.6% compared with an individual deep neural network on subsets derived from the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, fuzzy integral fusion helps understand contributions, relationships, and interactions among the three features (shape, texture, and color) for each class, providing convincing evidence for the final classification result. Consequently, the proposed models not only achieve impressive performance but also provide a thorough understanding of how these models work. The code is available at https://github.com/yifanw...",

    "abstract": "This study investigates vulnerabilities of future generation non-volatile memory (NVM)-backed persistent TinyML hardware neural networks to side-channel attacks (SCA) using electromagnetic (EM) analysis methods. We trained three different tinyML models: MobileNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet on three different standard datasets: F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MNIST. The trained networks were then mapped on to a custom FPGANVM setup for EM-SCA evaluation. We demonstrate that the information about the stored model parameters/weights can be extracted by applying statistical methods on the collected EM emanation data. Further, we demonstrate that the obtained model parametric information can be used for cloning some of the lightweight edge TinyML models with only 0.5% to 10 training dataset.",

    "abstract": "With the remarkable success of deep neural networks, there is a growing interest in research aimed at providing clear interpretations of their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce Attribution Equilibrium, a novel method to decompose output predictions into fine-grained attributions, balancing positive and negative relevance for clearer visualization of the evidence behind a network decision. We carefully analyze conventional approaches to decision explanation and present a different perspective on the conservation of evidence. We define the evidence as a gap between positive and negative influences among gradient-derived initial contribution maps. Then, we incorporate antagonistic elements and a user-defined criterion for the degree of positive attribution during propagation. Additionally, we consider the role of inactivated neurons in the propagation rule, thereby enhancing the discernment of less relevant elements such as the background. We conduct various assessments in a verified experimental environment with PASCAL VOC 2007, MS COCO 2014, and ImageNet datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively in identifying the key input features that influence model decisions.",

    "abstract": "In some applications, edge learning is experiencing a shift in focusing from conventional learning from scratch to new two-stage learning unifying pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. This paper considers the problem of joint communication and computation resource management in a two-stage edge learning system. In this system, model pre-training is first conducted at an edge server via centralized learning on local pre-stored general data, and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed at edge devices based on the pre-trained model via federated edge learning. For the two-stage learning model, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the average squared gradient norm bound), which characterizes the impacts of various system parameters such as the number of learning rounds and batch sizes in the two stages on the convergence rate. Based on our analytical results, we then propose a joint communication and computation resource management design to minimize an average squared gradient norm bound, subject to constraints on the transmit power, overall system energy consumption, and training delay. The decision variables include the number of learning rounds, batch sizes, clock frequencies, and transmit power control for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design. It is shown that the proposed joint resource management over the pre-training and fine-tuning stages well balances the system performance trade-off among the training accuracy, delay, and energy consumption. The proposed design is also shown to effectively leverage the inherent trade-off between pre-training and fine-tuning, which arises from the differences in data distribution between pre-stored general data versus real-time task-specific data, thus efficiently optimizing overall system performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel FPGA-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for continuous radio data processing, specifically targeting modulation classification on the Zynq UltraScale+ Radio Frequency System on Chip (RFSoC) operating in real-time. Evaluated on AMDs RFSoC2x2 development board, the design integrates General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) optimisations and fixed-point arithmetic. We also present a method for creating Deep Learning (DL) data sets for wireless communications, incorporating the RFSoC into the data generation loop. Furthermore, we explore quantised-aware training, producing three modulation classification models with different fixed-point weight precisions (16-bit, 8-bit, and 4-bit). We interface with the implemented hardware through the open-source PYNQ project, which combines Python with programmable logic interaction, enabling realtime modulation prediction via a PYNQ-enabled Jupyter app. The three models, operating at a 128 MHz sampling rate prior to the decimation stage, were evaluated for accuracy and resource consumption. The 16-bit model achieved the highest accuracy with minimal additional resource usage compared to the 8-bit and 4-bit models, making it the optimal choice for deploying a modulation classifier at the receiver.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring good data quality in biomedical sciences is crucial for reliable research outcomes, particularly as precision medicine continues to gain prominence. Missing values compromise data quality and can difficult to perform data-based studies. The origins of missing values in biomedical datasets are diverse, including experimental errors, equipment malfunctions, and variations in data collection protocols tailored to individual patient conditions. To address the complex nature of missing values and the unique characteristics of biomedical data, a diverse spectrum of computational imputation techniques has emerged. These methods range from traditional statistical analysis to more modern approaches such as discriminative machine learning models and deep generative networks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the extensive literature on missing data imputation techniques, with a specific focus on applications in genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing, health records, and medical imaging. We outline the fundamental principles underlying each imputation technique and present a detailed analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, categorized by missing data patterns. To aid practitioners in method selection, we offer practical recommendations based on critical factors such as dataset size, data type, and missingness rate. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we provide a holistic perspective on the effectiveness of various imputation methods under different biomedical contexts, thereby facilitating informed decision-making for researchers and practitioners in applying imputation techniques to biomedical data processing.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modality learning, exemplified by the language-image pair pre-trained CLIP model, has demonstrated remarkable performance in enhancing zero-shot capabilities and has gained significant attention recently. However, simply applying language-image pre-trained CLIP to medical image analysis encounters substantial domain shifts, resulting in severe performance degradation due to inherent disparities between natural (non-medical) and medical image characteristics. To address this challenge and uphold or even enhance CLIPâs zero-shot capability in medical image analysis, we develop a novel approach, Core-Periphery feature alignment for CLIP (CP-CLIP), to model medical images and corresponding clinical text jointly. To achieve this, we design an auxiliary neural network whose structure is organized by the core-periphery (CP) principle. This auxiliary CP network not only aligns medical image and text features into a unified latent space more efficiently but also ensures alignment driven by principles of brain network organization. In this way, our approach effectively mitigates and further enhances CLIPâs zero-shot performance in medical image analysis. More importantly, the proposed CP-CLIP exhibits excellent explanatory capability, enabling the automatic identification of critical disease-related regions in clinical analysis. Extensive experiments and evaluation across five public datasets covering different diseases underscore the superiority of our CP-CLIP in zero-shot medical image prediction and critical features detection, showing its promising utility in multimodal feature alignment in current medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a company, poses significant challenges for businesses in various industries, including the banking sector. In this paper, we address the problem of customer churn in the banking sector by selecting and applying four machine learning algorithms on the dataset of the U.S Bank in the case of Imbalance and Balance to predict the churn of customers from financial institutions such as banks and the reasons that drive them to do so. The algorithms were Logistics Regression, SVM, Neural network and Random Forest. The CRISP model was followed for the necessary processing and analysis, as it became clear after that the Random Forest algorithm provided better results in all cases. Consequently, this paper attempted to provide a better improvement to the results obtained from the default Random-Forest algorithm by understanding its working mechanism and adjusting its hyperparameters. Therefore, a mathematical model was proposed and built for the default Random Forest algorithm as a new version of it called ERFA. The final results of ERFA were positive through an increase in prediction accuracy from 85% to 86% in the case of the imbalanced dataset and from 89% to 91% in the case of balanced dataset. The outcomes of this study can help and motivate bank managers in general and in Yemen in particular to adopt this type of smart strategies to maintain their customers and provide them with a better experience. Furthermore, the mechanism established by this paper may help researchers who are interested in the field of developing smart business models.",

    "abstract": "Accurate extraction of heart rate from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals remains challenging due to motion artifacts and signal degradation. Although deep learning methods trained as a data-driven inference problem offer promising solutions, they often underutilize existing knowledge from the medical and signal processing community. In this paper, we address three shortcomings of deep learning models: motion artifact removal, degradation assessment, and physiologically plausible analysis of the PPG signal. We propose KID-PPG, a knowledge-informed deep learning model that integrates expert knowledge through adaptive linear filtering, deep probabilistic inference, and data augmentation. We evaluate KID-PPG on the PPGDalia dataset, achieving an average mean absolute error of 2.85 beats per minute, surpassing existing reproducible methods. Our results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in heart rate tracking through the incorporation of prior knowledge into deep learning models. This approach shows promise in enhancing various biomedical applications by incorporating existing expert knowledge in deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "Effective state-of-health (SoH) estimation is highly valuable for ensuring battery performance and safety. This article proposes an ultrasonic wave-based method for the accurate and rapid SoH estimation of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, enabled by combining the benefits of nondestructive ultrasonic detection and interpretable data-driven solution. In particular, an Li-ion battery is externally equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to promise fast real-time measurement of the ultrasonic signal with high spatial resolution and reproducibility. Following this endeavor, an explainable data-driven solution based on the enhanced interpretable generalized additive model with interactions (EI-GAMIs) is proposed to rapidly estimate battery SoH and explain the effects of the involved ultrasonic features of interest. Illustrative results disclose that with the guided ultrasound wave which can be obtained in microsecond level especially for a state-of-charge (SoC) range of 40%â60%, Li-ion battery SoH could be estimated precisely in real time with an R2 above 0.99 via the proposed method. Moreover, the contributions of the main effect and pairwise interaction terms derived from six ultrasonic features could be quantified, while the global and local interpretations of their dynamic influences are well explained. This can help engineers to quickly obtain reliable information about battery health in real-world applications, which in turn will benefit the health management of Li-ion batteries.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) is the process of finding an unknown mathematical expression given the input and output and has important applications in interpretable machine learning and knowledge discovery. The major difficulty of SR is that finding the expression structure is an NP-hard problem, which makes the entire process time-consuming. In this study, the solution of expression structures was regarded as a classification problem and solved by supervised learning such that SR can be solved quickly by using the solving experience. Techniques for classification tasks, such as equivalent label merging and sample balance, were used to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. We proposed a symbolic network called DeepSymNet to represent symbolic expressions to improve the performance of the algorithm. DeepSymNet has been proven to have a strong representation ability with a shorter label compared to the current popular representation methods, reducing the search space when predicting. Moreover, DeepSymNet conveniently decomposes SR into two smaller subproblems, which makes solving the problem easier. The proposed algorithm was tested on artificially generated expressions and public datasets and compared with other algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) ushered in a new era of machine learning with interconnected datasets. While traditional neural networks can only be trained on independent samples, GNN allows for the inclusion of intersample interactions in the training process. This gain, however, incurs additional memory cost, rendering most GNNs unscalable for real-world applications involving vast and complicated networks with tens of millions of nodes (e.g., social circles, web graphs, and brain graphs). This means that storing the graph in the main memory can be difficult, let alone training the GNN model with significantly less GPU memory. While much of the recent literature has focused on either mini-batching GNN methods or quantization, graph reduction methods remain largely scarce. Furthermore, present graph reduction approaches have several drawbacks. First, most graph reduction focuses only on the inference stage (e.g., condensation, pruning, and distillation) and requires full graph GNN training, which does not reduce training memory footprint. Second, many methods focus solely on the graphâs structural aspect, ignoring the initial population feature-label distribution, resulting in a skewed postreduction label distribution. Here, we propose a feature-label constrained graph net collapse (FALCON) to address these limitations. Our three core contributions lie in: 1) designing FALCON, a topology-aware graph reduction technique that preserves feature-label distribution by introducing a $K$ -means clustering with a novel dimension-normalized Euclidean distance; 2) implementation of FALCON with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) memory reduction methods (i.e., mini-batched GNN and quantization) for further memory reduction; and 3) extensive benchmarking and ablation studies against SOTA methods to evaluate FALCON memory reduction. Our comprehensive results show that FALCON can significantly collapse various public datasets (e.g., PPI and Flickr to as low as 34% of the total nodes) ...",

    "abstract": "Split federated learning (SFL) is a recently proposed distributed collaborative learning architecture that integrates federated learning (FL) with split learning (SL), offering an ingenious solution for safeguarding privacy in resource-limited environments. Despite the compelling potential of SFL and its appealing attributes, its robustness remains uncharted territory. In this paper, we investigate the security and robustness of SFL, with a specific focus on its susceptibility to malicious client-driven poisoning attacks. Specifically, we study the weaknesses of SFL against the well-known poisoning attacks designed for FL, like dataset poisoning, weight poisoning, and label poisoning. We also introduce a novel type of poisoning attacks tailored for SFL, named smash poisoning, and evaluate the robustness against smash poisoning attacks and advanced hybrid attacks (DatasetSmash, LabelSmash, and WeightSmash) that amalgamate smash poisoning with the other three methods for FL. By simulating these attacks across diverse domains over four datasets, we find that most of these attacks (including weight, WeightSmash, and LabelSmash poisoning) can disrupt the converged models with straightforward poisoning actions or have persistent negative influence on the model accuracy even after the termination of the attacks. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the robustness of SFL can be augmented by strategically adjusting the system parameters, such as client quantity, bottleneck size, or split type. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the typical defense mechanisms of poisoning attacks intended for FL and design a new defense strategy that filters out malicious smashed data to improve the robustness of SFL. We observe that the adoption of properly chosen defense mechanisms is beneficial in decreasing the security risks of SFL, but entirely eliminating the impacts of poisoning attacks in SFL is still challenging.",

    "abstract": "A new digital technique to detect and suppress intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) attacks on smart speakers (SSs) without disrupting their nominal operation during the attack is proposed in this article. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by experiments on a proof-of-concept SS prototype equipped with an artificial intelligence speech recognition algorithm. Thanks to the proposed suppression technique, the power of malicious signal in the audio band is suppressed by 19 dB, thus effectively preventing the execution of malicious commands in more than 99.6% of the cases under IEMI attacks of up to 5 dBm injected RF power in 10â100 MHz bandwidth. Under the same test conditions, the proposed detection technique, operating independently from the suppression method, makes it possible to successfully identify IEMI attacks in more than 99.8% of the cases. Experimental results also show the proper recognition of nominal commands while IEMI attacks are performed.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating automatic style extraction and transfer from existing well-designed graph visualizations can significantly alleviate the designer's workload. There are many types of graph visualizations. In this paper, our work focuses on node-link diagrams. We present a novel approach to streamline the design process of graph visualizations by automatically extracting visual styles from well-designed examples and applying them to other graphs. Our formative study identifies the key styles that designers consider when crafting visualizations, categorizing them into global and local styles. Leveraging deep learning techniques such as saliency detection models and multi-label classification models, we develop end-to-end pipelines for extracting both global and local styles. Global styles focus on aspects such as color scheme and layout, while local styles are concerned with the finer details of node and edge representations. Through a user study and evaluation experiment, we demonstrate the efficacy and time-saving benefits of our method, highlighting its potential to enhance the graph visualization design process.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and distributed sensors into aerial-terrestrial networks (ATNs) improves the ability to monitor remote and challenging environments. However, in such harsh environments, the UAV must return to the base station multiple times to be recharged to ensure that all sensors can be accessed. Neglecting the energy consumption associated with the backhaul recharging path would lead to a decrease in task efficiency and an increase in overall energy consumption. To address the challenge, this paper formulates a UAV back-haul trajectory planning (UBTP) problem, aiming to optimize both the data collection and charging paths for UAVs. At the same time, a two-stage deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is developed to address the UBTP problem. The first stage of the proposed method determines the navigation sequence taking into account the energy consumption of the data collection and charging path. The subsequent stage refines the trajectory by considering the sensing ranges of the sensors. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides solutions that are more energy-efficient compared to benchmark methods, thereby enhancing the UAVâs ability to harvest data sustainably and effectively from distributed sensors in challenging environments.",

    "abstract": "There is increasingly interest in developing embedded machine learning hardware as it can offer better performance in terms of privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. Gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) represent a strong candidate as they employ less complex logic, but their efficient implementation in field programmable gate array (FPGA) needs to be explored in detail. In this paper, we propose sophisticated quantisation approaches to balance the dual goals of efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce quantisation-aware training of GBDT for integer-only and binary arithmetic. Results are presented for implementations on a Zynq UltraScale\n+\nMPSoC FPGA with the best design using only 170 Look-up Tables and 233 flip-flops at a clock speed of 724 MHz. Implementations focused on network intrusion detection and jet substructure classification for large-scale physics experiments are explored. An order of magnitude less FPGA resources are used whilst offering extremely high throughput rate and maintaining accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/malsharari/QATGBDT.",

    "abstract": "Technological advancements have enabled electricity utilities to experiment with various artificially intelligent approaches to minimize the challenges posed by end-user demand volatility. Although the introduction of such techniques has made operating the system easier, it has also made the internal process difficult to interpret. It makes difficult for the operator to solve any issues raised due to any fault in the model design. Designing demand response strategies that are simple to comprehend is crucial for this reason. Hence, the consumer demand response model will exhibit the much-needed system behavior of transparency, trust, and objectivity. The fundamental goal of this research is to introduce an explainable artificially intelligent (XAI) demand response (DR) model based on machine learning (ML) that assures supply-demand equilibrium across the power system network. The proposed methodology combines an integrated load forecasting approach with a DR model based on Jaya optimization. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the DR program is illustrated in relation to the accuracy of the load forecasting model. The operation of this integrated ML-based technique was shown using an XAI-based model architecture. The proposed technique was modelled and tested in the MATLAB interface utilizing a database of 24 end-user energy usage.",

    "abstract": "Performance improvements obtained by recent principled approaches for pulse rate (PR) estimation have typically been achieved by adding or modifying certain modules within a reconfigurable system. Yet, evaluations are usually performed only at the system level. To better understand each module's contribution and facilitate future research in explainable learning and artificial intelligence for physiological monitoring, this paper conducts a comparative study of video-based, principled PR tracking algorithms, with a particular focus on challenging fitness scenarios. A review of the progress achieved over the last decade and a half in this field is utilized to construct the major processing modules of a reconfigurable remote pulse rate sensing system. Experiments are conducted on two challenging datasetsâan internal collection of 25 videos of two Asian males exercising on stationary-bike, elliptical, and treadmill machines and 34 videos from a public ECG fitness database of 14 men and 3 women exercising on elliptical and stationary-bike machines. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Pearson's correlation coefficient, error count ratio, error rate, and root mean squared error are used for performance evaluation. The top-performing configuration produces respective values of $-$ 0.8 dB, 0.86, 9%, 1.7%, and 3.3 beats per minute (bpm) for the internal dataset and 1.3 dB, 0.77, 28.6%, 6.0%, and 8.1 bpm for the ECG Fitness dataset, achieving significant improvements over alternative configurations. Our results indicate a synergistic effect between pulse color mapping and adaptive motion filtering, as well as the importance of a robust frequency tracking algorithm for PR estimation in low SNR settings.",

    "abstract": "In the field of music generation using algorithms, processing time-series data has consistently been a complex task. To improve music generation with long sequences, insightful-unit-conditional variational autoencoder is proposed, which can enhance unit-conditional variational autoencoders with an improved attention mechanism. This model integrates TransformerXLs recurrent mechanism and relative positional encoding with measure-level granularity. For practical applications, a scheme is addressed that uses optical flow to extract motion features from video frames, quantifying motion rate and intensity. Furthermore, a dynamic correlation method is proposed to align video motion features with musical rhythm, guiding the model to generate melodies that match the videos rhythm.",

    "abstract": "The upcoming 6G networks aim for fully automated, intelligent network functionalities and services. Therefore, ML is essential for these networks. Given stringent privacy regulations, future network architectures should use privacy-preserved ML for their applications and services. FL is expected to play an important role as a popular approach for distributed ML, as it protects privacy by design. However, many practical challenges exist before FL can be fully utilized as a key technology for these future networks. We consider the vision of a 6G layered architecture to evaluate the applicability of FL-based distributed intelligence. In this paper, we highlight the benefits of using FL for 6G and the main challenges and issues involved. We also discuss the existing solutions and the possible future directions that should be taken toward more robust and trustworthy FL for future networks.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative approach to realize a mixer-first receiver architecture, which comprises an N-path differential architecture realized through a passive-switching network, followed by a novel self-biased active inductor-based filter. This combination allows the circuit to achieve high pass-band to stop-band attenuation and the capability to adjust and achieve the desired bandwidth and occupy less area on-chip while maintaining a high selectivity level and rejecting unwanted signals. A noise-cancelling amplifier is placed between the N-path and active inductor-based low-pass elliptic filter to reduce the noise figure of the receiver. In addition to the filter, a novel self-biased baseband amplifier with a wide bandwidth is realized, followed by a buffer to derive a 50 ohms load. The LO signal generation for the proposed receiver is obtained by implementing a passive balun circuit that operates over a wideband followed by an on-chip polyphase filter and buffer. The proof of concept is validated by implementing a designed receiver with an N-path differential architecture followed by a novel active inductor-based low-pass third-order elliptic filter, which occupies less area and achieves high selectivity compared to a passive inductor based filter on 180-nm CMOS technology. The receiver operates within the frequency range of 16-20 GHz and achieves an instantaneous single sideband (SSB) bandwidth of 160 MHz. The proposed filter achieves a pass-band to stop-band attenuation of 47 dB with a Q of 140. Additionally, the receiver exhibits an in-band compression point at -5 dBm and in-band IIP3 of 4â6 dBm with out-of-band signal linearity greater than 10 dBm.",

    "abstract": "Chest CT scans play an important role in diagnosing abnormalities associated with the lungs, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, and, more recently, COVID-19. However, because conventional normal-dose chest CT scans require a much larger amount of radiation than x-rays, practitioners seek to replace conventional CT with low-dose CT (LDCT). LDCT often generates a low-quality CT image that poses noise and, in turn, negatively affects the accuracy of diagnosis. Therefore, in the context of COVID-19, due to the large number of affected populations, efficient image-denoising techniques are needed for LDCT images. Here, we present a deep learning (DL) model that combines two neural networks to enhance the quality of low-dose chest CT images. The DL model leverages a previously developed DenseNet and Deconvolution-based Network (DDNet) for feature extraction and extends it with a pre-trained VGG network inside the loss function to suppress noise. Outputs from selected multiple levels in the VGG network (ML-VGG) are leveraged for the loss calculation. We tested our DDNet with ML-VGG loss using several sources of CT images and compared its performance to DDNet without VGG loss as well as DDNet with an empirically selected single-level VGG loss (DDNet-SL-VGG) and other state-of-the-art DL models. Our results show that DDNet combined with ML-VGG (DDNet-ML-VGG) achieves state-of-the-art denoising capabilities and improves the perceptual and quantitative image quality of chest CT images. Thus, DDNet with multi-level VGG loss could potentially be used as a post-acquisition image enhancement tool for medical professionals to diagnose and monitor chest diseases with higher accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which offloads computation-intensive tasks to mobile fog nodes for real-time and low-latency services. In the forthcoming era of low-altitude economy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being integrated as task-carrying entities into the ITS, and the novel low-altitude VFC is witnessing new challenges, introduced by dynamic UAV missions, high mobility, and privacy concerns. To preserve the offloading privacy and enhance the offloading performance in the dynamic low-altitude VFC, in this paper, we facilitate the learning-based methods and propose a hierarchical federated reinforcement learning framework. The framework consists of two levels: the local level provides Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models for task vehicles and UAVs, and the cross-regional contextual level for coordinating the local experiences. At the local DRL level, we design an Attention-enhanced Federated Proximal Policy Optimization (AFedPPO) algorithm to enable decentralized training and execution (DTDE) for task offloading, which is privacy-preserving, effective, and scalable for the low-altitude VFC systems. At the cross-regional level, we introduce a contextual clustering and personalized (CCP) federated learning (FL) mechanism, which adaptively aggregates the local experiences according to the regional features. Extensive simulation results validate an average 35% improvement of the proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art FL schemes, and in some cases, even outperform the centralized training (CTDE) baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to theoretically discuss how contextual information can enhance the performance of the DRL-based offloading strategy under FL settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Knowledge Management (KM), highlighting how AI reshapes traditional KM practices in organizations. It starts by reviewing historical KM frameworks, particularly the SECI model, which emphasizes the transformation between tacit and explicit knowledge. It differentiates generative AI from earlier AI models in terms of output nature, learning adaptability, and application scope. The study explores AI's potential to improve KM processes, focusing on how it influences social interactions, facilitates knowledge community development, and fosters collaborative intelligence by leveraging the strengths of both AI and human capabilities. AI's transformative role in KM includes enhancing knowledge creation, storage, and dissemination, accelerating processes like externalization and combination in the SECI model. However, the paper notes AI's current limitations in managing tacit knowledge and human-centric decision-making. The research underscores AI's capacity to streamline KM processes, improve efficiency, and unlock new opportunities for organizations. By integrating AI tools with human expertise, organizations can enhance their ability to manage, share, and apply knowledge, setting the stage for innovative approaches to knowledge-driven growth and decision-making in diverse contexts.",

    "abstract": "Considering the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, especially the closeness of their function to the human brain in terms of perception and understanding of sensory and emotional concepts, it can be concluded that this concept is cognitively evolving toward an artificial mind (AM). This article introduces the concept of AM as a more accurate interpretation of the future of AI. It explores the distinction between intelligence and mind, highlighting the holistic nature of the mind, which includes cognitive, psychological, and emotional dimensions. Various types of intelligence, from rational to emotional, are categorized to emphasize their role in shaping human abilities. The study evaluates the human mind, focusing on cognitive functions, logical thinking, emotional understanding, learning, and creativity. It encourages AI systems to understand contextual, emotional, and subjective aspects and aligns AI with human intelligence through advanced perception and emotional capabilities. The shift from AI to AM has significant implications, transforming work, education, and human-machine collaboration, and promises a future where AI systems integrate advanced perceptual and emotional functions. This narrative guides the conversation around AI terminology, emphasizing the convergence of artificial and human intelligence and acknowledging the social implications. Therefore, the term âartificial mindâ appears as a more appropriate term than âartificial intelligenceâ, symbolizing the transformative technological change and its multifaceted impact on society.",

    "abstract": "Despite their increasing popularity, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) projects often fail to deliver expected outcomes, frequently ending prematurely or not being deployed. Beyond data and model requirements, AI/ML projects necessitate cross-domain performance, business analysis, effective stakeholder and team management, risk and quality management, and a tailored development approach. These factors underline the need for a systemic project management (PM) approach that addresses the interconnections among business, organizational, team, and PM factors, rather than focusing on isolated AI/ML achievements. Current PM methods like CRISP-DM, TDSP, Scrum, and Kanban may not adequately meet these challenges. Therefore, a systemic PM framework is essential for AI/ML project success, particularly in critical areas such as healthcare. This study argues for a change toward a principle-based, holistic, and systemic PM approach tailored to the performance domains of AI/ML projects. It explores the adoption of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK V7) for an ML project at Baskent University Hospital Ankara (BUHA). By combining Systems Engineering and Soft Systems Methodology with a survey on performance domains, we enhance PMBOK V7's applicability to AI/ML, proposing solutions that include conceptual and process models. Findings indicate PMBOK V7 meets AI/ML project requirements but needs adaptations for ML processes.",

    "abstract": "During the propagation of seismic waves in the Earth, the influence of Earth absorption leads to energy attenuation and phase distortion. Traditional seismic acoustic impedance (AI) inversion typically utilizes a constant wavelet to construct a wavelet library for AI inversion, resulting in outcomes that struggle to effectively portray the spatial variation characteristics of underground reservoirs. While using an inverse Q filter for energy compensation before AI inversion can enhance precision, accurately extracting the Q factor before the inverse Q filter is complex. Moreover, the inverse Q filter often amplifies noise interference, impacting the accuracy of the inversion. Therefore, we propose an alternating iterative synchronous inversion method for AI and the quality factor. Compared with the conventional method, the impedance information and attenuation parameters of seismic data can be obtained directly, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of inversion. The method can be divided into two steps. Firstly, we construct the L 1-2 -norm regularization of the AI inversion objective function, which is solved using the difference of convex algorithm (DCA) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Subsequently, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to solve the nonstationary forward equation, with the fitting of the centroid frequency of seismic data and synthetic seismic records. Through continuous iteration of AI and the quality factor until the error is below the specified threshold or reaches the designated number of iterations, stable AI and average Q factors are obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate the reliability of the proposed method, showcasing higher accuracy compared to stable wavelet inversion and constant Q inversion. Real data applications validate the methodâs effectiveness, providing more dependable results for reservoir fluid identification. The obtained average Q factors can be employed for seismic d...",

    "abstract": "Considering both audio and visual modalities is helpful for understanding a video. In the face of harsh environmental interference or signal packet loss, automatically compensating for audio and vision is a challenging task. We propose a dynamic cross-modal visual-audio mutual generation model (VAMG), which includes audio to visual conversion, visual to audio conversion, audio self-generation, and visual self-generation. VAMG jointly optimizes modal reconstruction and adversarial constraints, effectively solving the problems of structural alignment and signal compensation in incomplete videos. We conducted an instrument-oriented and pose-oriented cross-modal audio-visual mutual generation experiment on the sub-University of Rochester Musical Performance dataset to verify the effectiveness of the model.",

    "abstract": "There has been rapid progress recently on 3D human rendering, including novel view synthesis and pose animation, based on the advances of neural radiance fields (NeRF). However, most existing methods focus on person-specific training and their training typically requires multi-view videos. This paper deals with a new challenging task â rendering novel views and novel poses for a person unseen in training, using only multiview still images as input without videos. For this task, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective method to train a generalizable NeRF with multiview images as conditional input. The key ingredient is a dedicated representation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme. Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human and easily generalize to different people. Volume deformation is used to connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D human model fitted on the input images to derive the deformation, which works quite well in practice when combined with our canonical NeRF. The experiments on both real and synthetic data with the novel view synthesis and pose animation tasks collectively demonstrate the efficacy of our method.",

    "abstract": "Real-world machine learning systems need to analyze test data that may differ from training data. In K-way classification, this is crisply formulated as open-set recognition, core to which is the ability to discriminate open-set data outside the K closed-set classes. Two conceptually elegant ideas for open-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed binary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2) unsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN, using its discriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former generalizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training outliers, which are unlikely to exhaustively span the open-world. The latter does not work well, presumably due to the unstable training of GANs. Motivated by the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each approach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that a carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already achieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real open training examples with adversarially synthesized âfakeâ data. Third and most importantly, we build the discriminator over the features computed by the closed-world K-way networks. This allows OpenGAN to be implemented via a lightweight discriminator head built on top of an existing K-way network. Extensive experiments show that OpenGAN significantly outperforms prior open-set methods.",

    "abstract": "A thorough understanding of cell-line drug response mechanisms is crucial for drug development, repurposing, and resistance reversal. While targeted anticancer therapies have shown promise, not all cancers have well-established biomarkers to stratify drug response. Single-gene associations only explain a small fraction of the observed drug sensitivity, so a more comprehensive method is needed. However, while deep learning models have shown promise in predicting drug response in cell lines, they still face significant challenges when it comes to their application in clinical applications. Therefore, this study proposed a new strategy called DD-Response for cell-line drug response prediction. First, a limitation of narrow modeling horizons was overcome to expand the model training domain by integrating multiple datasets through source-specific label binarization. Second, a modified representation based on a two-dimensional structurized gridding map (SGM) was developed for cell lines & drugs, avoiding feature correlation neglect and potential information loss. Third, a dual-branch, multi-channel convolutional neural network-based model for pairwise response prediction was constructed, enabling accurate outcomes and improved exploration of underlying mechanisms. As a result, the DD-Response demonstrated superior performance, captured cell-line characteristic variations, and provided insights into key factors impacting cell-line drug response. In addition, DD-Response exhibited scalability in predicting clinical patient responses to drug therapy. Overall, because of DD-response's excellent ability to predict drug response and capture key molecules behind them, DD-response is expected to greatly facilitate drug discovery, repurposing, resistance reversal, and therapeutic optimization.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a prevalent condition where fear of movement and pain interfere with everyday functioning. Yet, there is no open body movement dataset for people with chronic pain in everyday settings. Our EmoPain@Home dataset addresses this with capture from 18 people with and without chronic pain in their homes, while they performed their routine activities. The data includes labels for pain, worry, and movement confidence continuously recorded for activity instances for the people with chronic pain. We explored baseline two-level pain detection based on this dataset and obtained 0.62 mean F1 score. However, extension of the dataset led to deterioration in performance confirming high variability in pain expressions for real world settings. We investigated baseline activity recognition for this setting as a first step in exploring the use of the activity label as contextual information for improving pain level classification performance. We obtained mean F1 score of 0.43 for 9 activity types, highlighting its feasibility. Further exploration, however, showed that data from healthy people cannot be easily leveraged for improving performance because worry and low confidence alter activity strategies for people with chronic pain. Our dataset and findings lay critical groundwork for automatic assessment of pain experience and behaviour in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Most existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) to extract coarse class-specific localization maps using image-level labels. Prior works have commonly used an off-line heuristic thresholding process that combines the CAM maps with off-the-shelf saliency maps produced by a general pretrained saliency model to produce more accurate pseudo-segmentation labels. We propose AuxSegNet $+$ , a weakly supervised auxiliary learning framework to explore the rich information from these saliency maps and the significant intertask correlation between saliency detection and semantic segmentation. In the proposed AuxSegNet $+$ , saliency detection and multilabel image classification are used as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of semantic segmentation with only image-level ground-truth labels. We also propose a cross-task affinity learning mechanism to learn pixel-level affinities from the saliency and segmentation feature maps. In particular, we propose a cross-task dual-affinity learning module to learn both pairwise and unary affinities, which are used to enhance the task-specific features and predictions by aggregating both query-dependent and query-independent global context for both saliency detection and semantic segmentation. The learned cross-task pairwise affinity can also be used to refine and propagate CAM maps to provide better pseudo labels for both tasks. Iterative improvement of segmentation performance is enabled by cross-task affinity learning and pseudo-label updating. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with new state-of-the-art WSSS results on the challenging PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a significant role by collecting and analyzing real-time data on consumer behavior, product availability, and other environmental factors, thus enhancing e-commerce operations. Researchers in the domain of consumer electronics are working actively to increase the sustainability of WSNs and decrease their ecological footprint by developing energy-efficient algorithms, data compression techniques, and sensor designs. These advancements are directed toward optimizing energy consumption and minimizing environmental consequences while ensuring the smooth functionality of IoT applications. Organizations are emphasizing the need for collaboration between designers, business organizations, developers, and regulatory authorities to implement eco-friendly industrial laws to enhance the effectiveness of the e-commerce industry. Decision-making in the e-commerce sector is complicated by information overload, subjectivity of preferences, trust issues, product variety, lack of personalized assistance, return and exchange concerns, dynamic pricing and discounts, limited sensory experience, and complex decision-making processes. To address these challenges, an entropy-based multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to assist personalization in e-commerce and improve user interfaces, recommendation systems, product information transparency, and consumer trust. The utilization of the MCDM technique facilitates the customization of electronic commerce platforms, whereby affordable products can be identified and retrieved according to individual user preferences. The study investigates the impact of electronic gadgets and energy-efficient WSNs on inventory management, customer preferences, and online shopping sustainability, highlighting the intricate relationship between data privacy, energy efficiency, and governance. The proposed method is compared to other state-of-the-art methodolo...",

    "abstract": "The identification of cortical sulci is key for understanding functional and structural development of the cortex. While large, consistent sulci (or primary/secondary sulci) receive significant attention in most studies, the exploration of smaller and more variable sulci (or putative tertiary sulci) remains relatively under-investigated. Despite its importance, automatic labeling of cortical sulci is challenging due to (1) the presence of substantial anatomical variability, (2) the relatively small size of the regions of interest (ROIs) compared to unlabeled regions, and (3) the scarcity of annotated labels. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework using a spherical convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the proposed method learns to effectively warp geometric features in a direction that facilitates the labeling of sulci while mitigating the impact of anatomical variability. Moreover, we introduce a guided-attention mechanism that takes into account the extent of deformation induced by the learned warping. This extracts discriminative features that emphasize sulcal ROIs, while suppressing irrelevant information of unlabeled regions. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method on 8 sulci of the posterior medial cortex. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in the putative tertiary sulci.

    "abstract": "3D point cloud completion is very challenging because it relies on accurately understanding the complex 3D shapes (e.g., high-curvature, concave/convex, and hollowed-out 3D shapes) and the unknown & diverse patterns of the partially available point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, i.e., Point-block Carving (PC), for completing the complex 3D point cloud completion. Given the partial point cloud as the guidance, we carve a 3D block that contains the uniformly distributed 3D points, yielding the entire point cloud. We propose a new network architecture to achieve PC, i.e., CarveNet. This network conducts the exclusive convolution on each block point, where the convolutional kernels are trained on the 3D shape data. CarveNet determines which point should be carved to recover the complete shapes' details effectively. Furthermore, we propose a sensor-aware method for data augmentation, i.e., SensorAug, for training CarveNet on richer patterns of partial point clouds, thus enhancing the completion power of the network. The extensive evaluations on the ShapeNet, ShapNet-55/34 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the generality of our approach on the partial point clouds with diverse patterns. On these datasets, CarveNet successfully outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Transfer multiobjective optimization promises sample-efficient discovery of near Pareto-optimal solutions to a target task by utilizing experiential priors from related source tasks. In this paper, we show that in domains where evaluation data is at a premium, e.g., in scientific and engineering disciplines involving time-consuming computer simulations or complex real-world experimentation, knowledge transfer through surrogate models can be pivotal in saving sample evaluation costs. While state-of-the-art algorithms (without transfer) typically assume budgets in the order of only a few hundred evaluations, we seek to explore how far we can get on even tighter budgets. The uniqueness of our proposed Expensive Transfer Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimizer (ExTrEMO) is that it can maximally utilize external information from hundreds of source datasets, including those that may be negatively correlated with the target task. This is achieved by melding evolutionary search with factorized transfer Gaussian process surrogates, capturing varied source-target correlations in potentially decentralized computation environments. We provide a regret bound analysis for ExTrEMO that translates to a theoretical proof of increasingly faster convergence as a result of multi-source transfers. The theory is experimentally verified on benchmark functions and toward accelerated design of biomedical microdevices. We release our code at https://github.com/LiuJ-2023/ExTrEMO.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a composite adaptive control architecture using dual adaptation scheme for dynamical systems comprising time-varying uncertain parameters. While majority of the adaptive control schemes in literature address the case of constant parameters, recent research has conceptualized improved adaptive control techniques for time-varying systems with rigorous stability proofs. The proposed work is an effort towards a similar direction, where a novel dual adaptation mechanism is introduced to efficiently tackle the time-varying nature of the parameters. Projection and $\\sigma$ -modification algorithms are strategically combined using congelation of variables to claim a global result for the tracking error space. While the classical adaptive systems demand a restrictive condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for accurate parameter estimation, the proposed work relies on a milder condition, called initial excitation (IE) for the same. A rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out to establish boundedness of the closed-loop system with a tighter ultimate bound compared to existing results. Further it is analytically shown that the proposed work can recover the performance of previously designed IE-based adaptive controller in case of time invariant systems.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental models for cohesive subgraph mining in network analysis is that which involves the use of cliques. In bipartite graph analysis, the detection of maximal balanced bicliques (MBB) is an important problem with numerous applications, including VLSI design, protein interactions, and social networks. However, MBB detection is difficult, complex, and time-consuming. In the current paper, to address these disadvantages, we propose a new algorithm for detecting MBB using formal concept analysis (FCA) on bipartite graphs. We applied an algorithm to compute formal concepts from the formal context, which is an alternative way of representing a bipartite graph.We proved that the MBB problem is equivalent to the semi-equiconcept enumeration problem in the formal context. Therefore, the semi-equiconcept mining algorithm was applied to theMBB enumeration problem. However, since the existing FCA algorithm cannot be directly applied to mine all MBBs, the FCA algorithm was modified in its entirety. Thorough asymptotic analysis was performed on the proposed algorithm. Experiments were also conducted on various real-world bipartite graphs to which the proposed algorithm was applied, and our results were found to be significantly better than those obtained by the preexisting algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2) fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1) objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision, (2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology in both terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) due to its ability to manipulate wireless environments for better connectivity. Significant studies have been focused on conventional RIS with diagonal phase response matrices. This simple RIS architecture, though less expensive, has limited flexibility in engineering the wireless channels. As the latest member of RIS technology, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has recently been proposed in terrestrial setups. Due to the interconnected phase response elements (PREs), BD-RIS significantly enhances the control over the wireless environment. This work proposes the potential and challenges of BD-RIS in NTNs. We begin with the motivation and recent advances in BD-RIS. Subsequently, we discuss the fundamentals of BD-RIS and NTNs. We then outline the application of BD-RIS in NTNs, followed by a case study on BD-RIS enabled non-orthogonal multiple access low earth orbit satellite communication. Finally, we highlight challenges and research directions with concluding remarks.",

    "abstract": "Mobile video applications today have attracted significant attention. Deep learning model (e.g., deep neural network, DNN) compression is widely used to enable on-device inference for facilitating robust and private mobile video applications. The compressed DNN, however, is vulnerable to the agnostic data drift of the live video captured from the dynamically changing mobile scenarios. To combat the data drift, mobile ends rely on edge servers to continuously evolve and re-compress the DNN with freshly collected data. We design a framework, AdaEvo, that efficiently supports the resource-limited edge server handling mobile DNN evolution tasks from multiple mobile ends. The key goal of AdaEvo is to maximize the average quality of experience (QoE), i.e., the proportion of high-quality DNN service time to the entire life cycle, for all mobile ends. Specifically, it estimates the DNN accuracy drops at the mobile end without labels and performs a dedicated video frame sampling strategy to control the size of retraining data. In addition, it balances the limited computing and memory resources on the edge server and the competition between asynchronous tasks initiated by different mobile users. With an extensive evaluation of real-world videos from mobile scenarios and across four diverse mobile tasks, experimental results show that AdaEvo enables up to 34% accuracy improvement and 32% average QoE improvement.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental prerequisite for embodied agents to make intelligent decisions lies in autonomous cognition. Typically, agents optimize decision-making by leveraging extensive spatiotemporal information from episodic memory. Concurrently, they utilize long-term experience for task reasoning and foster conscious behavioral tendencies. However, due to the significant disparities in the heterogeneous modalities of these two cognitive abilities, existing literature falls short in designing effective coupling mechanisms, thus failing to endow robots with comprehensive intelligence. This article introduces a navigation framework, the hierarchical topology-semantic cognitive navigation (HTSCN), which seamlessly integrates both memory and reasoning abilities within a singular end-to-end system. Specifically, we represent memory and reasoning abilities with a topological map and a semantic relation graph, respectively, within a unified dual-layer graph structure. Additionally, we incorporate a neural-based cognition extraction process to capture cross-modal relationships between hierarchical graphs. HTSCN forges a link between two different cognitive modalities, thus further enhancing decision-making performance and the overall level of intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate that in comparison to existing cognitive structures, HTSCN significantly enhances the performance and path efficiency of image-goal navigation. Visualization and interpretability experiments further corroborate the promoting role of memory, reasoning, as well as their online learned relationships, on intelligent behavioral patterns. Furthermore, we deploy HTSCN in real-world scenarios to further verify its feasibility and adaptability.",

    "abstract": "Dense SLAM based on monocular cameras does indeed have immense application value in the field of AR/VR, especially when it is performed on a mobile device. In this paper, we propose a novel method that integrates a light-weight depth completion network into a sparse SLAM system using a multi-basis depth representation, so that dense mapping can be performed online even on a mobile phone. Specifically, we present a specifically optimized multi-basis depth completion network, called BBC-Net, tailored to the characteristics of traditional sparse SLAM systems. BBC-Net can predict multiple balanced bases and a confidence map from a monocular image with sparse points generated by off-the-shelf keypoint-based SLAM systems. The final depth is a linear combination of predicted depth bases that can be easily optimized by tuning the corresponding weights. To seamlessly incorporate the weights into traditional SLAM optimization and ensure efficiency and robustness, we design a set of depth weight factors, which makes our network a versatile plug-in module, facilitating easy integration into various existing sparse SLAM systems and significantly enhancing global depth consistency through bundle adjustment. To verify the portability of our method, we integrate BBC-Net into two representative SLAM systems. The experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method achieves better performance in monocular dense mapping than the state-of-the-art methods. We provide an online demo running on a mobile phone, which verifies the efficiency and mapping quality of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the widespread adoption of the IoT networks in numerous digital applications. To counter physical threats in these systems, automatic modulation classification (AMC) has emerged as an effective approach for identifying the modulation format of signals in noisy environments. However, identifying those threats can be particularly challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data, which is a common issue in various IoT applications, such as anomaly detection for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and intrusion detection in the IoT networks. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to grasp the concepts of new classes using only a limited number of labeled samples. However, prevalent FSL techniques are primarily tailored for tasks in the computer vision domain and are not suitable for the wireless signal domain. Instead of designing a new FSL model, this work suggests a novel approach that enhances wireless signals to be more efficiently processed by the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSL models. We present the semantic-consistent signal pretransformation (ScSP), a parameterized transformation architecture that ensures signals with identical semantics exhibit similar representations. ScSP is designed to integrate seamlessly with various SOTA FSL models for signal modulation recognition and supports commonly used deep learning backbones. Our evaluation indicates that ScSP boosts the performance of numerous SOTA FSL models, while preserving flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Graph classification is a critical task in numerous multimedia applications, where graphs are employed to represent diverse types of multimedia data, including images, videos, and social networks. Nevertheless, in the real world, labeled graph data are always limited or scarce. To address this issue, we focus on the semi-supervised graph classification task, which involves both supervised and unsupervised models learning from labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast to recent approaches that transfer the entire knowledge from the unsupervised model to the supervised one, we argue that an effective transfer should only retain the relevant semantics that align well with the supervised task. We introduce a novel framework termed in this article, which learns disentangled representation for semi-supervised graph classification. Specifically, a disentangled graph encoder is proposed to generate factorwise graph representations for both supervised and unsupervised models. Then, we train two models via supervised objective and mutual information (MI)-based constraints, respectively. To ensure the meaningful transfer of knowledge from the unsupervised encoder to the supervised one, we further define an MI-based disentangled consistency regularization between two models and identify the corresponding rationale that aligns well with the current graph classification task. Experiments conducted on various publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our .",

    "abstract": "3D medical image segmentation methods have been successful, but their dependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage that needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) solves this issue by training models with a large unlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are based on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model responses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These perturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly consistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the spatial input contexts instead of the foreground objects. In this paper, we introduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a consistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying their spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns from foreground objects. Furthermore, we propose a new Confident Regional Cross entropy (CRC) loss, which improves training convergence and keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. Our method yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for several 3D data benchmarks, such as the Left Atrium (LA), Pancreas-CT (Pancreas), and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS19). Our method also attains best results on a 2D-slice benchmark, namely the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC), further demonstrating its effectiveness. Our code, training logs and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yyliu01/ TraCoCo.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models have indeed made a profound impact on various fields, emerging as pivotal components that significantly shape the capabilities of intelligent systems. In the context of intelligent vehicles, leveraging the power of foundation models has proven to be transformative, offering notable advancements in visual understanding. Equipped with multi-modal and multi-task learning capabilities, multi-modal multi-task visual understanding foundation models (MM-VUFMs) effectively process and fuse data from diverse modalities and simultaneously handle various driving-related tasks with powerful adaptability, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the surrounding scene. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of MM-VUFMs specifically designed for road scenes. Our objective is not only to provide a comprehensive overview of common practices, referring to task-specific models, unified multi-modal models, unified multi-task models, and foundation model prompting techniques, but also to highlight their advanced capabilities in diverse learning paradigms. These paradigms include open-world understanding, efficient transfer for road scenes, continual learning, interactive and generative capability. Moreover, we provide insights into key challenges and future trends, such as closed-loop driving systems, interpretability, low-resource conditions, embodied driving agents, and world models. To facilitate researchers in staying abreast of the latest developments in MM-VUFMs for road scenes, we have established a continuously updated repository at https://github.com/rolsheng/MM-VUFM4DS .",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a physics-based compact model for Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) MRAM, calibrated against fabricated devices. Our model addresses inherent stochasticity, offering a robust tool for the design and simulation of VCMA MRAM peripheral circuits. Achieving a tenfold increase in simulation speed compared to existing stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (sLLGS) based models (10Ã to 100Ã), and overcoming accuracy problems related to VCMA macro-spin sLLGS simulations, our approach enables efficient exploration of MRAM based circuits. The model efficiency and accuracy are demonstrated through a practical use case.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for medical image analysis easily suffer from distribution shifts caused by dataset artifact bias, camera variations, differences in the imaging station, etc., leading to unreliable diagnoses in real-world clinical settings. Domain generalization (DG) methods, which aim to train models on multiple domains to perform well on unseen domains, offer a promising direction to solve the problem. However, existing DG methods assume domain labels of each image are available and accurate, which is typically feasible for only a limited number of medical datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a unified DG framework for medical image classification without relying on domain labels, called Prompt-driven Latent Domain Generalization (PLDG). PLDG consists of unsupervised domain discovery and prompt learning. This framework first discovers pseudo domain labels by clustering the bias-associated style features, then leverages collaborative domain prompts to guide a Vision Transformer to learn knowledge from discovered diverse domains. To facilitate cross-domain knowledge learning between different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables knowledge sharing between domain prompts and a shared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally employed for more flexible decision margins and mitigates the risk of incorrect domain assignments. Extensive experiments on three medical image classification tasks and one debiasing task demonstrate that our method can achieve comparable or even superior performance than conventional DG algorithms without relying on domain labels. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/PLDG/tree/main.",

    "abstract": "Target search in unknown environments places high demands not only on an autonomous vehicle's ability to perceive and interpret target cues, but also on its conscious of collecting these cues by active exploration. While existing navigation methods have successfully built target-driven policies by maintaining memory of explored areas, there has been a lack of focus on facilitating target-aware exploration-the informative frontier information at unexplored yet visible areas is often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce a novel topology-based memory structure, Frontier-enhanced Topological Memory (FTM), and a Hierarchical Topology Encoding and Extraction (HTEE) module, fostering the autonomous vehicle's awareness of both environmental exploration and target approach. Specifically, FTM innovatively incorporates informative ghost nodes on traditional topological map to represent unexplored yet visible regions. We leverage an online-trained implicit scene representation to estimate the positions and generate features of these ghost nodes. The HTEE then employs implicit graph convolutions and attention mechanisms to extract cognitive information from FTM, taking into account the hierarchical memory structure, target cues, and current state. Our design bolsters cognitive navigation decisions. The experiments in the high-fidelity environments, including performance tests, visualizations, and interpretability experiments, validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the vehicle's exploratory behavior. The improved exploration awareness for target cue collection, in turn, enhances the success rate and path efficiency of target search. Furthermore, we demonstrate the adaptability of our algorithm in real-world physical environments.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot image classification (FSIC) is beneficial for a variety of real-world scenarios, aiming to construct a recognition system with limited training data. In this article, we extend the original FSIC task by incorporating defense against malicious adversarial examples. This can be an arduous challenge because numerous deep learning-based approaches remain susceptible to adversarial examples, even when trained with ample amounts of data. Previous studies on this problem have predominantly concentrated on the meta-learning framework, which involves sampling numerous few-shot tasks during the training stage. In contrast, we propose a straightforward but effective baseline via learning robust and discriminative representations without tedious meta-task sampling, which can further be generalized to unforeseen adversarial FSIC tasks. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial-aware (AA) mechanism that exploits feature-level distinctions between the legitimate and the adversarial domains to provide supplementary supervision. Moreover, we design a novel adversarial reweighting training strategy to ameliorate the imbalance among adversarial examples. To further enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising discriminative features, we propose the cyclic feature purifier during the postprocessing projection, which can reduce the interference of unforeseen adversarial examples. Furthermore, our method can obtain robust feature embeddings that maintain superior transferability, even when facing cross-domain adversarial examples. Extensive experiments and systematic analyses demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness as well as natural performance among adversarially robust FSIC algorithms on three standard benchmarks by a substantial margin.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a task of leveraging deep neural networks to enhance the image illumination while keeping the image content unchanged. From the perspective of training data, existing methods complete the LLIE task driven by one of the following three data types: paired data, unpaired data and zero-reference data. Each type of these data-driven methods has its own advantages, e.g., zero-reference data-based methods have very low requirements on training data and can meet the human needs in many scenarios. In this paper, we leverage pure Gaussian noise to complete the LLIE task, which further reduces the requirements for training data in LLIE tasks and can be used as another alternative in practical use. Specifically, we propose Noise SElf-Regression (NoiSER) without access to any task-related data, simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with an instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image,\nN(0,\nÏ\n2\n)\nfor each pixel, as both input and output for each training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the trained network for predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the instance-normalization layer may naturally remediate the overall magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the\nN(0,\nÏ\n2\n)\nassumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known gray-world hypothesis [1] when the image size is big enough. Compared to current state-of-the-art LLIE methods with access to different task-related data, NoiSER is highly competitive in enhancement quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and inference cost. In addition, the experiments also demonstrate that NoiSER has great potential in overexposure suppression and joint processing with other restor...",

    "abstract": "Next generation of wireless brain-computer-interface (BCI) devices require dedicated neural signal processors (NSPs) to extract key neurological information while operating within given power consumption and transmission bandwidth limits. Spike detection and clustering are important signal processing steps in neurological research and clinical applications. Computational-friendly spike detection and feature extraction algorithms are first systematically evaluated in this work. The nonlinear energy operator (NEO) and the first-and-second-derivative (FSDE) together with the âperturbedâ K-mean clustering achieve the highest accuracy performance. An NSP ASIC is implemented in a channel-interleaved architecture and the folding ratio of 16 leads to the minimum power-and-area product. As the result, the NSP consumes 2-Î¼W power consumption and occupies 0.0057 mm2 for each channel in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The proposed system achieves the unsupervised spike classification accuracy of 92% and a data-rate reduction of 98.3%, showing the promise for realizing high-channel-count wireless BCIs.",

    "abstract": "Detecting leaks in natural gas pipelines using acoustic signals typically requires extensive prior knowledge and complex parameter designs, making it challenging to handle background noise and data distribution disparities simultaneously. This article proposes a dual-feature drift framework utilizing a nonparametric design approach for acoustic signal-based leak detection. This framework consists of two core technologies: first, feature backward normalization. Low-dimensional drift factors are designed based on transformed acoustic signals to exponentially normalize the time-periodic features of the signal feature matrix, thereby eliminating strong background noise. Second, constructing the feature drift layer within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Weighted parameters constrain a high-dimensional feature matrix, developing drift factors that perform exponential drift on each feature, thus enhancing gradient constraints and eliminating data distribution differences during model training. This framework achieves a fault identification accuracy of 95.46% for natural gas pipeline leaks, outperforming competing methods and representing a novel approach to intelligent pipeline leak detection.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of self-supervised 3D scene flow estimation from real large-scale raw point cloud sequences. The problem is crucial to various automotive tasks like trajectory prediction, object detection, and scene reconstruction. In the absence of ground truth scene flow labels, contemporary approaches concentrate on deducing and optimizing flow across sequential pairs of point clouds by incorporating structure-based regularization on flow and object rigidity. The rigid objects are estimated by a variety of 3D spatial clustering methods. While state-of-the-art methods successfully capture overall scene motion using the Neural Prior structure, they encounter challenges in discerning multi-object motions. We identified the structural constraints and the use of large and strict rigid clusters as the main pitfall of the current approaches, and we propose a novel clustering approach that allows for a combination of overlapping soft clusters and non-overlapping rigid clusters. Flow is then jointly estimated with progressively growing non-overlapping rigid clusters together with fixed-size overlapping soft clusters. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets with LiDAR point clouds, demonstrating superior performance over the self-supervised baselines and reaching new state-of-the-art results. Our method excels in resolving flow in complicated dynamic scenes with multiple independently moving objects close to each other, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users. Our codes are publicly available on https://github.com/ctu-vras/let-it-flow .",

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation substantially depends on memory mechanisms for enhancing path optimality. However, the dynamic nature of environments can cause inconsistencies between the stored scene memory and real-time perception, leading to potentially catastrophic navigation errors. Existing memory structures often fall short in addressing these challenges, as they typically only account for object-level dynamics and falter when faced with long-term alterations in environmental structure. To counter these constraints, this paper presents a learning-based framework designed to construct and maintain a geometric memory, thereby facilitating improved visuomotor navigation under structural dynamics. This proposed framework employs visual inputs to construct a geometric representation of the environment, and identifies structural changes by assessing the consistency between the established memory and instantaneous perception. To update the geometric memory efficiently, we introduce a memory updater grounded in a structure storage pool. Furthermore, a two-phase hierarchical planner is proposed to decompose navigation tasks and formulate smooth navigation strategies. Experimental results from photorealistic simulations underscore the efficacy of the proposed system in managing long-term dynamics and navigation control. The effectiveness of the proposed system is further corroborated through deployment and testing in real-world environments. Note to Practitioners âClassic geometry-based navigation methods hinge on the construction of a global map for spatial reasoning and optimized robot control. Within a learning-based pipeline, the dependence on memory information becomes critical for enabling robots to develop spatial and temporal awareness. While the maintenance of memory structures can significantly expand the field of the robotâs perception in time and space, discrepancies between historical memory and real-time perception in dynamic environments can lead to misguided dec...",

    "abstract": "The tremendous volume of data produced in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents an opportunity to utilize machine learning (ML) for developing several intelligent services. However, this abundance of data may also give rise to significant communication challenges when attempting to efficiently implement centralized learning (CL). To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to utilize Mahalanobis distance (MD) metric for sampling the data produced by the IoV. In the proposed approach, vehicles transmit their data to the nearby roadside infrastructure (RSI), which then samples valuable data from the available data using MD metric and relays it to the central server for necessary learning tasks. The sampling ratio for every RSI is determined to satisfy the estimated network delay required to transmit the data to the central server. The proposed method of transmitting only the valuable data, offers the huge potential to establish a communication-efficient learning network for the IoV. Initially, the learning performance of the proposed system is evaluated on synthetic data, followed by testing it on real data to demonstrate its effectiveness. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, alternative sampling approaches and several sampling ratios are taken into account and the performance is compared accordingly.",

Focusing on an SDT-TNT network with multiple clusters and potential unknown jammers, our approach addresses jammer detection through convolutional variational autoencoders (C-VAEs) within the FL framework. Leveraging the spectral correlation function (SCF) of the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation of received signals, our method extracts discriminating features for jammer detection in the absence of prior knowledge about the jammers. AAT-Fed excels at managing the unique characteristics of the tactical TNT network, considering its stochastic nature and the heterogeneity in data distribution between network cells, leading to enhanced jamming detection accuracy. Comparative simulation results demonstrate AAT-Fedâs superior performance over FL and non-FL approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in providing accurate jamming detection at a low jamming-to-noise ratio.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the guided Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm as an efficient data-driven method for iteratively tuning closed-loop controller parameters using a digital twin of the system. The digital twin is built using closed-loop data acquired during standard BO iterations, and activated when the uncertainty in the Gaussian Process model of the optimization objective on the real system is high. We define a controller tuning framework independent of the controller or the plant structure. Our proposed methodology is model-free, making it suitable for nonlinear and unmodelled plants with measurement noise. The objective function consists of performance metrics modeled by Gaussian processes. We utilize the available information in the closed-loop system to progressively maintain a digital twin that guides the optimizer, improving the data efficiency of our method. Switching the digital twin on and off is triggered by our data-driven criteria related to the digital twinâs uncertainty estimations in the BO tuning framework. Effectively, it replaces much of the exploration of the real system with exploration performed on the digital twin. We analyze the properties of our method in simulation and demonstrate its performance on two real closed-loop systems with different plant and controller structures. The experimental results show that our method requires fewer experiments on the physical plant than Bayesian optimization to find the optimal controller parameters. Note to Practitioners âIndustrial applications typically are difficult to model due to disturbances. Bayesian optimization is a data-efficient iterative tuning method for a black box system in which the performance can only be measured given the control parameters. Iterative measurements involve operational costs. We propose a guided Bayesian optimization method that uses all information flow in a system to define a simplified digital twin of the system using out-of-the-box methods. It is continuously...",

    "abstract": "Autonomous aerial vehicles can provide efficient and effective solutions for radio frequency (RF) source tracking and localizing problems with applications ranging from wildlife conservation to search and rescue operations. Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive â pseudo-bearingâ measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasksâdemo video at https://youtu.be/BmR1_ykCxj0 .",

    "abstract": "Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promising performance in general image segmentation tasks. However, their effectiveness is limited when applied to pathology images due to the inherent multi-scale structural complexity and staining heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we introduce SegAnyPath, a foundational model specifically designed for pathology image segmentation. SegAnyPath is trained on an extensive public pathology dataset comprising over 1.5 million images and 3.5 million masks. We propose a multi-scale proxy task to handle the diverse resolutions in pathology images, complementing the reconstruction objective in the supervised learning stage. To enhance segmentation performance across stain variations, we introduce a novel self-distillation scheme based on stain augmentations. Furthermore, we propose an innovative task-guided Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture in the decoder of SegAnyPath for efficient management of distinct pathology segmentation tasks, including cell, tissue, and tumor segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SegAnyPathâs zero-shot generalization capability, achieving a Dice score of 0.6797 across multiple datasets and organs while maintaining consistent performance across varying staining styles and resolutions. In comparison, the fine-tuned SAM achieves a Dice score of only 0.5258 on the same external test sets, indicating a substantial 29.27% improvement by SegAnyPath. SegAnyPath has the potential to advance the field of pathology analysis and improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. The code is available at https://github.com/wagnchogn/SegAnyPath.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for positioning of robots and autonomous systems and mapping of their surrounding environments is a task of major significance in various applications. However, the main disadvantage of traditional SLAM is that the deployed backend modules suffer from accumulative error caused by sharp viewpoint changes, diverse weather conditions, etc. As such, in order to improve the localization accuracy of the moving agents, we propose a cost-effective and loosely coupled relocalization backend, deployed on top of original SLAM algorithms, which exploits the topologies of poses and landmarks generated either by camera, LiDAR or mechanical sensors, in order to couple and fuse them. This novel fusion scheme enhances the decision-making ability and adaptability of autonomous systems, akin to human cognition, by elaborating Graph Laplacian Processing concept with Kalman Filters. Initially designed for cooperative localization of active road users, this approach optimally combines multisensor information through graph signal processing and Bayesian estimation for self positioning. Conducted experiments were focused on evaluating how our approach can improve the positioning of autonomous ground vehicles, as prominent examples of robots and autonomous systems equipped with sensing capabilities, in challenging outdoor environments. More specifically, experiments were carried out using CARLA simulator in order to generate different types of driving trajectories and environmental conditions, as well as real automotive data captured by an operating vehicle in Langen, Germany. Evaluation study demonstrates that localization accuracy is greatly improved both in terms of overall trajectory error as well as loop closing accuracy for each sensor fusion configuration.",

    "abstract": "The widely deployed ways to capture a set of unorganized points, e.g., merged laser scans, fusion of depth images, and structure-from- $x$ , usually yield a 3-D noisy point cloud. Accurate normal estimation for the noisy point cloud makes a crucial contribution to the success of various applications. However, the existing normal estimation wisdoms strive to meet a conflicting goal of simultaneously performing normal filtering and preserving surface features, which inevitably leads to inaccurate estimation results. We propose a normal estimation neural network (Norest-Net), which regards normal filtering and feature preservation as two separate tasks, so that each one is specialized rather than traded off. For full noise removal, we present a normal filtering network (NF-Net) branch by learning from the noisy height map descriptor (HMD) of each point to the ground-truth (GT) point normal; for surface feature recovery, we construct a normal refinement network (NR-Net) branch by learning from the bilaterally defiltered point normal descriptor (B-DPND) to the GT point normal. Moreover, NR-Net is detachable to be incorporated into the existing normal estimation methods to boost their performances. Norest-Net shows clear improvements over the state of the arts in both feature preservation and noise robustness on synthetic and real-world captured point clouds.",

    "abstract": "Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) leverages both video and audio information for model training, aiming to classify new video categories that were not seen during the training. However, existing methods often failed to learn robust multi-modal feature representations because they overlook the importance of object-aware images. Moreover, these methods require complete modal information to operate effectively, which limits their performance in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Object-Aware Image Augmentation Network (OAIA) for audio-visual ZSL. OAIA introduces a Cross-Modal Feature Augmentation (CMFA) subnet and a Missing Modality Generation (MMG) subnet to enhance feature representations and generate virtual features for missing modalities. Specifically, the CMFA subnet uses attention mechanisms to integrate and enhance the features of video, audio, and object-aware images, providing a richer training signal for the model and promoting the learning of more diverse and discriminative multi-modal representations. The MMG subnet employs a multi-layer perceptron to generate virtual features for missing modalities based on existing modal information, ensuring that the model can operate effectively even when modal data is incomplete during testing. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Objective. This study has two purposes: (a) to compare the use of tumor cell suspensions and excised tumor tissue for generating renal tumors suitable for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) studies and (b) to assess the efficacy of RFA for ablation of renal VX2 tumors in a rabbit model. Procedures. VX2 tumor masses were used to inoculate 17 rabbits. The renal VX2 tumors of 13 rabbits were subsequently treated with a cooled-tip RF system at a power of 15-30 W for 3-6 minutes, and 4 rabbits served as control. After RFA, rabbits were observed by contrast-enhanced CT to ascertain the ablative range. Rabbits were divided into three groups and sacrificed at 3, 7, and 14 days post-treatment for histopathological studies. Results. Both tumor implant methods had a 100% success rate in generating tumors. The average lesion produced was 1.3Ã1.8Ã1.5 cm. Complete tumor ablation occurred in 76.9%, and local tumor growth in 23.1%. Depending on the position of the tumors, the complications after RFA treatment included infarction, perirenal hematoma, hydronephrosis, and abscess. The over-all complication rate was 38.5%. In histopathological studies, a central needle track, tumor coagulation, renal tissue coagulation, peripheral hemorrhage, and an inflammatory layer could be observed. Conclusion and clinical relevance. Application of RFA to destroy renal VX2 tumors in this rabbit model has a relatively high cure rate. It can be used to destroy small renal tumors in a precise and non-invasive manner. Impact on human medicine. We hope to apply this procedure in selected human renal tumors in the future.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has revolutionized high-precision positioning services. However, the accuracy of these systems is significantly compromised by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) signals, especially in urban canyons. Specifically, Line-of-Sight (LOS) signals are obstructed, and the reflections lead to substantial errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for identifying NLOS signals. However, traditional methods often train models on extensive datasets from various environments and fine-tune them with new data to adjust to new scenarios. This fine-tuning can result in catastrophic forgetting, which impairs the models' generalization performance across different environments. To address the limitations of model fine-tuning, we introduce NICL, an approach for N LOS I dentification with C ontinual L earning. NICL preserves performance on previously encountered scenarios while adapting to new environments by employing simple regularization techniques that do not require access to the data from the old scenarios. Specifically, our method incorporates Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization and explainability-based regularization to maintain the model's prior outputs and the logic behind those outputs, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on real-world GNSS datasets have shown that our NICL method outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 5%-12% in NLOS identification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Objective : Working with the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices has become popular in electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. Frequently selected for its speed property is the manifold geometry provided by the log-euclidean Riemannian metric. However, the kernels used in the log-euclidean framework are not canonically based on the underlying geometry. Therefore, we introduce a new canonical log-euclidean (CLE) kernel. Methods : We used the log-euclidean metric tensor on the SPD manifold to derive the CLE kernel. We compared it with existing kernels, namely the affine-invariant, log-euclidean, and Gaussian log-euclidean kernel. For comparison, we tested the kernels on two paradigms: classification and dimensionality reduction. Each paradigm was evaluated on five open-access brain-computer interface datasets with motor-imagery tasks across multiple sessions. Performance was measured as balanced classification accuracy using a leave-one-session-out cross-validation. Dimensionality reduction performance was measured using AUClogRNX. Results : The CLE kernel itself is simple and easily turned into code, which is provided in addition to all the analytical solutions to relevant equations in the log-euclidean framework. The CLE kernel significantly outperformed existing log-euclidean kernels in classification tasks and was several times faster than the affine-invariant kernel for most datasets. Conclusion : We found that adhering to the geometrical structure significantly improves the accuracy over two commonly used log-euclidean kernels while keeping the speed advantages of the log-euclidean framework. Significance : The CLE provides a good choice as a kernel in time-critical applications and fills a gap in the kernel methods of the log-euclidean framework.",

    "abstract": "Existing integrated sensing and communication technology designed for monostatic settings segregates sensing and communication (S&C) at distinct terminals, impeding their adaptability to network paradigms. In this paper, we propose a general framework for joint target-localization and data-detection (JTD) in bistatic settings by using a combination of the deterministic known (DK) and random unknown (RU) symbols, e.g., pilot and data symbols. We first derive the performance limits for target localization-related parameters with combined symbols. We demonstrate that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for target localization using the DK part can be expressed in a closed form through orthogonal projection, while that using the RU part aligns with the modified FIM in monostatic settings at an exponential rate with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, we propose a JTD scheme to exploit the reciprocal advantages for S&C, i.e., the detected data symbols are harnessed to enhance the target localization in an alternating way. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed JTD scheme.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of smart consumer devices has given rise to the consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), enabling immense data collection and valuable insights for enhancing con-sumer experiences. However, the distributed nature of CIoT sys-tems and the sensitivity of consumer data pose significant chal-lenges in ensuring security, privacy, and zero trust. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating robust federated learning with a main-side blockchain architecture and zero trust principles to enable secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collabo-rative learning in CIoT environments. The proposed system model consists of CIoT devices as side nodes, edge servers as main nodes, and a cloud server for global aggregation. A lightweight privacy-preserving aggregation protocol is designed based on secret shar-ing to protect raw data during local model updates. To enhance the robustness against Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, a resampling-based robust aggregation method is developed, which evaluates the cosine similarity of local updates against a ref-erence gradient securely selected via the main-side blockchain. Ex-periments demonstrate that the proposed framework performs well regarding model accuracy, convergence speed, and resiliency compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Depth perception is crucial for spatial understanding and has traditionally been achieved through stereoscopic imaging. However, the precision of depth estimation using stereoscopic methods depends on the accurate calibration of binocular vision sensors. Monocular cameras, while more accessible, often suffer from reduced accuracy, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Optical sensors, too, face limitations in adverse environments, leading researchers to explore radar technology as a reliable alternative. Although radar provides coarse but accurate signals, its integration with fine-grained monocular camera data remains underexplored. In this research, we propose DepthSense, a novel radar-assisted monocular depth enhancement approach. DepthSense employs an encoder-decoder architecture, a Radar Residual Network, feature fusion with a spatial attention mechanism, and an ordinal regression layer to deliver precise depth estimations. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to validate the effectiveness of DepthSense. Our methodology not only surpasses existing approaches in quantitative performance but also reduces parameter complexity and inference times. Our findings demonstrate that DepthSense represents a significant advancement over traditional stereo methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for depth estimation in autonomous driving. By leveraging the complementary strengths of radar and monocular camera data, DepthSense sets a new benchmark in the field, paving the way for more reliable and accurate spatial perception systems.",

    "abstract": "Pavlovian associative memory plays an important role in our daily life and work. The realization of Pavlovian associative memory at the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecular level will promote the development of biological computing and broaden the application scenarios of neural networks. In this article, bionic associative memory and temporal order memory circuits are constructed by DNA strand displacement (DSD) reactions. First, a temporal logic gate is constructed on the basis of DSD circuit and extended to a three-input temporal logic gate. The output of temporal logic gate is used for the weight species of associative memory. Second, the forgetting module and output module based on the DSD circuit are constructed to realize some functions of associative memory, including associative memory with simultaneous stimulus, associative memory with interstimulus interval effect, and the facilitation by intermittent stimulus. In addition, the coding, storage, and retrieval modules are designed based on the analysis and memory capabilities of temporal logic gate for temporal information. The temporal order memory circuit is constructed, demonstrating the temporal order memory ability of DNA circuit. Finally, the reliability of the circuit is verified through Visual DSD software simulation. Our work provides ideas and inspiration to construct more complex DNA bionic circuits and intelligent circuits by using DSD technology.",

    "abstract": "Neural volumetric representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a compelling technique for learning to represent 3D scenes from images with the goal of rendering photorealistic images of the scene from unobserved viewpoints. However, NeRF's computational requirements are prohibitive for real-time applications: rendering views from a trained NeRF requires querying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hundreds of times per ray . We present a method to train a NeRF, then precompute and store (i.e. âbakeâ) it as a novel representation called a Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) that enables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. To achieve this, we introduce 1) a reformulation of NeRF's architecture, and 2) a sparse voxel grid representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representation retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent appearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can be rendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU). Actual screen captures are shown in our video.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission design for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By considering both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, we jointly optimize the covariance matrix of the transmitter and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients of the STAR-RIS and formulate two transmit power minimization problems. For the optimization problem in the perfect CSI scenario, we develop a penalty-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to handle it. For the optimization problem in the imperfect CSI scenario, this paper is the first work to study the robust beamforming design for STAR-RIS-assisted secure MIMO systems. To address this challenging problem, we first use the inequalities of the determinant to transform it into an equivalent form. Then, we use the generalized S-procedure to handle the worst-case constraints. Finally, we develop a penalty-based AO algorithm. Performance evaluation results show that the two proposed optimization algorithms significantly reduce the transmit power compared to other baseline schemes.",

    "abstract": "To achieve real-time transmission of extensive remote sensing data, the combination of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) and free-space optical (FSO) technology is considered a suitable solution. However, the strongly attenuated atmosphere environment that covers long spatial distances and frequent handover of user-to-data links seriously affect the reliability of FSO links. As a relay linking the satellite layer and the ground layer, the introduction of high altitude platform (HAP) shortens the ultra-long satellite-to-ground FSO links, largely mitigating unreliable tropospheric connections. In order to achieve the improvement of the reliability of the whole SAGIN system, this paper integrates the space, air and ground three-layer network through HAP networking (HAPN). Based on HAPN architecture, the reliability enhancement scheme for two-hop FSO links is further designed. The first step is to reduce the attenuation of atmosphere turbulence by adjusting the HAP zenith angle through distanced clustering and Tabo search algorithms. The second step is to reduce the link handover times by extending the time window flexibly through HAP networking. The results show that the proposed schemes based on HAPN improve the reliability of the whole process of data transmission.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive survey and benchmark of both traditional and learning-based methods for surface reconstruction from point clouds. This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors such as noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can require tedious hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce higher-quality surfaces compared to their traditional counterpartsâeven in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction.

    "abstract": "The popularity and widespread usage of machine learning (ML) hardware have created challenges for its intellectual property (IP) protection. Logic locking is a widely used technique for IP protection but has received little attention in error-resilient applications such as ML hardware modules. This work investigates the effectiveness of logic locking when applied to tree-based ML circuits and reveals a critical vulnerability that undermines its effectiveness for single-label ML classifiers. We propose a logic locking scheme to eliminate the vulnerabilities in decision trees (DTs) and random forests (RFs) circuits. In our extensive simulation involving 16 DTs and 16 RFs, our solution consistently thwarts the vulnerability. We further evaluated the security of our approach by considering different obfuscation percentages and launching state-of-the-art oracle-less attacks on logic locking. Our method proves resilient, indicating that by fixing the identified vulnerability, we did not introduce new attack vectors. Further, our investigation indicates that DT/RF accelerators are significantly less vulnerable to oracle-less attacks compared to exact circuits. Overall, our work lays the foundation for future investigations into the effectiveness of logic locking for ML circuits.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for market agents solving decision-making problems in electricity markets. Vanilla RL enables agents to learn optimal policies in dynamic and uncertain market environments via trial and error. However, uncertainties in state transitions are often treated as exogenous state features with statistical errors. This approach can result in policies that are sensitive to perturbations of these uncertainties, potentially leading to performance degradation. This sensitivity is particularly critical in electricity markets, where the penetration of renewable energy and demand variability are increasing. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust adversarial RL algorithm aimed at learning a robust optimal policy that accounts for market uncertainties in state transitions to systematically mitigate sensitivity to perturbations in uncertain environments. Specifically, we leverage the uncertainty set regularizer technique to define uncertainty sets within the parametric space of state transitions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adversarial approach to generate unknown uncertainty sets using the value function as a basis. We finally conduct a comprehensive assessment of the robust adversarial RL algorithm across three electricity market applications: strategic bidding, retail pricing, and peer-to-peer energy trading, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness performance against various uncertainties.",

To accelerate the completion of sensing missions, including data transmission, the sensing task is divided into individual private sensing tasks for each UAV and a common sensing task that is executed by all UAVs to enable cooperative transmission. Unlike existing studies, we explore the use of an advanced cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, which effectively manages inter-UAV interference. To further optimize wireless channel utilization, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy that combines time-division multiple access (TDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and cooperative transmission. The problem of jointly optimizing task splitting ratios and the hybrid TDMA-NOMA-cooperative transmission strategy is formulated with the objective of minimizing mission completion time. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation and hybrid transmission scheme in accelerating the completion of sensing missions.",

    "abstract": "As a challenging computer vision task, Scene Graph Generation (SGG) finds the latent semantic relationships among objects from a given image, which may be limited by the datasets and real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a novel incremental learning task called Relationship-Incremental Scene Graph Generation (RISGG) that learns the semantic relationships among objects in an incremental way. Compared with classic Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) problem, RISGG suffers from its special issues: (1) Old class shift â the relationship-labeled object pair may have different labels during different learning sessions. (2) Background shift â the relationship-unlabeled object pair may not be a real unlabeled one. In this work, we address the above issues from the following aspects. First, we present a Divide-and-Conquer (DaC) pipeline to deal with the old class shift via decoupling the recognition of relationship classes and recognizing relationships individually. In this way, label confusion and interaction among different relationships are eliminated during training. Second, we propose a Feature Adapter (FA) to bridge the feature space gap between the current session and the previous one and use our extra supervision to mine old relationship information in the current session. Our proposed network combined DaC and FA, abbreviated DaCFA-Net, for RISGG. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the significant performance gain of DaCFA-Net in RISGG. It gains about 20% improvement against the SGG baselines on the popular VG dataset.",

    "abstract": "Surface mounted technology (SMT) welding defect detection plays a key role in the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) production process, which affects the use of electronic products and cost. Previous works tend to realizing defect detection with only defect samples and they assume that there are sufficient defect samples. However, defect samples are usually difficult to collect in real-life scenarios while enough template samples can be easily obtained. In addition, most existing works carry out defect detection based on benchmarks with simple backgrounds of PCBA, which is not suitable for PCBA with complex structures in modern electronic product manufacturing. To address the above issues, we propose a template-guidance Siamese network based on YOLO for SMT welding defect detection (TGSYOLO), which is deployed on a real SMT automatic optical inspection system (AOI). First, the two-stream structure is introduced to extract deep features in defect images and template images, in which template features are served as guidance knowledge. Then, template fusion Transformer (TFT) is proposed to model global features between detect and template features in the low-level stage, which could acquire long-range correlations to force the network to focus on potential defect regions. Next, to avoid the disappearance of tiny defect features during deep feature fusion, a multi-scale attention feature pyramid network (MAFPN) is proposed to directly fuse defect semantic information from low-level features, which retains detailed expressions of defects through skip connection and obtains compact fusion features. Furthermore, we collect limited welding defect samples based on more complex PCBA backgrounds than previous works through a real SMT AOI system. Experiments on the limited dataset show that TGSYOLO could reach 0.985 of mAP@0.5, 0.885 of mAP@0.75 and 0.984 of F1, which is 0.008, 0.054 and 0.025 higher than other SOTA methods. Also, generalization experiments on the public De...",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task for medical image analysis and surgical planning. In recent years, UNet-based networks have prevailed in the field of medical image segmentation. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from limited receptive fields, which fail to model the long-range dependency of organs or tumors. Besides, these models are heavily dependent on the training of the final segmentation head. And existing methods can not well address aforementioned limitations simultaneously. Hence, in our work, we proposed a novel shape prior module (SPM), which can explicitly introduce shape priors to promote the segmentation performance of UNet-based models. The explicit shape priors consist of global and local shape priors. The former with coarse shape representations provides networks with capabilities to model global contexts. The latter with finer shape information serves as additional guidance to relieve the heavy dependence on the learnable prototype in the segmentation head. To evaluate the effectiveness of SPM, we conduct experiments on three challenging public datasets. And our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SPM can serve as a plug-and-play structure into classic CNNs and Transformer-based backbones, facilitating the segmentation task on different datasets.

    "abstract": "Open canal gate control is an essential type of water resources management for irrigation and water diversion. However, accurately predicting gate operation in open canal control remains a vital regulation algorithm in Internet of Water irrigation. One-to-many mapping relationship between water discharge requirement and gate operation strategy makes the predicting problem difficult. Therefore, real-world application is mostly human-experiences depended. This article proposes a multitask sequential neural model with a two-phase learnerâevaluator procedure tackling the one-to-many mapping relationship. The evaluator is first trained for water discharge prediction with gate control operations. Then, the learner is trained with the optimized evaluator to tackle the gate control operation prediction with the indicated water discharge requirements. Considering actual gate control scenarios, the change of gate opening heights is introduced as one of the multitask optimization targets. Results show that the proposed model achieves a high accuracy, and has higher efficiency than the numerical calculation method.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning (MT-MARL) is capable of leveraging useful knowledge across multiple related tasks to improve performance on any single task. While recent studies have tentatively achieved this by learning independent policies on a shared representation space, we pinpoint that further advancements can be realized by explicitly characterizing agent interactions within these multi-agent tasks and identifying task relations for selective reuse. To this end, this article proposes Representing Interactions and Tasks (RIT), a novel MT-MARL algorithm that characterizes both intra-task agent interactions and inter-task task relations. Specifically, for characterizing agent interactions, RIT presents the interactive value decomposition to explicitly take the dependency among agents into policy learning. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the learned utility value of each agent approximates its Shapley value, thus representing agent interactions. Moreover, we learn task representations based on per-agent local trajectories, which assess task similarities and accordingly identify task relations. As a result, RIT facilitates the effective transfer of interaction knowledge across similar multi-agent tasks. Structurally, RIT develops universal policy structure for scalable multi-task policy learning. We evaluate RIT against multiple state-of-the-art baselines in various cooperative tasks, and its significant performance under both multi-task and zero-shot settings demonstrates its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formally address universal object detection, which aims to detect every category in every scene. The dependence on human annotations, the limited visual information, and the novel categories in open world severely restrict the universality of detectors. We propose UniDetector, a universal object detector that recognizes enormous categories in the open world. The critical points for UniDetector are: 1) it leverages images of multiple sources and heterogeneous label spaces in training through image-text alignment, which guarantees sufficient information for universal representations. 2) it involves heterogeneous supervision training, which alleviates the dependence on the limited fully-labeled images. 3) it generalizes to open world easily while keeping the balance between seen and unseen classes. 4) it further promotes generalizing to novel categories through our proposed decoupling training manner and probability calibration. These contributions allow UniDetector to detect over 7k categories, the largest measurable size so far, with only about 500 classes participating in training. Our UniDetector behaves the strong zero-shot ability on large-vocabulary datasets - it surpasses supervised baselines by more than 5% without seeing any corresponding images. On 13 detection datasets with various scenes, UniDetector also achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3% amount of training data.",

    "abstract": "For rapid on-orbit forwarding of high-resolution remote sensing images, the combination of very low Earth orbit (VLEO) and optical inter-satellite links (OISL) has recently emerged as a focus of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). However, at the height of VLEO, not only does the attenuation factor of the optical signal-to-noise ratio grow exponentially, but the service with more than ten times bandwidth expansion, which adds a significant burden to the buffer queue. To address the above reliability and latency challenges, this paper proposes a routing framework based on the characteristics of the VLEO scenario. Specifically, the OISL path in VLEO is modelled first. In order to reduce the severe impact of multi-hop on the routing performance, we perform dynamic group scheduling for OISL. Additionally, taking advantage of the fact that remote sensing missions can be scheduled in advance, we adopt a âroute first, then establish linksâ approach to specifically plan service paths. Considering the coordination of a single service and overall network performance, this problem is solved using a Q-value decomposed multi-agent reinforcement learning method. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme maintains excellent reliability and latency performance under VLEO scenarios with varying heights, network scales, and traffic loads.",

    "abstract": "As one representative framework of self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL) has drawn enormous attention in the representation learning area. By pulling together a âpositiveâ example and an anchor, as well as pushing away many ânegativeâ examples from the anchor, CL is able to generate high-quality representations for the data of different modalities. Therefore, the qualities of selected positive and negative examples are critical for the performance of CL-based models. However, due to the assumption of label unavailability, most existing work follows the paradigm of contrastive instance discrimination, which treats each input instance as an individual category. Therefore, they focused more on positive example generation and designed plenty of data augmentation strategies. For negative examples, they just leverage the in-batch negative sampling strategy. We argue that this negative sampling strategy will easily select false negatives and inhibit the capability of CL, which we also believe is one of the reasons why a large size of negatives is needed in CL. Apart from using annotated labels, we try to tackle this problem in an unsupervised manner. We propose to integrate expectation maximization (EM) into the selection of negative examples and develop a novel EM-enhanced negative sampling strategy (EMCRL) to distinguish false negatives from true ones for CL performance improvement. Specifically, EMCRL employs EM to estimate the distribution of ground-truth relations between each sample and corresponding in-batch negatives and then optimizes model parameters with the estimations. Considering the sensitivity of EM algorithm to the parameter initialization, we propose to add a random flip into the distribution estimation to enhance the robustness of the learning process. Extensive experiments over several advanced models on sentence representation and image representation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMCRL . Our method is easy to implemen...",

    "abstract": "Ranking-based skill assessment is an essential component of video understanding. In this task lacking precise procedure annotations, existing methods place greater emphasis on evaluating the procedure quality via manually normalizing the execution duration. However, the inherent duration-related procedural patterns will undergo alteration. Experimentally, we discover that distinct duration biases are prevalent in duration-sensitive skills, such as those in medical and everyday life. Hence, duration information is crucial for ranking-based skill assessment when dealing with varying durations. Additionally, similar execution processes tend to have closer execution durations. Thus, another critical factor lies in extracting duration-related procedural information alongside similar durations. It is defined as mining rhythm patterns, which are inspired by music rhythms including various duration and duration-related procedures. In our work, a rhythm-aware transformer is proposed to mine the rhythm patterns adaptively. Given pairwise inputs, a coattention module is designed to mutually highlight duration-related procedure information when comparing pairwise input videos with similar durations, and adaptively attenuate the efficacy when confronted with pairwise inputs featuring significantly different durations. A rhythm-encoding module further embeds duration information into the concatenation of raw features and co-attention features. Following these features, the transformer decoder is designed to learn duration-related queries supervised by a novel duration grouping loss among various duration groups. The experimental results demonstrate that the rhythm-aware transformer is effective for ranking-based skill assessment.",

    "abstract": "Wireless-powered communications (WPCs) are increasingly crucial for extending the lifespan of low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Furthermore, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can create favorable electromagnetic environments by providing alternative signal paths to counteract blockages. The strategic integration of WPC and RIS technologies can significantly enhance energy transfer and data transmission efficiency. However, passive RISs suffer from double-fading attenuation over RIS-aided cascaded links. In this article, we propose the application of an active RIS within WPC-enabled IoT networks. The enhanced flexibility of the active RIS in terms of energy transfer and information transmission is investigated using adjustable parameters. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the ergodic rate and outage probability by incorporating key parameters, including signal amplification, active noise, power consumption, and phase quantization errors. Additionally, we explore the optimization of WPC scenarios, focusing on the time-switching factor and power consumption of the active RIS. The results validate our analysis, demonstrating that an active RIS significantly enhances WPC performance compared to a passive RIS.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of knowledge tracing (KT) is to evaluate studentsâ understanding and mastery of knowledge through their responses to exercises, which aids in predicting their future performance. Deep neural networks have been widely applied in the area of knowledge tracing and have demonstrated encouraging results. Nevertheless, in real-world scenarios, there is a substantial amount of noise in studentsâ response records. These noises may amplify the inherent risk of overfitting in deep neural networks, leading to a decrease in model performance. To address these issues, we introduce a new model called filter knowledge tracing (FKT). This innovative model incorporates a learnable filter into KT to filter out noise information from studentsâ exercise sequences. We redefine the input paradigm of the data, using learnable filters to perform filtering operations in its frequency domain representation space, effectively removing noise. Additionally, an attention module has been introduced in the FKT model to evaluate the impact of studentsâ historical interactions on their current knowledge state. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments utilizing four publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that FKT outperforms existing benchmarks, particularly on larger datasets, signifying an improvement in KT performance while effectively reducing the risk of overfitting.",

    "abstract": "Long-term urban mobility predictions play a crucial role in the effective management of urban facilities and services. Conventionally, urban mobility data has been structured as spatiotemporal videos, treating longitude and latitude grids as fundamental pixels. Consequently, video prediction methods, relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have been instrumental in this domain. In our research, we introduce a fresh perspective on urban mobility prediction. Instead of oversimplifying urban mobility data as traditional video data, we regard it as a complex multivariate time series. This perspective involves treating the time-varying values of each grid in each channel as individual time series. To tackle the prediction of these time series, we present the Super-Multivariate Urban Mobility Transformer (SUMformer), which utilizes a specially designed attention mechanism to calculate temporal and cross-variable correlations and reduce computational costs stemming from a large number of time series. SUMformer also employs low-frequency filters to extract essential information for long-term predictions. Furthermore, SUMformer is structured with a temporal patch merge mechanism, forming a hierarchical framework that enables the capture of multi-scale correlations. Consequently, it excels in urban mobility pattern modeling and long-term prediction, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods across five real-world datasets. The code is available at: https://github.com/Chengyui/SUMformer.",

    "abstract": "In the increasingly digitized world, the privacy and security of sensitive data shared via IoT devices are paramount. Traditional privacy-preserving methods like k-anonymity and ldiversity are becoming outdated due to technological advancements. In addition, data owners often worry about misuse and unauthorized access to their personal information. To address this, we propose a secure data-sharing framework that uses local differential privacy (LDP) within a permissioned blockchain, enhanced by federated learning (FL) in a zero-trust environment. To further protect sensitive data shared by IoT devices, we use the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and cryptographic hash functions to create unique digital fingerprints for files. We mainly evaluate our system based on latency, throughput, privacy accuracy, and transaction efficiency, comparing the performance to a benchmark model. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms its counterpart in terms of latency, throughput, and transaction efficiency. The proposed model achieved a lower average latency of 4.0 seconds compared to the benchmark modelâs 5.3 seconds. In terms of throughput, the proposed model achieved a higher throughput of 10.53 TPS (transactions per second) compared to the benchmark modelâs 8 TPS. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves 85% accuracy, whereas the counterpart achieves only 49%.",

    "abstract": "Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)-based computing promises drastic improvement in performance at extremely low temperatures (e.g., 77K, 10K). The field of extreme lowtemperature CMOS environment-based computing holds the promise of delivering remarkable enhancements in both performance and power consumption. Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) plays a major role in determining the performance and efficiency of any processor due to its superior performance and density. This work aims to reveal how extreme low-temperature operations profoundly impact the existing well-known trade-offs in SRAM-based memory arrays. To accomplish this, first, we measure and model the 5nm Fin Field-Effect Transistors (FinFETs) characteristics over a wide temperature range from 300K down to 10K. Next, we develop a framework to perform simulations on the SRAM array by varying the number of rows and columns for examining the influence of leakage current (Ileak), and parasitic effects of Bit-Line (BL) and Word-Line (WL) on the size and performance of the SRAM array under extreme low-temperatures. For a comprehensive analysis, we further investigated the maximum attainable array size, extending our study down to 10K, utilizing three distinct cell types. With the help of SRAM array simulations, we reveal that the maximum array size at extremely low temperatures is limited by WL parasitics instead of Ileak, and the performance of the SRAM is governed by BL and WL parasitics. Additionally, we elucidate the influence of transistor threshold voltage (VTH) engineering on the optimization of the SRAM array at extreme low-temperature environments.",

    "abstract": "To ensure the privacy and security of charging services under Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) environment, it is critical to secure the charging stations (CSs) interaction with multiple electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we construct a heterogeneous broadcast signcryption protocol supporting equality test for IoVs (HBSC-ET), which addresses the communication problem between a CS and EVs featured with One-to-Many properties. In our design, the CS is allocated in public key infrastructure cryptosystem (PKI), while the EVs are equipped in identity-based cryptography (IBC). In order to address the restriction of EVs storage resources, the received ciphertexts at EV side, are alternatively uploaded to cloud server running equality test. Here, the cloud server legitimately executes the equality test, to determine whether two ciphertexts conclude the same message without unsigncryption. With this, the design HBSC-ET is advanced in terms of information utilization ratio. Finally, the rigorous experiment as well as performance analysis elaborate that our proposed scheme is more suitable for charging services in IoVs.",

    "abstract": "This work pays the first research effort to leverage point cloud sequence-based Self-supervised 3-D Action Feature Learning (S3AFL), under textâs cross-modality weak supervision. We intend to fill the huge performance gap between point cloud sequence and 3-D skeleton-based manners. The key intuition derives from the observation that skeleton-based manners actually hold the human poseâs high-level knowledge that leads to attention on the bodyâs joint-aware local parts. Inspired by this, we propose to introduce the textâs weak supervision of high-level semantics into a point cloud sequence-based paradigm. With RGB-point cloud pair sequence acquired via RGB-D camera, text sequence is first generated from RGB component using pretrained image captioning model, as auxiliary weak supervision. Then, S3AFL runs in a cross and intra-modality contrastive learning (CL) way. To resist textâs missing and redundant semantics, feature learning is conducted in a multistage way with semantic refinement. Essentially, text is only required for training. To facilitate the featureâs representation power on fine-grained actions, a multirank max-pooling (MR-MP) way is also proposed for the point set network to better maintain discriminative clues. Experiments verify that the textâs weak supervision can facilitate performance by 10.8%, 10.4%, and 8.0% on NTU RGB\n+\nD 60, 120, and N-UCLA at most. The performance gap between point cloud sequence and skeleton-based manners has been remarkably narrowed down. The idea of transferring textâs weak supervision to S3AFL can also be applied to a skeleton manner, with strong generality. The source code is available at https://github.com/tangent-T/W3AMT.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) for pinhole-to-panoramic semantic segmentation, given only a pinhole image pre-trained model (i.e., source) and unlabeled panoramic images (i.e., target). Tackling this problem is non-trivial due to three critical challenges: 1) semantic mismatches from the distinct Field-of-View (FoV) between domains, 2) style discrepancies inherent in the UDA problem, and 3) inevitable distortion of the panoramic images. To tackle these problems, we propose 360SFUDA++ that effectively extracts knowledge from the source pinhole model with only unlabeled panoramic images and transfers the reliable knowledge to the target panoramic domain. Specifically, we first utilize Tangent Projection (TP) as it has less distortion and meanwhile slits the equirectangular projection (ERP) to patches with fixed FoV projection (FFP) to mimic the pinhole images. Both projections are shown effective in extracting knowledge from the source model. However, as the distinct projections make it less possible to directly transfer knowledge between domains, we then propose Reliable Panoramic Prototype Adaptation Module (RP $^{2}$ AM) to transfer knowledge at both prediction and prototype levels. RP $^{2}$ AM selects the confident knowledge and integrates panoramic prototypes for reliable knowledge adaptation. Moreover, we introduce Cross-projection Dual Attention Module (CDAM), which better aligns the spatial and channel characteristics across projections at the feature level between domains. Both knowledge extraction and transfer processes are synchronously updated to reach the best performance. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including outdoor and indoor scenarios, demonstrate that our 360SFUDA++ achieves significantly better performance than prior SFUDA methods.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Multipath components (MPCs) of wireless channels can be described as clusters of scatterers and reflectors with specific delay and angular power spectrum densities (PSDs). Hence, cluster-based wireless channel modeling has been widely adopted to characterize propagation environments for a good tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity. To enhance the performance of channel modeling, accurate clustering algorithms for MPCs are required. However, the accuracy of the existing kernel-power-density (KPD) algorithm for MPC clustering is limited by user-specific parameters, such as the nearest MPCs in the density calculation and the threshold in the cluster merging. In this paper, an improved KPD clustering algorithm is proposed without relying on priori knowledge. Specifically, the densities of MPCs and the minimum distance from one MPC to other MPCs with higher densities are jointly considered. A two-stage clustering method is used to mitigate the impact of the user-specific parameters. The key MPCs are found in the first stage. A novel criterion for determining cluster centroids is implemented in the second stage to merge neighbouring clusters generated in the first stage. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, both simulation and measurement validations are performed. Results support the superiority of the improved KPD algorithm over the existing KPD algorithm for MPC clustering.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian detection currently suffers from two issues in crowded scenes: occlusion and dense boundary prediction, making it still challenging in complex real-world scenarios. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown their superiorities in addressing these issues, where ViTs capture global feature dependency to infer occlusion parts and CNNs make accurate dense predictions by local detailed features. Nevertheless, limited by the narrow receptive field, CNNs fail to infer occlusion parts, while ViTs tend to ignore local features that are vital to distinguish different pedestrians in the crowd. Therefore, it is essential to combine the advantages of CNN and ViT for pedestrian detection. However, manually designing a specific CNN and ViT hybrid network requires enormous time and resources for trial and error. To address this issue, we propose the first Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework specifically designed for pedestrian detection named NAS-PED, which automatically designs an appropriate CNNs and ViTs hybrid backbone for the crowded pedestrian detection task. Specifically, we formulate transformers and convolutions with various kernel sizes in the same format, which provides an unconstrained space for diverse hybrid network search. Furthermore, to search for a suitable backbone, we propose an information bottleneck based NAS objective function, which treats the process of NAS as an information extraction process, preserving relevant information and suppressing redundant information from the dense pedestrians in crowd scenes Extensive experiments on CrowdHuman, CityPersons and EuroCity Persons datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our NAS-PED obtains absolute gains of 4.0% MR $^{-2}$ and 1.9% AP over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pedestrian detection framework on CrowdHuman datasets. For the CityPersons and EuroCity Persons datasets, the searched backbone achieves stable improvement a...",

    "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of seen primitives. Prior studies have attempted to either learn primitives individually (non-connected) or establish dependencies among them in the composition (fully-connected). In contrast, human comprehension of composition diverges from the aforementioned methods as humans possess the ability to make composition-aware adaptation for these primitives, instead of inferring them rigidly through the aforementioned methods. However, developing a comprehension of compositions akin to human cognition proves challenging within the confines of real space. This arises from the limitation of real-space-based methods, which often categorize attributes, objects, and compositions using three independent measures, without establishing a direct dynamic connection. To tackle this challenge, we expand the CZSL distance metric scheme to encompass complex spaces to unify the independent measures, and we establish an imaginary-connected embedding in complex space to model human understanding of attributes. To achieve this representation, we introduce an innovative visual bias-based attribute extraction module that selectively extracts attributes based on object prototypes. As a result, we are able to incorporate phase information in training and inference, serving as a metric for attribute-object dependencies while preserving the independent acquisition of primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on three benchmark datasets, illustrating its superiority compared to baseline methods.

    "abstract": "Healthcare has witnessed an increased digitalization in the post-COVID world. Technologies such as the medical Internet of Things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely:\nâ\n1\n(Policy and Compliance Management),\nâ\n2\n(Employee Training and Awareness),\nâ\n3\n(Data Protection and Privacy Control),\nâ\n4\n(Monitoring and Response), and\nâ\n5\n(Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that\nâ\n3\nactivities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by\nâ\n1\nand\nâ\n2\nactivities. Finally,\nâ\n4\nand\nâ\n5\nshould be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) in mobile environments faces significant communication bottlenecks. Gradient compression has proven as an effective solution to this issue, offering substantial benefits in environments with limited bandwidth and metered data. Yet, it encounters severe performance drops in non-IID environments due to a one-size-fits-all compression approach, which does not account for the varying data volumes across workers. Assigning varying compression ratios to workers with distinct data distributions and volumes is therefore a promising solution. This work derives the convergence rate of distributed SGD with non-uniform compression, which reveals the intricate relationship between model convergence and the compression ratios applied to individual workers. Accordingly, we frame the relative compression ratio assignment as an\nn\n-variable chi-squared nonlinear optimization problem, constrained by a limited communication budget. We propose DAGC-R, which assigns conservative compression to workers handling larger data volumes. Recognizing the computational limitations of mobile devices, we propose the DAGC-A, which is computationally less demanding and enhances the robustness of compression in non-IID scenarios. Our experiments confirm that the DAGC-R and DAGC-A can speed up the training speed by up to\n25.43%\nand\n16.65%\ncompared to the uniform compression respectively, when dealing with highly imbalanced data volume distribution and restricted communication.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing surgical scenes is crucial for revealing internal anatomical structures during minimally invasive procedures. Novel View Synthesis is a vital technique that offers geometry and appearance reconstruction, enhancing understanding, planning, and decision-making in surgical scenes. Despite the impressive achievements of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), its direct application to surgical scenes produces unsatisfying results due to two challenges: endoscopic sparse views and significant photometric inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-aware conditional NeRF for novel view synthesis to tackle the severe shape-radiance ambiguity from sparse surgical views. The core of UC-NeRF is to incorporate the multi-view uncertainty estimation to condition the neural radiance field for modeling the severe photometric inconsistencies adaptively. Specifically, our UC-NeRF first builds a consistency learner in the form of multi-view stereo network, to establish the geometric correspondence from sparse views and generate uncertainty estimation and feature priors. In neural rendering, we design a base-adaptive NeRF network to exploit the uncertainty estimation for explicitly handling the photometric inconsistencies. Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided geometry distillation is employed to enhance geometry learning. Experiments on the SCARED and Hamlyn datasets demonstrate our superior performance in rendering appearance and geometry, consistently outperforming the current state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be released at https://github.com/wrld/UC-NeRF.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses the theory of point processes and stochastic geometry to quantify the sky visibility experienced by users located in an outdoor environment. The general idea is to represent the buildings of this environment as a stationary marked point process, where the points represent the building locations and the marks their heights. The point process framework is first used to characterize the distribution of the blockage angle, which limits the visibility of a typical user into the sky due to the obstruction by buildings. In the context of communications, this distribution is useful when users try to connect to the nodes of an aerial or non-terrestrial network in a Line-of-Sight way. Within this context, the point process framework can also be used to investigate the gain of connectivity obtained thanks to Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces. Assuming that such surfaces are installed on the top of buildings to extend the userâs sky visibility, this point process approach allows one to quantify the gain in visibility and hence the gain in connectivity obtained by the typical user. The distributional properties of visibility-related metrics are cross-validated by comparison to simulation results and 3GPP measurements.",

    "abstract": "Different from resistive loads, constant power loads (CPLs) may threaten the stability of power interfaces (PIs) due to the negative incremental impedance. As one of the promising PIs, dual active bridge (DAB) converters have received widespread attention. However, the large-signal stability criteria of DAB converters under CPLs remain challenging. To fill this gap, this paper thoroughly explores the inherent stability mechanism by analyzing the state trajectory of the DAB converter for the first time. Sufficient conditions for the large-signal stability of the closed-loop controlled DAB converter under CPLs are specified. Based on the derived trajectory operation criteria of DAB converters, an advanced boundary control in the geometrical domain is proposed to guarantee the large-signal stability of DAB converters feeding CPLs. Main design considerations and recommendations are given. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the start-up transient time by 50% and speed up the output-voltage-reference-change transient time by over 30% compared to the traditional control while ensuring a stable operation of DAB converters under CPLs.",

    "abstract": "Bandit online multiclass prediction plays an important role in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for it in the fully adversarial setting. This framework is based on our proposed marginbased gradient descent approach. Its update step provides an unbiased estimate of the surrogate loss gradient and has a lower variance than existing methods. It also enables our algorithms to update even for incorrect predictions by penalizing the wrong classes. The link function of the framework can evolve over time, gradually incorporating online data information including second-order information into the potential functions. Based on the proposed framework, we investigate first-order and secondorder bandit online multiclass prediction algorithms. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our proposed update rule and bandit online multiclass prediction framework. Finally, we compare our proposed first-order and second-order bandit online multiclass prediction algorithms with several state-of-theart baselines on two synthetic and four real-world datasets. The encouraging results show that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques",

    "abstract": "This research introduces a high-frequency CMOS meminductor, utilizing operational transconductance amplifiers and two grounded capacitors, thereby avoiding traditional components such as memristors, multipliers, and resistors. The design stands out for its simplicity and electronic adjustability, which facilitates control of the induced flux by altering the transconductance gain. We conducted transistor-level simulations with 180 nm CMOS technology to evaluate the meminductorâs performance across various parameters including voltage, frequency, temperature, process corner variations, and monte carlo simulations. These extensive tests confirm the durability and adaptability of the emulator across diverse conditions. The emulators operate up to 20 MHz with a remarkably low power consumption of just 0.44 mW, showcasing considerable efficiency. The practical applications of the proposed meminductor include advanced uses in developing leaky integrate and fire neuron. Additionally, we successfully fabricated the first physical meminductor emulator chip, which occupies a die area of 2032.7 $\\mu$ m $^{2}$ using a 180 nm CMOS process. The integration of these fabrication results helps corroborate the theoretical derivations presented. This convergence of practical fabrication and theoretical insight signifies a major leap in meminductor technology, hinting at wide-ranging future applications in electronic systems.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential in addressing intricate control and decision problems such as vehicle tracking control and obstacle avoidance. Nonetheless, the control policies acquired through RL often lack smoothness even in the presence of minor noises or disturbances, which may induce oscillations, overheating, and even damage to the system in real-world applications. Existing methods handle this issue from temporal or spatial domains and are often tightly coupled with specific tasks. This paper studies the smoothness of control policy from the frequency domain perspective. We propose a class of neural networks with low-pass filtering ability, named Smonet, to alleviate the non-smooth issue by learning a low-frequency representation within hidden layers. Smonet features with serial filtering layers responsible for low-pass filtering of the input signal. Each filtering layer contains multiple inertia cells, one adaptive cell, and one activation layer. To facilitate the filtering ability of Smonet, we further proposed a Smonet-based RL training method by integrating an extra regularization term relating to filtering factors to standard RL loss. Finally, we assess the efficacy of Smonet through diverse simulated robot control tasks and a real-world mobile robot obstacle avoidance experiment, comparing its performance with two commonly utilized networks, multi-layer perceptron and gated recurrent unit. Results indicate that Smonet consistently enhances policy smoothness under various observation noises without compromising control performance. Notably, it achieves up to a 72.7% reduction in the action fluctuation ratio compared to traditional network structures.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor network plays a crucial role in sensing everything in Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. Network reliability, which measures the ability of the network to satisfy specific requirements, is one of the core factors influencing the quality of service of the network and a vital support for ensuring the normal operation of IoE applications. Existing reliability evaluation methods are mainly based on minimum cutsets or paths, which are inefficient and not suitable for large-scale networks. Furthermore, most work either focuses on coverage functionality or connectivity functionality, lacking energy awareness. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional Target Full-Coverage Reliability (TFCR). TFCR comprehensively considers various factors affecting network reliability. To evaluate TFCR, a graph-empowered CIC and Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR)-based Energy-aware Reliability Algorithm (CSERA) is proposed. This algorithm evaluates network coverage based on the confident information coverage (CIC) model. Additionally, graph neural networks and the SINR-based Fade Tail Connectivity (FTC) model are used to evaluate network connectivity functionality. CSERA balances computational accuracy and efficiency, providing reliability evaluation values within an acceptable margin of error. Extensive simulations and comparative experiments from multiple perspectives demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method CSERA over existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been widely used for privacy-preserving model updates in Industry 5.0, facilitated by 6G networks. Despite FLâs privacy-preserving advantages, it remains vulnerable to attacks where adversaries can infer private data from local models or manipulate the central server (CS) to deliver falsified global models. Current privacy-preserving approaches, primarily based on the FedAvg algorithm, fail to optimize training efficiency for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This article proposes training-efficient and verifiable aggregation (TEVA) for FL to resolve these issues. This scheme combines threshold Paillier homomorphic encryption (TPHE), verifiable aggregation, and an optimized double momentum update mechanism (OdMum). TEVA not only leverages TPHE to protect the privacy of local models but also ensures the integrity of the global model through a verifiable aggregation mechanism. Additionally, TEVA integrates the OdMum algorithm to effectively address the challenges posed by non-IID data, promoting rapid model convergence and significantly enhancing overall training efficiency. Security analysis indicates that TEVA meets the requirements for privacy protection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that TEVA can accelerate model convergence while incurring lower computational and communication overheads.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e. , LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts.",

    "abstract": "Containers have emerged as a pivotal tool for service deployment in edge computing. Before running the container, an image composed of several layers must exist locally. Recent strategies have utilized layer-sharing in images to reduce deployment delays. However, existing research only focuses on a single aspect of container orchestration, like container placement, neglecting the joint optimization of the entire orchestration process. To fill in such gaps, this paper introduces an online strategy that considers layer-aware container orchestration, encompassing request scheduling, container placement, and resource provision. The goal is to reduce costs, adapt to evolving user demands, and adhere to system constraints. We present an online optimization problem that accounts for various real-world factors in orchestration, including container and server expenses. An online algorithm is proposed, integrating a regularization-based approach and stepwise rounding to address this optimization problem efficiently. The regularization approach separates time-dependent container placement and server wake-up costs, requiring only current information and past decisions. The stepwise rounding process generates feasible solutions that meet system constraints, reducing computational costs. Additionally, a competitive ratio proof is provided for the proposed algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves about 20% performance enhancement compared to baseline algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In pixel-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL), learning representations of states that change because of an agentâs action or interaction with the environment poses a critical challenge in improving data efficiency. Recent data-efficient DRL studies have integrated DRL with self-supervised learning (SSL) and data augmentation to learn state representations from given interactions. However, some methods have difficulties in explicitly capturing evolving state representations or in selecting data augmentations for appropriate reward signals. Our goal is to explicitly learn the inherent dynamics that change with an agentâs intervention and interaction with the environment. We propose masked and inverse dynamics modeling (MIND), which uses masking augmentation and fewer hyperparameters to learn agent-controllable representations in changing states. Our method is comprised of a self-supervised multitask learning that leverages a transformer architecture, which captures the spatiotemporal information underlying in the highly correlated consecutive frames. MIND uses two tasks to perform self-supervised multitask learning: masked modeling and inverse dynamics modeling. Masked modeling learns the static visual representation required for control in the state, and inverse dynamics modeling learns the rapidly evolving state representation with agent intervention. By integrating inverse dynamics modeling as a complementary component to masked modeling, our method effectively learns evolving state representations. We evaluate our method by using discrete and continuous control environments with limited interactions. MIND outperforms previous methods across benchmarks and significantly improves data efficiency.

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents, mostly caused by human errors, pose a significant challenge in automotive safety. This paper introduces TUN-DAS, a novel Time-series analysis and Unsupervised learning-based Driving behavior Assessment System, designed to systematically evaluate driversâ behavior and identify potential risks. Unlike conventional in-cabin driver monitoring systems, which generally rely on rule-based or supervised methods, TUN-DAS utilizes a unique time-series clustering approach. This method combines a\nk\n-means algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA), enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of driving behavior. The modification of conventional DTW in our system allows for effective computation of temporal differences between driving data. TUN-DAS stands out in its ability to detect both sporadic human errors and consistent unsafe driving patterns by analyzing anomalies within individual drivers and across a broader driver dataset. Our validation with bus driver data shows TUN-DASâs effectiveness in driving behavior assessment, significantly achieving better accuracy than traditional rule-based evaluation methods and allowing for quantitative and temporal analysis of a series of driving behavior. This system holds promise for enhancing road safety by facilitating the early identification of high-risk drivers, thereby contributing to the development of safer driving environments.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel framework named double-latent optimization for representation disentanglement (D-LORD), which is designed for motion stylization (motion style transfer and motion retargeting). The primary objective of this framework is to separate the class and content information from a given motion sequence using a data-driven latent optimization approach. Here, class refers to person-specific style, such as a particular emotion or an individualâs identity, while content relates to the style-agnostic aspect of an action, such as walking or jumping, as universally understood concepts. The key advantage of D-LORD is its ability to perform style transfer without needing paired motion data. Instead, it utilizes class and content labels during the latent optimization process. By disentangling the representation, the framework enables the transformation of one motion sequenceâs style to anotherâs style using adaptive instance normalization. The proposed D-LORD framework is designed with a focus on generalization, allowing it to handle different class and content labels for various applications. In addition, it can generate diverse motion sequences when specific class and content labels are provided. The frameworkâs efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on three datasets: 1) the CMU XIA dataset for motion style transfer; 2) the multimodal human action database dataset; and 3) the RRIS Ability dataset for motion retargeting. Notably, this article presents the first generalized framework for motion style transfer and motion retargeting, showcasing its potential contributions in this area.",

    "abstract": "To empower the management of smart metersâ demand load within a smart grid environment, this paper presents a Feed-forward Neural Network with ADaptive Evolutionary Learning Approach (ADELA). In this model, the load forecasting information is propagated via neurons of input and multiple hidden layers and the final estimated output is achieved with the help of the sigmoid activation function. An improved evolutionary algorithm is proposed for training and adjusting the interconnecting weights among the layers of the intended neural network. This model is capable of addressing the critical challenges of high volatility, uncertainty, missing smart meters data, and sudden upsurge and plunge in electricity demand. The proposed algorithm is able to learn the best suitable evolutionary operators from a given pool of operators and the probabilities associated with them. The proposed load forecasting approach is simulated over three real-world smart meter datasets, including the Australian Smart Grid Smart City project, the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation, and UMass Smart. The performance evaluation and comparison of the proposed approach with the existing state-of-the-art approaches revealed a relative improvement of up to 46.93%, 5.05%, and 2.20% in forecast accuracy over the Smart Grid Smart City, UMass Smart and the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for analyzing graph-structural data and solving graph-related tasks due to their powerful expressiveness. However, existing off-the-shelf GNN-based models usually consist of no more than three layers. Deeper GNNs usually suffer from severe performance degradation due to several issues including the infamous âover-smoothingâ issue, which restricts the further development of GNNs. In this article, we investigate the over-smoothing issue in deep GNNs. We discover that over-smoothing not only results in indistinguishable embeddings of graph nodes, but also alters and even corrupts their semantic structures, dubbed semantic over-smoothing. Existing techniques, e.g., graph normalization, aim at handling the former concern, but neglect the importance of preserving the semantic structures in the spatial domain, which hinders the further improvement of model performance. To alleviate the concern, we propose a cluster-keeping sparse aggregation strategy to preserve the semantic structure of embeddings in deep GNNs (especially for spatial GNNs). Particularly, our strategy heuristically redistributes the extent of aggregations for all the nodes from layers, instead of aggregating them equally, so that it enables aggregate concise yet meaningful information for deep layers. Without any bells and whistles, it can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play structure of GNNs via weighted residual connections. Last, we analyze the over-smoothing issue on the GNNs with weighted residual structures and conduct experiments to demonstrate the performance comparable to the state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Sensory information recognition is primarily processed through the ventral and dorsal visual pathways in the primate brain visual system, which exhibits layered feature representations bearing a strong resemblance to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), encompassing reconstruction and classification. However, existing studies often treat these pathways as distinct entities, focusing individually on pattern reconstruction or classification tasks, overlooking a key feature of biological neurons, the fundamental units for neural computation of visual sensory information. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a unified framework for sensory information recognition with augmented spikes. By integrating pattern reconstruction and classification within a single framework, our approach not only accurately reconstructs multimodal sensory information but also provides precise classification through definitive labeling. Experimental evaluations conducted on various datasets including video scenes, static images, dynamic auditory scenes, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activities demonstrate that our framework delivers state-of-the-art pattern reconstruction quality and classification accuracy. The proposed framework enhances the biological realism of multimodal pattern recognition models, offering insights into how the primate brain visual system effectively accomplishes the reconstruction and classification tasks through the integration of ventral and dorsal pathways.",

    "abstract": "Most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods are limited in the scale of problems they can handle. With increasing numbers of agents, the number of training iterations required to find the optimal behaviors increases exponentially due to the exponentially growing joint state and action spaces. This paper tackles this limitation by introducing a scalable MARL method called Distributed multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors (DARL1N). DARL1N is an off-policy actor-critic method that addresses the curse of dimensionality by restricting information exchanges among the agents to one-hop neighbors when representing value and policy functions. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, significantly reducing the learning complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying neighbor numbers and states. This structure allows us to formulate a distributed learning framework to further speed up the training procedure. Distributed computing systems, however, contain straggler compute nodes, which are slow or unresponsive due to communication bottlenecks, software or hardware problems. To mitigate the detrimental straggler effect, we introduce a novel coded distributed learning architecture, which leverages coding theory to improve the resilience of the learning system to stragglers. Comprehensive experiments show that DARL1N significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality and is scalable as the number of agents increases. Moreover, the coded distributed learning architecture improves training efficiency in the presence of stragglers.",

    "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (CT) images often suffer from noise and artifacts from photon starvation and electronic noise. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) techniques have significantly improved outcomes in low-dose CT imaging. However, many existing methods require costly low-dose/high-dose CT image pairs for supervised training, which is difficult to obtain in clinical. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach for low-dose CT sinogram recovery based on the noise generation mechanism within the Bayes framework. Specifically, we introduce a novel formulation of sinogram recovery model based on the noise generating mechanism without additional regularization terms. Then, we design an efficient algorithm that utilizes Bayes rules to solve the sinogram recovery model, offering approximate and analytical solutions for all decomposed score functions. Instead of relying on deep network priors, we adopt an implicit diffusion model to characterize the common latent prior of sinogram data and enable the iterative algorithm more efficient and interpretable. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over competing techniques in both denoising and generalization performance.",

    "abstract": "The surge in mobile vehicles and data traffic in Vehicular Edge Computing and Networks (VECONs) requires innovative approaches for low latency, stable connectivity, and efficient resource usage in fast-moving vehicles. Existing studies have identified that utilizing digital twins (DTs) can effectively improve service quality in VECONs. However, it still faces substantial challenges posed by large-scale complex DT communications in sustaining real-time collaborative endeavors. In particular, within the dynamic VECONs, the decision regarding DT migration plays a pivotal role in sustaining the quality of services. In this paper, we propose an adaptive DT migration (ADM) algorithm to minimize the overall migration costs when DTs deliver services. Specifically, 1) We formulate ADM as a combinatorial optimization problem in VECONs, comprehensively considering communication latency and migration latency under complex DT communications, vehicular mobilities, and dynamic states of edges; 2) An ADM algorithm based on off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning is proposed to make migration decisions. Moreover, the ADM agent employs warm-up policies to address exploration challenges in sparse state spaces; 3) Simulations based on real-world, large-scale urban vehicular mobility datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing algorithms by approximately 39% on average, and it can achieve results close to the optimal.",

We first construct these representations and their stable inverses in the contraction framework and then provide a parametrization of stabilizing controllers by additionally assuming incremental input-to-state stability for the image representation. Focusing on constant metrics results in a parametrization of all stabilizing controllers rendering the closed-loop systems IES with respect to constant metrics if an observer having the same dimension as a system can be designed. After that, we revisit the presented image and kernel representations from the variational viewpoint and show that their variational systems are respectively image and kernel representations for the variational systems of the original nonlinear systems. Finally, we interpret the proposed controller parameterization in terms of the Youla-KucËera parametrization for variational systems.",

    "abstract": "Various network compression methods, such as pruning and quantization, have been proposed to synergistically reduce resource requirements. However, existing joint compression works are based on black-box optimization and do not interpret the interaction mechanism between these two compression techniques, leading to a slow and unstable convergence of compression strategy. To address this issue, we present Markov-PQ, the first interpretable pruning-quantization co-compression framework using a Markov Chain. In Markov-PQ, the joint strategy search is modeled as a Markov Chain and decoupled with Bayes Rule into pruning and quantization strategy searching. Specifically, the quantization state accounts for the co-compression state from the last time and is updated by a learnable transition probability matrix. To ensure differentiability, we design a forward-hard and backward-soft quantization. The pruning state is influenced not only by the last co-compression state but also by the concurrent quantization state. In addition, to perceive the current layer-wise bit sensitivity and alleviate the long-tail problem, a complexity-aware regularizer is devised to re-evaluate the filter importance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Markov-PQ. For example, with an accuracy loss of only 0.33%, we can achieve a 56.12Ã acceleration for ResNet-18 on ImageNet2012.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS) has led to unprecedented advancements in mobility and efficiency. However, ensuring the safety and reliability of these complex systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in verifying and refining their temporal behaviors. This paper presents a novel compositional approach for temporal behavior analysis and synthesis in safety-critical T-CPS, the safety-critical temporal analysis, and refinement for the T-CPS (STAR-TCPS) framework, which combines iterative compositional verification with L $^\u0007st$ -based learning techniques to analyze and refine timing behaviors efficiently. The method leverages the clock constraint specification language for high-level timing specifications and introduces a systematic refinement process to transform abstract requirements into implementable task models. The framework incorporates innovative constraint handling mechanisms tailored for T-CPS, addressing unique challenges such as vehicle-to-infrastructure communication delays and adaptive traffic management timing. Experimental evaluations, including a case study on an intelligent vehicle system, demonstrate STAR-TCPSâs superiority over existing methods. Results show significant improvements in verification time (up to 63% reduction), memory usage (44% decrease), and task generation efficiency (18-25% fewer tasks) compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The STAR-TCPS framework enhances T-CPSâs safety and reliability by enabling more efficient verification and refinement of critical timing properties, paving the way for safer and more robust transportation systems.",

    "abstract": "With the growing memory requirements of modern data-intensive applications for high performance and large capacity, building hybrid memory systems with different memory technologies has become a dominant trend to satisfy these demands. For better system performance, frequently accessed hot data is fetched into the fast and capacity-limited near memory (NM) while cold data is evicted to the slow and large far memory (FM). In prior works, NM is used as a cache of FM (cNM), part of OS-visible memory (mNM), and a fixed capacity of cNM and mNM. This paper presents Phoenix, a novel hybrid memory architecture that harnesses the advantages of both cNM and mNM. The ratio of cNM to mNM is adjustable during runtime to better exploit both temporal and spatial locality benefits for different memory access patterns. All cNM and mNM space is multiplexed to mitigate the data movement overhead for the mode switch between cNM and mNM. In our evaluations, Phoenix outperforms state-of-the-art designs by an average of 18.2% and consumes orders of magnitude less metadata storage space.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can extract the tissue conductivity values from in vivo data using the so-called phase-based magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MR-EPT). However, this procedure suffers from noise amplification caused by the use of the Laplacian operator. To counter this issue, we propose a novel preprocessing denoiser for magnetic resonance transceive phase images, operating in an unsupervised manner. Inspired by the deep image prior approach, we apply the random initialization of a convolutional neural network, which enforces an implicit regularization. Additionally, we introduce Stein's unbiased risk estimator, which is the unbiased estimator of the mean square error for optimizing the network without the need for label images. This modification not only tackles the overfitting problem inherent in the deep image prior approach but also operates within a purely unsupervised framework. In addition, instead of using phase images, we use real and imaginary images, which aligns with the theoretical model of the risk estimator. Our generative model needs neither the preparation of training datasets nor prior training procedure, and it maintains adaptability across various resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio levels. In testing. our method significantly diminished residual error remaining in phase maps, quantitatively as well as qualitatively, for both phantom and simulated brain data. Furthermore, it outperformed other denoising methods in reducing noise amplification and boundary error. When applied to healthy volunteer and patient data, the proposed method revealed reduced error in the reconstructed conductivity maps, with conductivity values aligning well with established literature values. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first blind approach using a purely unsupervised denoising framework that can implement a 2D phase-based MR-EPT reconstruction algorithm.

    "abstract": "This article presents a 3.96-\nÎ¼\nm, 640\nÃ\n640 pixel stacked digital pixel sensor capable of capturing co-located monochrome (MONO) and near-infrared (NIR) frames simultaneously in a dual-channel global shutter (GS) operation. A super-pixel structure is proposed with diagonally arranged 2\nÃ\n2 MONO and NIR sub-pixels. To enhance visible light sensitivity, large and small non-uniform micro-lenses are formed on the MONO and NIR sub-pixels, respectively. Each floating diffusion (FD) shared super-pixel is connected to an in-pixel analog-to-digital converter and two banks of 10-bit static random access memories (SRAMs) to enable the dual-channel GS operation. To achieve high dynamic range (DR) in the MONO channel, a triple-quantization (3Q) operation is performed. Furthermore, a single-channel digital-correlated double sampling (D-CDS) 3Q operation is implemented. The fabricated sensor achieved 6.2-mW low power consumption at 30 frames/s with dual-channel capture. The MONO channel achieved 124-dB DR in the 3Q operation and 60 dB for the NIR channel. The sensor fits the stringent form-factor requirement of an augmented reality headset by consolidating MONO and NIR imaging capabilities.",

    "abstract": "The lack of complete labels and data heterogeneity are obstacles to the application of artificial intelligence-based methods in industrial scenarios, such as machinery fault diagnosis. To address these challenges, this article proposes a federated learning (FL) framework for the industrial Internet of Things based on bidirectional knowledge distillation (KD) and hard sample selection. In the framework, the cloud server provides a pretrained deep learning (DL) model based on the cross-domain public dataset to facilitate the cold start in real-world applications. Then during the training process, each participating factory trains its heterogeneous local DL model according to local data volume and computing resources. Bidirectional KD with feature maps and hard sample selection is then carried out on a shared dataset between the server and factories to share knowledge efficiently. Moreover, all the DL models used in the application of the proposed framework are designed based on expertise and attention mechanism to diagnose multiple types of machinery and faults. Case studies using the vibration data collected from multiple factories show that the proposed framework improves the fault diagnosis accuracy compared to other FL methods while significantly reducing communication overhead.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for machine intelligence is to learn new visual concepts without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Continual learning (CL) is aimed toward addressing this challenge. However, there still exists a gap between CL and human learning. In particular, humans are able to continually learn from the samples associated with known or unknown labels in their daily lives, whereas existing CL and semi-supervised CL (SSCL) methods assume that the training samples are associated with known labels. Specifically, we are interested in two questions: 1) how to utilize unrelated unlabeled data for the SSCL task and 2) how unlabeled data affect learning and catastrophic forgetting in the CL task. To explore these issues, we formulate a new SSCL method, which can be generically applied to existing CL models. Furthermore, we propose a novel gradient learner to learn from labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. In this way, the unlabeled data can fit into the supervised CL framework. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on mainstream CL methods, adversarial CL (ACL), and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification accuracy and backward transfer (BWT) in the CL setting while achieving the desired performance on classification accuracy in the SSL setting. This implies that the unlabeled images can enhance the generalizability of CL models on the predictive ability of unseen data and significantly alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for global search, using maximum a posteriori updates instead of simulated annealing. We cast it as a multi-armed bandit problem with a Gaussian process (GP) for the payoff function. Action selections rely on upper confidence bound (UCB) or expected improvement (EI). Prior works with GPs faced challenges for large iteration horizons ( T ) due to cubic scaling in posterior computation. To address this, we propose a simple thresholding: incorporating an action into the GP posterior only when its conditional entropy surpasses Ïµ . Doing so permits us to precisely characterize the tradeoff between regret bounds of GP bandit algorithms and complexity of the posterior distributions depending on the compression parameter Ïµ for both discrete and continuous action sets. To best of our knowledge, this is the first result which allows us to obtain sublinear regret bounds while still maintaining sublinear growth rate of the complexity of the posterior ...",

    "abstract": "3D semantic occupancy has garnered considerable attention due to its abundant structural information encompassing the entire autonomous driving scene. However, existing 3D occupancy prediction methods are typically tailored for single-frame inputs, resulting in unsatisfactory performance and temporal inconsistencies in real-world continuous scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LinkOcc, a sparse-queries approach incorporating an efficient temporal association mechanism for 3D semantic occupancy prediction. LinkOcc is conceptually built on the prevalent DETR-like framework for 2D segmentation, and we further construct the temporal association mechanism on this basis. Specifically, we propose a near-online training strategy that jointly trains with two adjacent frames, which successfully combines the benefits of both online and off-online methods. Moreover, we introduce a temporal association strategy with contrastive learning to discriminate features for cross-frame semantic-level association. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LinkOcc not only surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in 3D occupancy prediction, but also guarantees a promising performance on foreground classes.",

    "abstract": "This study revisits the fuzzy control system design problem with the motto âFuzzy with Conventional Controlâ, inspired by L.A. Zadehâs statement in the famous debate âSome Crisp Thoughts on the Fuzzy versus Conventional Control.â Focused on single-input (SI) fuzzy PIDs (FPIDs), our approach synergizes fuzzy and conventional control, presenting similar control laws to PID and fuzzy gain-scheduled (FGS) PID. Departing from traditional fuzzy control paradigms, our design methodology enhances, rather than replaces, PID controllers with fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). We start by analyzing the internal structure of both type-1 and type-2 SI-FPIDs and commenting on their structural properties. We address the high-design complexity of FLCs by proposing an interpretable and geometrical design method that explicitly shapes fuzzy mapping (FM) according to the desired control characteristics. To provide self-tuning (ST) capability to the FPID, like the FGS-PID, we develop ST mechanisms that adapt the FM of SI-FPID according to the operating point via the derived insights. Real-world application in speed control for an industrial permanent magnet synchronous machine validates the efficacy of our designs, showcasing improved disturbance rejection and reduced control signal variation compared to FGS-PIDs and PID. This research advocates for the wider adoption of SI-FPID as a practical enhancement to PID in industrial applications, offering design simplicity and ST capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Conventional security architectures and models are considered single-network architecture solutions, which assume that devices authenticated within the network are implicitly trusted. However, such an approach is unsuitable for next-generation networks (NGNs). Zero-trust security was introduced to overcome these challenges using context-aware, dynamic, and intelligent authentication schemes. This paper proposes a novel zero-trust blockchain-enabled framework for secure next-generation healthcare communication network (HCN). The proposed framework integrates zero-trust and blockchain to provide a decentralized, secure, and intelligent solution for healthcare communication in NGNs. The system model comprises three components: HCN user identity modeling, blockchain and risk assessment-based access control, and dynamic trust gateway. The user identity modeling component utilizes attribute-based user behavior trajectory features, while the access control component leverages smart contracts-based risk assessment. The dynamic trust gateway component employs a consensus mechanism to achieve dynamic gateway switching and enhance network resilience. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 31% lower calculation delays, 3% higher trust values, and 3% better attack detection accuracy compared to best baseline methods. It also exhibits a 2% improvement in access control granularity and maintains 95% network throughput under various failure scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript introduces an efficient resource allocation framework for a transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (T-RIS) assisted Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system under residual hardware impairments (RHIs) resulting from imperfect transceiver hardware design. In particular, the goal is to maximize the sum rate of the considered multi-cluster based T-RIS assisted LEO-satellite NOMA network. This is achieved by optimizing the power-allocation of users, time-allocation for each cluster, and transmit passive beamforming of T-RIS node, while adhering to quality-of-service (QoS), time-allocation, and power-budget constraints. Moreover, the presented optimization algorithm tackles the considered highly non-convex problem in three steps. Firstly, the power-allocation of NOMA users is computed by exploiting Lagrange duality and sub-gradient methods. Secondly, the time-allocation for each cluster is determined based on the interior point method by exploiting Mosek-assisted CVX toolbox. Thirdly, the computation of passive beamforming employs semi-definite programming (SDP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, where a rank-1 solution is achieved by incorporating the Gaussian randomization method. Finally, numerical simulations affirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy, highlighting its superior performance in comparison to benchmark techniques. Notably, it proves to be highly effective in achieving fast convergence with only a few iterations.",

    "abstract": "Music as an emotional intervention media has important applications in scenarios such as music therapy, games, and movies. However, music needs real-time arrangement according to changing emotions, bringing challenges to balance emotion real-time fit and soft emotion transition due to the fine-grained and mutable nature of the target emotion. Existing studies mainly focus on achieving emotion real-time fit, while the issue of smooth transition remains understudied, affecting the overall emotional coherence of the music. In this paper, we propose REMAST to address this trade-off. Specifically, we recognize the last timestep's music emotion and fuse it with the current timestep's input emotion. The fused emotion then guides REMAST to generate the music based on the input melody. To adjust music similarity and emotion real-time fit flexibly, we downsample the original melody and feed it into the generation model. Furthermore, we design four music theory features by domain knowledge to enhance emotion information and employ semi-supervised learning to mitigate the subjective bias introduced by manual dataset annotation. According to the evaluation results, REMAST surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in objective and subjective metrics. These results demonstrate that REMAST achieves realtime fit and smooth transition simultaneously, enhancing the coherence of the generated music",

    "abstract": "Intelligent connected vehicles integrate smart systems and network communication to enhance safety and efficiency, making them widely applicable for formation control in diverse scenarios. Current mainstream methods typically split formation control tasks into independent functional modules and establish relationships for transmitting information, which results in a fixed number of vehicles in the fleet and limited flexibility in formation configurations. In this paper, we propose a cooperative integrated decision and control (CIDC) framework for formation control in diverse scenarios. This framework splits the driving task into three modules: static trajectory planning, order allocation, and dynamic optimal tracking. First, in the static trajectory planning module, static traffic elements are considered to generate a set of candidate trajectories, freeing up higher-level constraints and enhancing trajectory planning efficiency. Second, in the order allocation module, reasonable and safety preceding vehicles for following are selected, determining the configuration of the connected vehicle fleet in real-time. Finally, in the dynamic optimal tracking module, a multi-objective optimal tracking problem is designed to track the optimal path while considering dynamic obstacles, thereby improving vehicle autonomy and achieving cooperative formation control with variable vehicle numbers and flexible formation configurations. Simulation and real vehicle experiment results demonstrate that the proposed CIDC framework can achieve automatic formation adjustment, making it suitable for various formation control tasks such as convoy driving, deliver and platoon driving",

    "abstract": "In the era of data information explosion, there are different observations on an object (e.g., the height of the Himalayas) from different sources on the web, social sensing, crowd sensing, and data sensing applications. Observations from different sources on an object can conflict with each other due to errors, missing records, typos, outdated data, etc. How to discover truth facts for objects from various sources is essential and urgent. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive and exhaustive survey on truth discovery problems from the perspectives of concepts, methods, applications, and opportunities. We first systematically review and compare problems from objects, sources, and observations. Based on these problem properties, different methods are analyzed and compared in depth from observation with single or multiple values, independent or dependent sources, static or dynamic sources, and supervised or unsupervised learning, followed by the surveyed applications in various scenarios. For future studies in truth discovery fields, we summarize the code sources and datasets used in above methods. Finally, we point out the potential challenges and opportunities on truth discovery, with the goal of shedding light and promoting further investigation in this area.",

    "abstract": "The perception of autonomous vehicles has to be efficient, robust, and cost-effective. However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations. Our method leverages lower-level radar data (the radar cube) instead of the processed point clouds to preserve as much information as possible and employs projections in both the camera and ground planes to effectively use radars with elevation information and simplify the fusion with camera data. As a result, DPFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar dataset while showing remarkable robustness against adverse weather conditions and maintaining a low inference time. The code is made available as open-source software under https://github.com/TUMFTM/DPFT .",

    "abstract": "Recently, group activity recognition (GAR) has drawn growing interests in video analysis and computer vision communities. The current models of GAR tasks are often impractical in that they suppose that all interactions between actors are pairwise, which only models and leverages part of the information in real entire interactions. Motivated by this, we design a distinct dynamical attention hypergraph convolutional network framework, referred to as DAHGCN, for precise GAR, modeling the entire interactions and capturing the high-order relationships among involved actors in a real-life scenario. Specifically, to learn complementary feature representations for fine-grained GAR, a multilevel feature descriptor (MLFD) module is proposed. Furthermore, for learning higher order interaction relationships, we construct a DAHGCN to accommodate complex group interactions, which can dynamically change the topology of the hypergraph and learn these key representations by virtue of the âsimilarity-based shared nearest-neighbor (SSNN) clusteringâ and âattention mechanismsâ on hypergraph. Finally, a multiscale temporal convolution (MSTC) module is utilized to explore various long-range temporal dynamic correlations across different frames. In addition, comprehensive experiments on three commonly used GAR datasets clearly demonstrate that, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method can achieve the most optimal performance.",

    "abstract": "As synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging technology continues to evolve, the growing repository of SAR images depicting diverse types of observed targets has sparked rising interest in SAR target incremental recognition techniques. However, most existing SAR target incremental recognition algorithms typically require an ample amount of training data. In urgent scenarios such as emergency response and disaster relief, there may be a necessity to identify targets for which a substantial amount of data has not been previously accumulated. Algorithms designed for general scenarios often fail to achieve satisfactory performance in such situations. To tackle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a few-shot incremental recognition algorithm for SAR targets based on orthogonal distributed features. Specifically, an orthogonal distribution optimization method for features is designed, which not only mitigates the feature confusion in few-shot incremental learning, but also reserves space for features of potential unseen classes. A random augmentation method for high-dimensional features is proposed to improve the overfitting problem while assisting in strengthening the boundaries between features of different classes. Furthermore, a joint decision criterion based on Euclidean distance and cosine distance is introduced, enabling the classifier to possess sufficient generalization ability and robustness in handling dynamic data. Experimental results on the MSTAR dataset show that the algorithm outlined in this paper outperforms existing methods in SAR target few-shot incremental recognition tasks, demonstrating its superior effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in examining and diagnosing prostate diseases due to its high resolution. However, the diverse morphology of prostate tissue presents a significant challenge for precise gland segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated effectiveness in segmenting prostate regions. Nevertheless, their limited capability in extracting global long-range semantic features often leads to unstable network segmentation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Transformer-based Vnet framework (DT-VNet), which consists of a symmetric encoder-decoder architecture that explores global contextual features and retains local feature information. To effectively learn global and local features, We propose the Deep Union Transformer (DU-Trans) as an encoding base module for capturing comprehensive information. Additionally, we introduce a Pool Fusion Attention (PFA) module for decoding, which emphasizes learning context dependencies and interaction relationships. PFA can also facilitate the fusion of deep and shallow features. To our knowledge, this is the first study about deep transformer-based Vnet framework for prostate segmentation. We validate and compare our method on several public datasets against current state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in segmenting 3D prostate MRI.",

    "abstract": "The trace of double compression can serve as a crucial evidence of image manipulation for forensic investigation. With the ever-increasing popularity of WebP format, a new type of double compression case, WebP-JPEG transcoding, has emerged. However, distinguishing it from two common compression cases, single JPEG (SJPEG) and double JPEG (DJPEG) has not yet been studied. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for the new task. Firstly, a detailed analysis is conducted to reveal the differences in compression artifacts between WebP-JPEG and SJPEG/DJPEG, which manifests in the distributions of 4Ã4 / 8Ã8 DCT coefficients and the high-frequency portions of image spectrum. Then, multi-modality DCT histograms (MMDH) and high-pass-filtered image residuals (HPFIR) are proposed as front-end dual-domain forensic features to expose the above differences. An indispensable part of these features are extracted through a novel frequency-isolation module (FIM), offering additional information based on the derived relationship between 4Ã4 and 8Ã8 DCT coefficients. Finally, a CNN-ViT (Convolutional Neural Network-Vision Transformer) dual-stream network is designed to learn back-end deep features for a reliable detection, where a CNN stream is used to process statistical features in MMDH while a ViT stream to learn spatial correlations in HPFIR. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art double compression detection methods in distinguishing WebP-JPEG from SJPEG/DJPEG and is more effective in tampering localization. In specific, the proposed method achieves an average detection accuracy of 0.942 for small images of size 128Ã128.",

    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning (PFL) is a popular distributed learning framework that allows clients to have different models and has many applications where clientsâ data are in different domains, including autonomous driving, traffic surveillance, and medical diagnosis. The typical model of a client in PFL features a global encoder trained by all clients to extract universal features from the raw data and personalized layers (e.g., a classifier) trained using the clientâs local data. Nonetheless, due to the differences between the data distributions of different clients (also known as, domain gaps), the universal features produced by the global encoder largely encompass numerous components irrelevant to a certain clientâs local task. Some recent PFL methods address the above problem by personalizing specific parameters within the encoder. However, these methods encounter substantial challenges attributed to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of neural network parameter space. In contrast, the feature space exhibits a lower dimensionality, providing greater intuitiveness and interpretability as compared to the parameter space. To this end, we propose a novel PFL framework named FedPick. FedPick achieves PFL within the low-dimensional feature space by adaptively selecting task-relevant features for each client from the features generated by the global encoder based on its local data distribution. It presents a more accessible and interpretable implementation of PFL compared to those methods working in the parameter space. Extensive experimental results on multiple cross-domain datasets show that FedPick can effectively select task-relevant features for each client and improve model performance in cross-domain FL.",

    "abstract": "Numerous autonomous driving systems employ deep learning-based image object detection schemes for their navigation. For developing reliable autonomous driving systems, the training process of the deep image object detectors must be performed in a precise manner. Existence of samples with erroneous labels, e.g., erroneous bounding boxes, in the training datasets of autonomous driving systems leads to a reduction in their performance and a decrease in their reliability in real-life situations. Given these explanations, in this paper, we propose a novel erroneous bounding box detection scheme for identifying the bounding boxes in the training datasets that are annotated wrongly, and avoid their use in the training process of autonomous driving systems. Specifically, we employ two efficient techniques, namely, multi-modal information processing and confident learning, in the development of the proposed scheme. In the multi-modal information processing, we first obtain the instance segmentation maps of the images using deep image instance segmentation networks, and then, utilize their interactions with the spatial coordinates of the bounding boxes, along with the spatial coordinates themselves, to generate discriminative sets of features for the task of erroneous bounding box detection. Further, by using the confident learning technique, we leverage the statistical information of the estimated erroneous statuses of the bounding boxes, to further enhance the performance of the task of erroneous bounding box detection. The results of extensive experimentations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed erroneous bounding box detection scheme in cleaning the datasets of autonomous driving systems, compared to the state-of-the-art data selection schemes.",

    "abstract": "Formally verifying logic-optimized integer multipliers remains a crucial yet insufficiently addressed problem in both industry and academia, presenting significant verification challenges, particularly when verifying large-scale logic-optimized multipliers with diverse architectures. Satisfiability (SAT)-based methods require structurally similar and known correct reference multipliers, which may not always be readily accessible. Symbolic Computer Algebra (SCA) techniques can verify multipliers without references but encounter difficulties with optimized multipliers due to unclear adder boundaries. To enable effective formal verification of optimized multipliers, we propose the RefSCAT framework, which contains a reference multiplier generator that produces references structurally similar to the optimized multiplier with clear adder boundaries, enabling a synergistic SCA-SAT verification flow. First, we propose a reverse engineering algorithm that extracts the essential adder tree from the optimized multiplier, ensuring similarity. Second, since only a partial netlist is extractable after optimization, we propose a constraint satisfaction algorithm to complete the generation using only adders while following the extracted netlist, ensuring both similarity and clear adder boundaries. Third, leveraging the generated reference, we propose a synergized SCA-SAT verification flow that verifies the generated reference using SCA and then uses it as a correct reference for SAT-based verification. The experiments demonstrate that RefSCAT can successfully verify logic-optimized multipliers with diverse partial-product-based architectures up to 128 bits, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by verifying at least 29% more benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Neural network adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) is developed in this article to treat strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown state delays and input saturation. These delays are treated by constructing the LyapunovâKrasovskii (LâK) functions for each subsystem. A command filter is employed to avoid the derivative explosion caused by continuous differentiation of the virtual controller. Corresponding auxiliary systems are designed and integrated into the backstepping procedure to compensate input saturation and the unimplemented part of the filter. Hyperbolic tangent functions and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to treat singularity and related unknown terms, respectively. The convergence of the resultant strict-feedback systems is ensured in the framework of composite energy function (CEF). Finally, a simulation example is adopted to substantiate the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Data visualization in the form of charts plays a pivotal role in data analysis, offering critical insights and aiding in informed decision- making. Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant ad- vancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper aims to provide valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) is the gold standard for monitoring heart function and is crucial for preventing the worsening of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the inconvenience of ECG acquisition poses challenges for long-term continuous monitoring. Consequently, researchers have explored non-invasive and easily accessible photoplethysmography (PPG) as an alternative, converting it into ECG. Previous studies have focused on peaks or simple mapping to generate ECG, ignoring the inherent periodicity of cardiovascular signals. This results in an inability to accurately extract physiological information during the cycle, thus compromising the generated ECG signals' clinical utility. To this end, we introduce a novel PPG-to-ECG translation model called CATransformer, capable of adaptive modeling based on the cardiac cycle. Specifically, CATransformer automatically extracts the cycle using a cycle-aware module and creates multiple semantic views of the cardiac cycle. It leverages a transformer to capture detailed features within each cycle and the dynamics across cycles. Our method outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting the lowest RMSE across five paired PPG-ECG databases. Additionally, extensive experiments are conducted on four cardiovascular-related tasks to assess the clinical utility of the generated ECG, achieving consistent state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results confirm that CATransformer generates highly faithful ECG signals while preserving their physiological characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are gradually becoming the technological changemakers in cancer diagnosis. Blood cancer is an aggressive disease affecting the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic system, and its early detection is crucial for subsequent treatment. Flow cytometry has been widely studied as a commonly used method for detecting blood cancer. However, the high computation and resource consumption severely limit its practical application, especifically in regions with limited medical and computational resources. In this study, with the help of cloud computing and IoT technologies, we develop a novel blood cancer dynamic monitoring diagnostic model named BloodPatrol based on an intelligent feature weight fusion mechanism. The proposed model is capable of capturing the dual-view importance relationship between cell samples and features, greatly improving prediction accuracy and significantly surpassing previous models. Besides, benefiting from the powerful processing ability of cloud computing, BloodPatrol can run on a distributed network to efficiently process large-scale cell data, which provides immediate and scalable blood cancer diagnostic services. We have also created a cloud diagnostic platform to facilitate access to our work, the latest access link and updates are available at: https://github.com/kkkayle/BloodPatrol .",

    "abstract": "Wearable robots have gained attention as a promising technology for enhancing human functions and capabilities. While early research focused on developing motorized exoskeletons, recent efforts have shifted toward improving wearability for user convenience. However, the size and weight of actuators and battery components in active wearable robots remain significant challenges. As an alternative, passive wearable robots using nonmotorized mechanical components are lightweight and energy-efficient, but they have limitations in adapting to different situations. This article introduces a self-unlocking active clutch (SuAC) for quasi-passive wearable robots, which combines the benefits of both active and passive systems. The SuAC utilizes a shape memory alloy coil spring and an encoder to actively lock and provide assistive force based on the user's movement. Once in a locked state, the clutch can automatically unlock when the assistive force falls below a certain threshold, based on the user's preprogrammed intentions. This self-unlocking feature eliminates the need for additional mechanical triggering components or external sensors. The SuAC weighs approximately 50 grams and can withstand a locking torque of over 500 N, with a fast response time of less than 0.15 s. To demonstrate its application, we applied the SuAC to a neck-assist exosuit, showing that the assistive force can be controlled solely by the user's movements. This research simplifies the design and expands the functionality of quasi-passive wearable robots, providing a more accessible and efficient solution for assistive technology.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to leverage additional semantic information to recognize unseen classes. To transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes, most ZSL methods often learn a shared embedding space by simply aligning visual embeddings with semantic prototypes. However, methods trained under this paradigm often struggle to learn robust embedding space because they align the two modalities in an isolated manner among classes, which ignore the crucial class relationship during the alignment process. To address the aforementioned challenges, this article proposes a visualâsemantic graph matching net (VSGMN), which leverages semantic relationships among classes to aid in visualâsemantic embedding. VSGMN uses a graph build net (GBN) and a graph matching net (GMN) to achieve two-stage visualâsemantic alignment. Specifically, GBN first uses an embedding-based approach to build visual and semantic graphs in the semantic space and align the embedding with its prototype for first-stage alignment. In addition, to supplement unseen class relationships in these graphs, GBN also builds the unseen class nodes based on semantic relationships. In the second stage, GMN continuously integrates neighbor and cross-graph information into the constructed graph nodes and aligns the node relationships between the two graphs under the class relationship constraint. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSGMN achieves superior performance in both conventional and generalized ZSL (GZSL) scenarios. The implementation of our VSGMN and experimental results are available at github: https://github.com/dbwfd/VSGMN.",

Since optical signals can only be transmitted via line-of-sight paths, UAVs are employed to forward data from a base station (BS) to remote users for urgent tasks using multi-hop mixed FSO/RF links. The UAVs employ the decode and forward protocol to relay data. The last UAV decodes and forwards the data to multiple users through RF links using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To improve fairness, a modified deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is used to optimize the transmit power allocation in real-time to minimize the maximum user decoding outage probability.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) and semantic segmentation with image-level annotations have attracted extensive attention due to their high label efficiency. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a feasible solution for the two tasks by treating each image as a bag with a series of instances (object regions or pixels) and identifying foreground instances that contribute to bag classification. However, conventional MIL paradigms often suffer from issues, e.g., discriminative instance domination and missing instances. In this article, we observe that negative instances usually contain valuable deterministic information, which is the key to solving the two issues. Motivated by this, we propose a novel MIL paradigm based on negative deterministic information (NDI), termed NDI-MIL, which is based on two core designs with a progressive relation: NDI collection and negative contrastive learning (NCL). In NDI collection, we identify and distill NDI from negative instances online by a dynamic feature bank. The collected NDI is then utilized in a NCL mechanism to locate and punish those discriminative regions, by which the discriminative instance domination and missing instances issues are effectively addressed, leading to improved object-and pixel-level localization accuracy and completeness. In addition, we design an NDI-guided instance selection (NGIS) strategy to further enhance the systematic performance. Experimental results on several public benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO, show that our method achieves satisfactory performance.
