        "abstract": "The pursuit of refined data analysis and the preservation of privacy in Big Data pose significant concerns. Among the paramount paradigms for addressing these challenges, differential privacy stands out as a vital area of research. However, traditional differential privacy tends to be excessively restrictive when it comes to individuals' control over their own data. It often treats all data as inherently sensitive, whereas in reality, not all information related to individuals is sensitive and requires an identical level of protection. In this paper, we define secret specification-based differential privacy (SSDP), where the term âsecret specificationâ implies enabling users to decide what aspects of their information are sensitive and what are not, prior to data generation or processing. By allowing individuals to independently define their secret specifications, the SSDP achieves personalized privacy protection and facilitates effective data analysis. To enable the targeted application of SSDP, we further present task-specific mechanisms designed for database and graph data scenarios. Finally, we assess the trade-offs between privacy and utility inherent in the proposed mechanisms through comparative experiments conducted on real datasets, demonstrating the utility enhancements offered by SSDP mechanisms in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "As the healthcare industry has continued to develop and the medical data becomes digitized, the risk of data leakage from attacks grows. All medical data is encrypted and stored to prevent data leakage, but from big data perspective, it is inefficient because the encryption of this medical data lowers the big data processing performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes an Anonymity-based Big Data Management (ABDM) for protecting healthcare data from privacy breach without compromising on performance. The idea of ABDM is to separate and store identity data and healthcare data in databases on different cloud servers. By storing the identity data and healthcare data separately in databases on different cloud servers, hackers are unable to identify whose healthcare data is obtained until they obtain both the identity data and healthcare data. Through experiments in a public cloud, ABDM outperforms existing healthcare data management systems by two times speed.",

        "abstract": "Deep-learning-based human activity recognition (HAR) methods have significantly transformed a wide range of domains over recent years. However, the adoption of Big Data techniques in industrial applications remains challenging due to issues such as generalized weight optimization, diverse viewpoints, and the complex spatiotemporal features of videos. To address these challenges, this work presents an industrial HAR framework consisting of two main phases. First, a squeeze bottleneck attention block (SBAB) is introduced to enhance the learning capabilities of the backbone model for contextual learning, which allows for the selection and refinement of an optimal feature vector. In the second phase, we propose an effective sequential temporal convolution network (STCN), which is designed in parallel fashion to mitigate the issues of exploding and vanishing gradients associated with sequence learning. The high-dimensional spatiotemporal feature vectors from the STCN undergo further refinement through our proposed SBAB in a sequential manner, to optimize the features for HAR and enhance the overall performance. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through extensive experiments on six datasets, including data from industrial and general activities.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain enhances the security and interoperability of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems by serving as a secure and decentralized platform for data sharing. The rapid growth of IoV data makes it challenging to store the entire blockchain on edge nodes with limited storage resources due to the blockchainâs immutability. Redactable blockchain represents a potential solution for enabling the controlled modification of data on blocks. However, current redactable blockchain schemes suffer from high computational overhead and lack support for stateful redaction and consistency checking. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient decentralized chameleon hash scheme (CHSTS) based on Schnorr threshold signatures. CHSTS allows t-out-of-n edge nodes to collaborate with the transaction proposer to compute chameleon hash collisions, enabling modification and deletion of block data without breaking the hash links between the blocks. We then construct a redactable blockchain utilizing CHSTS to alleviate the storage limitations of edge nodes. To ensure consistency checking and stateful redaction of the redactable blockchain, we design a novel modification verification mechanism based on vector commitments. Finally, we provide detailed security analysis of the CHSTS scheme and integrate the proposed scheme into Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the redactable blockchain through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that our scheme incurs less computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art chameleon hash schemes. Furthermore, our scheme maintains close efficiency compared to immutable blockchain, incurring negligible storage overhead.",

        "abstract": "Time series are often complex and rich in information but sparsely labeled and therefore challenging to model. Existing contrastive learning methods conduct augmentations and maximize their similarity. However, they ignore the similarity of adjacent timestamps and suffer from the problem of sampling bias. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning generalizable representations of time series, called\nR\nanking n\nE\nighborhood and cla\nS\ns prototyp\nE\ncontr\nA\nstive\nL\nearning (RESEAL). It exploits information about similarity ranking to learn an embedding space, ensuring that positive samples are ranked according to their temporal order. Additionally, RESEAL introduces a class prototype contrastive learning module. It contrasts time series representations and their corresponding centroids as positives against truly negative pairs from different clusters, mitigating the sampling bias issue. Extensive experiments conducted on several multivariate and univariate time series tasks (i.e., classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting) demonstrate that our representation framework achieves significant improvement over existing baselines of self-supervised time series representation",

        "abstract": "Trajectory clustering is a cornerstone task in the field of trajectory mining. With the proliferation of deep learning, deep trajectory clustering has been widely researched to mine mobility patterns from massive unlabeled trajectories. Nevertheless, existing methods mostly ignore trajectories' temporal regularities, which are essential for mining fine-grained mobility patterns for applications including traveling group identification, transportation mode discovering, social security emergency, etc. To fill this gap, we propose ConDTC, a contrastive deep trajectory clustering method targeting for fine-grained mobility pattern mining. Specifically, we first design a spatial-temporal trajectory representation learning method which can capture both spatial and temporal regularities of trajectories synchronously. The proposed trajectory representation model can be used as a pre-trained model to serve various downstream trajectory mining tasks. Then, we construct a contrastive trajectory clustering module which optimizes trajectory representations and clustering performance simultaneously. Experimental results on three datasets validate that ConDTC can identify fine-grained mobility patterns by clustering trajectories with similar spatial-temporal mobility patterns together while separating those with different mobility patterns apart. Actually, ConDTC outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of Big data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices, there is an increasing need to leverage its potential while protecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality. Privacy and confidentiality in big data aims to enable data analysis and machine learning on large-scale datasets without compromising the dataset sensitive information. Usually current big data analytics models either efficiently achieves privacy or confidentiality. In this article, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled secured collaborative machine learning approach that provides privacy and confidentially on large scale datasets generated by IoT devices. Blockchain is used as secured platform to store and access data as well as to provide immutability and traceability. We also propose an efficient approach to obtain robust machine learning model through use of cryptographic techniques and differential privacy in which the data among involved parties is shared in a secured way while maintaining privacy and confidentiality of the data. The experimental evaluation along with security and performance analysis show that the proposed approach provides accuracy and scalability without compromising the privacy and security.",

        "abstract": "Voronoi diagram is commonly used to visualize geographical point dataset with a collection of plane-partitioned facets. As the size of the geographical point dataset increases, facets are densely distributed, and present different sizes and irregular shapes, leading to overdrawing and confusion problems, and hampering the visual perception of Voronoi diagram and insightful exploration of geographical point data. In this paper, we propose a novel Voronoi diagram generation framework to visualize and explore large-scale geographical point datasets. Firstly, an attribute-based blue noise sampling model is designed to select a subset of points to generate the simplified Voronoi diagram, retaining both the spatial distribution and attribute relationship of the original large-scale geographical points. Then a couple of optimization schemes are integrated into the sampling model to replace the representative points, aiming to enhance the visual perception of Voronoi diagram, such as shape balance and color characterization. Furthermore, we implement an interactive online Voronoi diagram generation tool, GeoVoronoi, enabling users to generate meaningful facets according to their requirements. Quantitative comparisons, case studies and user studies based on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in the generation of credible Voronoi diagram and in-depth exploration of geographical point datasets.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology makes it possible to design robust decentralized federated learning (FL). Minimizing the communication cost and storage consumption incurred is one of the essential challenges. In addition, maintaining the security and privacy of Big Data raises to be a difficult problem. Aiming to tackle these challenges, this paper presents LBFL (a Lightweight Blockchain-based FL framework) that offers three novel features. First, it employs a new committee consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Contribution, which is used to avoid the selection latency from the competition of miners and alleviate the congestion in cross-validation of parameters in an asynchronous fashion. Second, LBFL employs a role-adaptive incentive mechanism to estimate devices' workloads and identify malicious nodes effectively. Third, to cope with the excessive storage overheads incurred in full-replication, LBFL applies a new storage partition mechanism that distributes triple redundant chunks in ReedSolomon coding (RSC) evenly to participating devices with high fault tolerance and recovery efficiency. To evaluate LBFL, empirical studies are performed on the famous MNIST dataset and LBFL is compared with the state-of-the-art FL frameworks. The results demonstrate that LBFL can reduce evaluation latency and storage consumption by 69.2% and 72.1%, respectively, and the learning efficiency of LBFL is higher than the state-ofthe-art methods. In particular, important findings are obtained: the proposed role-adaptive incentive mechanism can properly identify malicious devices and switch the roles of legitimate devices to achieve good decentralization",

        "abstract": "Multi-label stream classification aims to address the challenge of dynamically assigning multiple labels to sequentially-arrived instances. In real situations, only partial labels of instances can be observed due to the expensive human annotations, and the problem of label distribution changes arises from multiple labels in a streaming mode, but few existing works jointly consider such challenges. Motivated by this, we propose the problem of weak multi-label stream classification (WMSC) and an online classification algorithm robust to weak labels. Specifically, we incrementally update the margin-based model using information from both the past model and the current incoming instance with partially observed labels. To increase the robustness to weak labels, we first adjust the classification margin of negative labels using the label causality matrix, which is constructed by the conditional probability of label pairs. Secondly, we introduce the label prototype matrix to regulate the margin by controlling the weighting parameter of the slack term. Additionally, to handle the potential distribution changes in labels, we utilize the instance-specific threshold via online thresholding to perform binary classification, which is formulated as a regression problem. Finally, theoretical analysis and empirical experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of WMSC in classifying unobserved streaming instances.",

        "abstract": "This research provides an in-depth exploration of the intersection of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data (CAB) across six sectors in manufacturing and public service. It highlights the transformative potential of these technologies in reshaping industries and enhancing efficiency while also underscoring the challenges they present, particularly in data protection and privacy. To put these challenges in context, a security model consisting of three dimensions (security goal, security control, and data state) is developed and applied to six sectors. The resultant models represent a major step toward more effective risk assessment in practice. They should also inspire research efforts to further advance CAB more effectively and responsibly.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at understanding heterogeneous information networks (HINs) and have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, previous works tend to study small datasets, which deviate significantly from real-world scenarios. More specifically, their heterogeneous message passing results in substantial memory and time overheads, as it requires aggregating heterogeneous neighbor features multiple times. To address this, we propose an Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (EHGNN) that leverages heterogeneous personalized PageRank (HPPR) to preserve the influence between all nodes, then approximates message passing and selectively loads neighbor information for one aggregation, significantly reducing memory and time usage. In addition, we employ some lightweight techniques to ensure the performance of EHGNN. Evaluations on various HIN benchmarks in node classification and link prediction tasks unequivocally establish the superiority of EHGNN, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 11 $\\%$ in terms of performance. In addition, EHGNN achieves a remarkable 400 $\\%$ boost in training and inference speed while utilizing less memory. Notably, EHGNN can handle a 200-million-node, 1-billion-link HIN within 18 hours on a single machine, using only 170GB of memory, which is much lower than the previous minimum requirement of 600 GB. Our code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/EHGNN .",

        "abstract": "Gearboxes are widely used in various types of mechanical equipment and have become an essential part of connecting various components in the machine and transmitting power. A fault in the gearbox will cause the entire mechanical equipment to stop working, causing economic losses and safety hazards. Previous fault diagnosis models for gearbox used the vibration signals of the gearbox as input features. They designed a variety of feature extraction modules to learn the information contained in the vibration signals. However, the latent features learned by previous models have poor interpretability and robustness, thus affecting model performance. In addition, the prediction results of previous fault diagnosis models used for gearbox using single-scale features are often less robust. Moreover, the fault diagnosis models used for gearbox are usually end-to-end black box models, which cannot provide interpretive information about the predicted values, and it is difficult to handle the uncertain information in the vibration signals. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale fuzzy variational autoencoder (MFVAE) using a fuzzy neural network for Big Data-based fault diagnosis in gearbox. The Big Data technology can automatically collect vibration signals from sensors and provide high-quality training samples for fault diagnosis models. The MFVAE model first uses two variational autoencoders of different sizes to extract the latent features of the gearbox vibration signal. Subsequently, the MFVAE model fuses low-level latent features and high-level latent features in proportion to form the final head features, which are used to diagnose gearbox faults. Finally, the MFVAE model inputs the head features into the prediction layer to diagnose the fault of the gearbox. The prediction layer comprises a fully connected network and a fuzzy neural network. Experimental results on the real gearbox dataset verify the outstanding performance of the MFVAE model.",

        "abstract": "A data publishing deal conducted with anonymous microdata can preserve the privacy of people. However, anonymizing data with multiple records of an individual (1:M dataset) is still a challenging problem. After anonymizing the 1:M microdata, the vertical correlation can be exploited to launch privacy attacks. In this paper, a novel privacy preserving model lc, ls-ANGEL is proposed. To validate the new model, two privacy attacks are presented, namely, a Vertical correlation attack (Vc0) and a Vulnerable sensitive attribute attack (Vsa) on 1:M datasets, which breach the privacy of individuals. Furthermore, the proposed model is examined through High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs). Our experiments on three real-world datasets;âINFORMSâ,âYOUTUBEâ, and âIMDbâ demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Our practices and lessons learned in this work can direct future concrete steps towards Multiple Sensitive Attributes, where we can expand the proposed model to dynamic datasets",

        "abstract": "It is a challenging task to select the informative features that can maintain the manifold structure in the original feature space. Many unsupervised feature selection methods still suffer the poor cluster performance in the selected feature subset. To tackle this problem, a feature subspace learning-based binary differential evolution algorithm is proposed for unsupervised feature selection. Firstly, a new unsupervised feature selection framework based on evolutionary computation is designed, in which the feature subspace learning and the population search mechanism are combined into a unified unsupervised feature selection. Secondly, a local manifold structure learning strategy and a sample pseudo-label learning strategy are presented to calculate the importance of the selected feature subspace. Thirdly, the binary differential evolution algorithm is developed to optimize the selected feature subspace, in which the binary information migration mutation operator and the adaptive crossover operator are designed to promote the searching for the global optimal feature subspace. Experimental results on various types of realworld datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain more informative feature subset and competitive cluster performance compared with eight state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.",

        "abstract": "In the era of Big Data, artificial intelligence and information science are the key technologies to extract the value of data and enhance the competitiveness of enterprises. The characteristics of distributed, small-scale, and sparse lead to the isolated data island problem. To solve these problems, Federated Learning is proposed. However, a large number of terminal models need to be uploaded to the server in Federated Learning, especially for the actual scenario of Internet of Things. Therefore, huge communication costs are required which dramatically increases the pressure on the backbone network. Furthermore, the low quality of the local model will lead to decreased accuracy and convergence rates of the model. To overcome the above limitations, we propose heterogeneous device collaboration based federated learning (HDCFL), which constructs a three-layer structure for Federated Learning by leveraging edge computing and designs a heterogeneous device collaboration method that groups the terminals based on their computing power, communication time, and data volume to train the model. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm which verifies its advantage. At last, the experimental result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm consistently achieves superior performance in terms of both convergence speed and accuracy compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Data quality is a fundamental challenge for downstream data mining tasks. While numerous studies have addressed data quality issues in various contexts, there is a notable lack of systematic research on data quality in metro systems. Metro systems generate a vast volume of multisource heterogeneous datasets daily, and many data mining tasks have been developed for operational and management purposes. Therefore, investigating data quality problems in metro systems is crucial. In this paper, we systematically explore data quality issues in metro systems. First, we present a comprehensive analysis method to examine data quality problems such as missing data, noise, and weak semantics. Second, we design five metrics to measure data quality and propose a set of quality improvement approaches. These approaches include a travel pattern-based missing value imputation method, a heuristic trajectory noise filtering method, and a data semantics enhancement method. Additionally, we develop an automated pipeline solution where the data quality enhancement algorithms are seamlessly integrated with the data processing pipeline. Finally, we provide a case study to illustrate the significant benefits of our data quality improvement methods. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our methods on a set of large-scale dataset collected from a metro system, which includes smart card data, Wi-Fi signal data, and electronic fence data. The results indicate that (1) the proposed imputation method surpasses other baselines by 26.47% to 44.82%; (2) the proposed noise filtering method outperforms other baselines by an average of 12.22%; and (3) the proposed data semantics enrichment method exceeds the baseline method by 37.34% in terms of maximum accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Anomalies within data flows in the Internet of Things environment can potentially result in security vulnerabilities in consumer electronics. Therefore, it is crucial to effectively detect anomaly data to safeguard the reliability and continuous functionality of consumer electronics. Existing related works either learn from unlabeled data using unsupervised methods or leverage the limited labeled data to improve detection performance by semi-supervised methods. However, these methods usually overfit specific types of known anomalies or ignore the uncertainty when model training. To this end, we design a novel approach to jointly optimize the end-to-end detection of labeled and unlabeled anomalies. Specifically, the anomaly data detection problem investigated is first reformulated as a Markov decision process. Then, a partially labeled anomaly data detection approach (PANDA) based on prioritized deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed, which considers uncertainty when the agent makes decisions and can learn from the labeled known anomalies while continuously exploring and detecting prospective anomalies in unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 13 datasets show that PANDA improves the AUC-ROC and AUC-PR by 3.0%-10.3% and 10.0%-73.5% and its robustness under the impact of anomaly contamination rates compared with four state-of-the-art competing methods.",

        "abstract": "While deep learning techniques have shown promising performance in the Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) detection task, they still face limitations in real-world scenarios. Specifically, given the data scarcity, some efforts have resorted to aggregating data from different domains to expand the data volume. However, their effectiveness is currently limited by the domain gap and data privacy. Additionally, the class imbalance issue is particularly severe in our application, leading to biased classifying performance accordingly. To address these challenges, we propose Data-Free Domain Incremental Learning for the MDD detection (DIL-MDD) task, accommodating multiple feature distributions by only accessing well-trained models from previous domains and the data in the current domain. Specifically, DIL-MDD consists of two key modules: Adaptive Class-tailored Threshold Learning (ACTL) and Data-Free Domain Alignment (DFDA). The first module measures the discrepancy between the outputs of two sequential domains, based on which we learn a class-tailored threshold adaptively. Building on this, we differentiate between samples that either exhibit similarities or dissimilarities with the previous domain, where this similar sample set is identified to investigate the feature distribution of the historical data. The second module imposes an alignment constraint to narrow the gap between these two sample sets, thereby exploring the expertise of the previous domain. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the public MDD datasets, i.e. , DAIC-WOZ, MODMA, and CMDC. We also apply our method to another mental health condition, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), to further demonstrate its applicability. Finally, the ablation studies validate the superiority of the proposed modules.",

        "abstract": "The publicly released machine learning (ML) models are susceptible to malicious attacks ( e.g. , gradient leakage attacks), which may expose sensitive training data of data-sharing platforms to untrusted third-parties. To preserve the privacy of training data, differential privacy (DP) is exploited to limit the amount of leaked privacy with a predefined budget, which in fact is a non-recoverable resource. Considering DP, allocating privacy budgets to ML queries is a non-trivial but crucial problem because a certain amount of non-recoverable privacy budget will be consumed if a datablock is assigned to a query once. Meanwhile, both datablocks and ML queries are continuously generated, which further complicates the problem. Most existing works simply relied on greedy-based algorithms to make myopic allocation decisions, far away from the optimal decision. In this paper, we propose a novel H istory-aware P rivacy B udget A llocation (HPBA) algorithm for data-sharing platforms to address the above challenges. Different from existing works, HPBA leverages historical query records to approximate global ML query patterns so as to overcome the drawback of shortsighted greedy-based algorithms. Moreover, the performance of HPBA is theoretically guaranteed by competitive analysis. A lightweight version called S-HPBA is proposed to further reduce computation overhead by using fewer historical records. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, HPBA and S-HPBA improve the average performance by 32.8% and 16.2% in terms of model accuracy, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The burgeoning complexity of communication necessitates a high demand for security. Access control encryption is a promising primitive to meet the security demand but the bulk of its constructions rely on formulating the access control policy with identities. Attribute-based access control policy in attribute-based encryption (ABE) is known to be more expressive without relying on enumerating identities. We propose a generic framework to build attribute-based access control encryption from ciphertext-policy ABE. Our instantiations prioritize different emphases on expressiveness and efficiency. The first instantiation supports multi-valued AND-gate access control structures, while the second supports the linear-secret-sharing access structure. Both are prototyped with efficiency validated empirically.",

        "abstract": "Firms need to continuously carry out product innovation to survive in dynamic market. In the big data environment, most firms, especially internet firms, realize new product innovation by taking imitation innovation as a stepping stone leading to independent innovation. Knowledge transfer, one of the main methods that firms acquire knowledge from external environment for imitation innovation, is a complex process of multiple knowledge transfer among different organizations and subject to various risks. Thus, it is necessary to understand knowledge transfer risks in the big data environment and help firms to carry out effective knowledge transfer in the process of new product innovation. Based on the influence factors of knowledge transfer risks and development process of innovation, a theoretical framework for risk control of knowledge transfer in the big data environment is proposed and a risk control model of knowledge transfer is presented. The model can be used to determine the maximum profit of a new product, the optimal time of knowledge transfer, and the update time of independent innovation knowledge in the big data environment. The results of simulation experiments are in line with the actual economic situation, and the model is valid.",

        "abstract": "In order to improve the data quality, the big data cleaning method of distribution network was studied in this paper. First, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm based on DBSCAN clustering was used to detect outliers. However, due to the difficulty in determining the LOF threshold, a method of dynamically calculating the threshold based on the transformer districts and time was proposed. Besides, the LOF algorithm combines the statistical distribution method to reduce the \"misjudgment rate\". Aiming at the diversity and complexity of data missing forms in power big data, this paper improved the Random Forest imputation algorithm, which can be applied to various forms of missing data, especially the blocked missing data and even some horizontal or vertical data completely missing. The data in this paper were from real data of 44 transformer districts of a certain 10kV line in distribution network. Experimental results showed that outlier detection was accurate and suitable for any shape and multidimensional power big data. The improved Random Forest imputation algorithm was suitable for all missing forms, with higher imputation accuracy and better model stability. By comparing the network loss prediction between the data using this data cleaning method and the data removing outliers and missing values, it was found that the accuracy of network loss prediction had been improved by nearly 4 percentage points using the data cleaning method mentioned in this paper. Additionally, as the proportion of bad data increased, the difference between the prediction accuracy of cleaned data and that of uncleaned data was greater.",

The rapid growth and spread of social media websites provide an information-rich channel from which tourism researchers and managers can collect a large amount of text-based reviews or comments and photos relating to the past travel experiences of users. The travel photos with geographic information are especially helpful in identifying the geographical location of the destinations. By analyzing these big data in various formats can help to understand the interests of tourists at destinations. In this paper, a framework is proposed to identify the interests of tourists by integrating information carried by the geotagged photos shared on social media websites. Such an approach is expected to provide sustainable tracking on popular places of interest (POIs) updated by tourists and pick the best representative photos taken by them. The performance of this model is evaluated by conducting a case study using the geotagged photos taken in Hong Kong. A case study proved this proposed framework could make a thriving tourism in...",

        "abstract": "Granular-ball support vector machine (GBSVM) is a significant attempt to construct a classifier using the coarse-to-fine granularity of a granular ball as input, rather than a single data point. It is the first classifier whose input contains no points. However, the existing model has some errors, and its dual model has not been derived. As a result, the current algorithm cannot be implemented or applied. To address these problems, we fix the errors of the original model of the existing GBSVM and derive its dual model. Furthermore, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed to solve the dual problem. The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm is also carefully designed to solve the dual problem. The latter is faster and more stable. The experimental results on the UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate that GBSVM is more robust and efficient. All codes have been released in the open source library available at: http://www.cquptshuyinxia.com/GBSVM.html or https://github.com/syxiaa/GBSVM.",

        "abstract": "Distributed cloud technologies enable mobile healthcare applications to support end users constantly. Data from electronic health records is made available through combination of user needs and heuristic mining. Because of inefficient data storage and reorganization, service and recommendation failures occur prematurely. A Distributed Data Analytics and Organization Model (DDAOM) is established in this article as a solution to the inefficiency of managing large amounts of data. Using this method, errors caused by performing several computations or storing large amounts of data in the medical field are minimized. Data organization and mining under predetermined schedules or factors provide information relevant to user services. One-to-many computations with varying input and output data allocations (for services) are executed in federated learning. The local input from several edges may be handled by allocating storage in a decentralized manner. The federated learning system uses the memory of past states to direct the allocation. Differentiating the states is necessary to allocate services and prevent mining in certain areas. With the help of realistic learning iterations, state management is maintained, guaranteeing the smooth deployment of services. Delays in storage and mining, uneven service provisioning, and service backlogs are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested model.",

        "abstract": "Acquiring big-size datasets to raise the performance of deep models has become one of the most critical problems in representation learning (RL) techniques, which is the core potential of the emerging paradigm of federated learning (FL). However, most current FL models concentrate on seeking an identical model for isolated clients and thus fail to make full use of the data specificity between clients. To enhance the classification performance of each client, this study introduces the FDRL, a federated discriminative RL model, by partitioning the data features of each client into a global subspace and a local subspace. More specifically, FDRL learns the global representation for federated communication between those isolated clients, which is to capture common features from all protected datasets via model sharing, and local representations for personalization in each client, which is to preserve specific features of clients via model differentiating. Toward this goal, FDRL in each client trains a shared submodel for federated communication and, meanwhile, a not-shared submodel for locality preservation, in which the two models partition client-feature space by maximizing their differences, followed by a linear model fed with combined features for image classification. The proposed model is implemented with neural networks and optimized in an iterative manner between the server of computing the global model and the clients of learning the local classifiers. Thanks to the powerful capability of local feature preservation, FDRL leads to more discriminative data representations than the compared FL models. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our FDRL benefits from the subspace partition and achieves better performance on federated image classification than the state-of-the-art FL models.",

        "abstract": "Due to operating condition drift, environmental changes, and system oscillations, industrial processes often exhibit nonstationary characteristics that involve both stable long-term trend and fluctuant short-term dynamics. In this article, a novel multiscale gated structure model (MGSM) is proposed for nonstationary process soft sensing, which includes long-term memory chain (stable and low frequency) and short-term dynamic chain (respond to fluctuations). The information decomposed from input data is introduced into the MGSM to learn long-term dependency relationships and dynamic behavior in the nonstationary process. In addition, a novel two-dimensional random missing function is designed to handle randomly missing data, which fully considers the data missing in variable-wise and time-wise dimensions. The proposed model is further constructed for the soft sensing of nonstationary processes with random missing data.

        "abstract": "Active learning, as a technique, aims to effectively label specific data points while operating within a designated query budget. Nevertheless, the majority of unsupervised active learning algorithms are based on shallow linear representation and lack sufficient interpretability. Furthermore, certain diversity-based methods face challenges in selecting samples that adequately represent the entire data distribution. Inspired by these reasons, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised active learning method on orthogonal projections to construct a deep neural network model. By optimizing the orthogonal projection process, we establish the connection between projection and active learning, consequently enhancing the interpretability of the proposed method. The proposed method can efficiently project the feature space onto a spanned subspace, deriving an indicator matrix while calculating the projection loss. Moreover, we consider the redundancy among samples to ensure both data point diversity and enhancement of clustering-based algorithms. Through extensive comparative experiments on six public datasets, the results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively select more informative and representative samples and improve performance by up to 11%.",

        "abstract": "Pawlak rough set (PRS) and neighborhood rough set (NRS) are the two most common rough set theoretical models. Although the PRS can use equivalence classes to represent knowledge, it is unable to process continuous data. On the other hand, NRSs, which can process continuous data, rather lose the ability of using equivalence classes to represent knowledge. To remedy this deficit, this article presents a granular-ball rough set (GBRS) based on the granular-ball computing combining the robustness and the adaptability of the granular-ball computing. The GBRS can simultaneously represent both the PRS and the NRS, enabling it not only to be able to deal with continuous data and to use equivalence classes for knowledge representation as well. In addition, we propose an implementation algorithm of the GBRS by introducing the positive region of GBRS into the PRS framework. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the learning accuracy of the GBRS has been significantly improved compared with the PRS and the traditional NRS. The GBRS also outperforms nine popular or the state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

        "abstract": "Few-shot object detection achieves rapid detection of novel-class objects by training detectors with a minimal number of novel-class annotated instances. Transfer learning-based few-shot object detection methods have shown better performance compared to other methods such as meta-learning. However, when training with base-class data, the model may gradually bias towards learning the characteristics of each category in the base-class data, which could result in a decrease in learning ability during fine-tuning on novel classes, and further overfitting due to data scarcity. In this paper, we first find that the generalization performance of the base-class model has a significant impact on novel class detection performance and proposes a generalization feature extraction network framework to address this issue. This framework perturbs the base model during training to encourage it to learn generalization features and solves the impact of changes in object shape and size on overall detection performance, improving the generalization performance of the base model. Additionally, we propose a feature-level data augmentation method based on self-distillation to further enhance the overall generalization ability of the model. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, with a 6.94% improvement on the PASCAL VOC 10-shot dataset.",

        "abstract": "Recently, data has ousted oil as the most economical resource in the world, but most companies are reluctant to share customer/user data in pure form and on a large scale due to privacy concerns. Many innovative technologies (e.g., federated learning, split learning) are employed to meet the growing demand for privacy preservation. Despite these technologies, acquiring personal data in order to optimize utility, and then sharing it on a large scale, is still very challenging. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), a relatively new and promising solution to resolve these challenges is to generate synthetic data (SD) by mirroring the original dataset's properties. SD is a promising solution to address growing privacy demands as well as the utility/analytics requirements of many industry stakeholders. In this paper, we propose and implement an SD generation method from a real dataset containing both numerical and categorical attributes by using an improved conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN), and we quantify the feasibility of SD on technical and theoretical grounds. We provide a detailed analysis of SD in original and anonymized forms with the help of multiple use cases, whereas prior research simply assumed that privacy issues in SD are small because AI models do not overfit or SD has a poor connection with real data. We provide insights into the characteristics of SD (distributions, value frequencies, correlations, etc.) produced by the CGAN in relation to the real data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that provides an experiment-based analysis of the quality, privacy, and utility of SD in relation to a real benchmark dataset",

        "abstract": "As a promising distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) involves training deep neural network (DNN) models at the network edge while protecting the privacy of the edge clients. To train a large-scale DNN model, batch normalization (BN) has been regarded as a simple and effective means to accelerate the training and improve the generalization capability. However, recent findings indicate that BN can significantly impair the performance of FL in the presence of non-i.i.d. data. While several FL algorithms have been proposed to address this issue, their performance still falls significantly when compared to the centralized scheme. Furthermore, none of them have provided a theoretical explanation of how the BN damages the FL convergence. In this article, we present the first convergence analysis to show that under the non-i.i.d. data, the mismatch between the local and global statistical parameters in BN causes the gradient deviation between the local and global models, which, as a result, slows down and biases the FL convergence. In view of this, we develop a new FL algorithm that is tailored to BN, called FedTAN, which is capable of achieving robust FL performance under a variety of data distributions via iterative layer-wise parameter aggregation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FedTAN over existing baselines for training BN-based DNN models.",

        "abstract": "Local differential privacy (LDP) techniques obviate the need for trust in the data collector, as they provide robust privacy guarantees against untrusted data managers while simultaneously preserving the accuracy of statistical information derived from the privatized data. As a result, these methods have garnered considerable interest and research efforts. In particular, (Îµ,Î´)-LDP schemes have been utilized across a range of statistical tasks. Nonetheless, existing (Îµ,Î´)-LDP mechanisms for mean estimation suffer from challenges such as elevated estimation errors and diminished data utility. To address this problem, we propose two novel (Îµ,Î´)-LDP algorithms for mean estimation. Specifically, we design a one-dimensional piecewise mean estimation algorithm, which perturbs the input data into intervals, thereby reducing noise addition and enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. Building on this foundation, we extend our approach to multi-dimensional data, resulting in a multi-dimensional piecewise mean estimation algorithm. Furthermore, we conduct a theoretical analysis to derive both the variance and error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the high practicality of our algorithms for data statistical tasks, showing significant improvements in data utility.",

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), multiple parties collaborate to train a global model by aggregating their local models while keeping private training sets isolated. One problem hindering effective model aggregation is data heterogeneity. Federated ensemble distillation tackles this problem by using fused local-model knowledge to train the global model rather than directly averaging model parameters. However, most existing methods fuse all knowledge indiscriminately, which makes the global model inherit some data-heterogeneity-caused flaws from local models. While knowledge filtering is a potential coping method, its implementation in FL is challenging due to the lack of public data for knowledge validation. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-free approach (FedKFD) that synthesizes credible labeled data to support knowledge filtering and distillation. Specifically, we construct a prediction capability description to characterize the samples where a local model makes correct predictions. FedKFD explores the intersection of local-model-input space and prediction capability descriptions with a conditional generator to synthesize consensus-labeled proxy data. With these labeled data, we filter for relevant local-model knowledge and further train a robust global model through distillation. The theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves improved generalization, superior performance, and compatibility with other FL efforts.",

        "abstract": "Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes the homogeneity of models, necessitating clients to expose their model parameters to enhance the performance of the server model. However, this assumption cannot reflect real-world scenarios. Sharing models and parameters raises security concerns for users, and solely focusing on the server-side model neglects clientsâ personalization requirements, potentially impeding expected performance improvements of users. On the other hand, prioritizing personalization may compromise the generalization of the server model, thereby hindering extensive knowledge migration. To address these challenges, we put forth an important problem: How can FL ensure both generalization and personalization when clientsâ models are heterogeneous? In this work, we introduce FedTED, which leverages a twin-branch structure and data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) to address the challenges posed by model heterogeneity and diverse objectives in FL. The employed techniques in FedTED yield significant improvements in both personalization and generalization, while effectively coordinating the updating process of clientsâ heterogeneous models and successfully reconstructing a satisfactory global model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FedTED outperforms many representative algorithms, particularly in scenarios where clientsâ models are heterogeneous, achieving a remarkable 19.37% enhancement in generalization performance and up to 9.76% improvement in personalization performance.",

        "abstract": "Cold-start recommendation is a long-standing challenge when presenting potential preferred items to new users. Most empirical studies leverage side information to promote cold-start recommendation. In this work, we focus on cross-domain cold-start recommendation, which aims to provide suggestions to those non-overlapping users who have only interacted in the source domain and are viewed as new users in the target domain. Pre-training and then mapping is the common solution for the cross-domain cold-start recommendation. The former learns domain-specific user preference, and the latter transfers preference knowledge from the source to the target domain. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current mapping-based methods still have the following limitations. First, current mapping functions fail to fully consider the similarity of user behavioral patterns, either common transfer or personalized transfer mappings. Second, sparse supervision signals from the limited overlapping users, lead to insufficient mapping function learning for recommendation. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel MACDR model for cross-domain cold-start recommendation. Specifically, MACDR consists of two elaborate modules: a Prototype enhanced Mixture-Of-Experts (PMOE) based mapping function and a Preference Distribution Alignment (PDA) enhanced optimization. PMOE is designed to balance the transfer patterns of common and personalized preferences, following the basis that similar users share similar preference transfer. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, PDA is designed to explore the utilization of non-overlapping users in an unsupervised manner based on the prototype distribution alignment technique. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We have released the code to support the community at https://github.com/wzh-study/MACDR .",

        "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of smartphones, watches, and other devices, mobile crowd sensing has garnered significant public attention. Application service providers publish crowd sensing tasks, and users actively participate in collecting relevant sensing data, which are then submitted to servers. However, these data contain users' personal privacy. Therefore, this paper proposes a trajectory privacy protection method based on differential privacy(CTDP). First, the paper conducts clustering based on the features of user trajectory data to extract feature regions of the user trajectory. Then, a personalized privacy budget allocation method is developed based on the number of trajectory points in the feature region and the user's privacy requirements for sensitive trajectory points. A set of confusion points is generated within the feature range and a score is calculated based on its similarity to the trajectory points. Subsequently, the sampling probability is calculated based on the score and privacy budget of each confusion point, and finally the confusion points are selected through random sampling. The internationally recognized real dataset Cabspotting data was used for experimental evaluation. The experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper exhibits excellent performance in terms of data availability while providing sufficient privacy guarantees.",

        "abstract": "In edge computing environments, the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents significant challenges for data processing. These devices are often resource-constrained, eading to a trade-off between achieving efficiency and ensuring security. On one hand, traditional certificateless encryption methods are computationally expensive; on the other hand, offloading the computational load to third-party entities can enhance efficiency but still introduces security risks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight certificateless edge-assisted encryption scheme (CL-EAED). Ours scheme offloads computationally intensive tasks to edge servers, ensuring that edge-assisted processing does not expose sensitive information and only needs to be performed once. This approach effectively prevents data leakage and enhances both the efficiency and security of task offloading. Moreover, the CL-EAED scheme achieves IND-CCA security in standard model (SM) and has been validated using the ProVerif tool. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CL-EAED eliminates the dependency on computationally intensive pairing operations, significantly reducing computational and communication costs. It outperforms existing solutions in terms of energy consumption, latency, and scalability, fully meeting the requirements of practical applications.",

        "abstract": "In mobile crowdsensing applications, the single type data is inadequate to reflect the complexities of the real world and meet precise task requirements. Currently, there are few works that focus on mixed data in the context of mobile crowdsensing, and there is no work considering the credit issues of sensing platform. The privacy, fairness, and reliability of assessing the quality of mixed data remain unguaranteed. Therefore, we design a high-efficiency and privacy-preserving mixed data quality assessment scheme which adopts a dual-server architecture, designs secure k-prototype clustering for quality assessment, and conducts anomaly detection to eliminate anomalous data. Furthermore, we design a fair and reliable allocation mechanism to fairly allocate reward to users based on fixed and floating reward mechanisms for incentivizing rational users to submit high-quality mixed data. To prevent payment defaults by the sensing platform, we design verifiable credential to restrict them, ensuring payment fairness and transactional reliability. Finally, through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the proposed scheme. The results indicate that in terms of efficiency, the time overhead of mixed data quality assessment has been significantly reduced by three orders of magnitude compared to existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning can aggregate participant data features. To address the issue of insufficient overlapping data in vertical federated learning, this study presents a generative adversarial network model that allows distributed data augmentation. First, this study proposes a distributed generative adversarial network FeCGAN for multiple participants with insufficient overlapping data, considering the fact that the generative adversarial network can generate simulation samples. This network is suitable for multiple data sources and can augment participants' local data. Second, to address the problem of learning divergence caused by different local distributions of multiple data sources, this study proposes the aggregation algorithm FedKL. It aggregates the feedback of the local discriminator to interact with the generator and learns the local data distribution more accurately. Finally, given the problem of data waste caused by the unavailability of nonoverlapping data, this study proposes a data augmentation method called VFeDA. It uses FeCGAN to generate pseudo features and expands more overlapping data, thereby improving the data use. Experiments showed that the proposed model is suitable for multiple data sources and can generate high-quality data.",

        "abstract": "Prognostic assessment remains a critical challenge in medical research, often limited by the lack of well-labeled data. In this work, we introduce ContraSurv, a weakly-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, designed to enhance prognostic predictions in 3D medical images. ContraSurv utilizes both the self-supervised information inherent in unlabeled data and the weakly-supervised cues present in censored data, refining its capacity to extract prognostic representations. For this purpose, we establish a Vision Transformer architecture optimized for our medical image datasets and introduce novel methodologies for both self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning for prognostic assessment. Additionally, we propose a specialized supervised contrastive loss function and introduce SurvMix, a novel data augmentation technique for survival analysis. Evaluations were conducted across three cancer types and two imaging modalities on three real-world datasets. The results confirmed the enhanced performance of ContraSurv over competing methods, particularly in data with a high censoring rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a data augmentation method based on control theory and rule constraints, aiming to address the insufficient coverage issue in existing vehicle trajectory datasets. Grounded in control theory, the method combines the motion and safety rules of driving vehicles for data augmentation. It exhibits high interpretability, credibility, a minimal and controllable set of parameters, while maintaining physical feasibility. Additionally, a one-step Markov Decision Process is introduced to model the car following task as a short-term decision problem, adapting to unpredictable variations in the generated trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed rule-constrained data augmentation method significantly enhances the model's performance in addressing car following issues, showcasing strong adaptability and generalization capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Ensemble deep learning can combine strengths of neural network and ensemble learning and gradually becomes a new emerging research direction. However, the existing methods either lack theoretical support or demand large integrated models. To solve these problems, in this paper, Ensembles of Gradient Boosting Recurrent Neural Network (EGB-RNN) is proposed, which combines the gradient boosting ensemble framework with three types of recurrent neural network models, namely Minimal Gated Unit (MGU), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). RNN model is used as base learner to integrate an ensemble learner, through the way of gradient boosting. Meanwhile, for ensuring the ensemble model fit data better, Step Iteration Algorithm is designed to find an appropriate learning rate before models being integrated. Contrast trials are carried out on four time series data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that with the number of integration increasing, the performance of three types of EGB-RNN models tend to converge and the best EGB-RNN model and the best degree of ensemble vary with data sets. It is also shown in statistical results that the designed EGB-RNN models perform better than six baselines.",

        "abstract": "Multiple fault localization (MFL) identifies the positions of multiple faults (i.e., more than one fault) residing in a buggy program. It is notably more difficult as compared with single fault localization (SFL) which aims to locate a single fault (i.e., one fault) in a buggy program. Clustering-based multiple fault localization (CBMFL) is amongst the most popular MFL approaches, showing promising results in multiple fault localization. The requisite of launching CBMFL depends on test oracles to acquire the test results (i.e., a pass or a failure). In practice, test oracles are commonly not available known as the oracle problem, and CBMFL becomes infeasible in these cases. Inspired by metamorphic testing in solving the oracle problem, we attempt to combine this technique into CBMFL to broaden its application scope. Thus, we propose MetaMFL: Meta morphic M ultiple F ault L ocalization, which leverages metamorphic testing to extend CBMFL to the cases where test oracles are not available. Specifically, MetaMFL uses metamorphic testing groups as minimum units of testing. It defines metamorphic features for representing those that have violated metamorphic relations. Using these features, CBMFL can perform clustering to support parallel debugging, thus achieving MFL without test oracles. The large-scale experiments show that MetaMFL largely retains the effectiveness of CBMFL even though test oracles are not available.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT technology has heightened the requirement for effective data management and analysis. Knowledge graphs (KGs) and large pre-trained language models (LLMs) play crucial roles in this scenario: KGs offer structured data management, while LLMs enhance data feature analysis. However, as data privacy concerns escalate, IoT machine learning models become more susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To tackle this challenge, we focus MIAs in knowledge reasoning models (KRMs) for IoT environments and propose two attack methods: correlation attack (CA) and feature aggregation attack (FAA). CA leverages the relational features of KGs to link member characteristics across different parameter spaces. It aggregates these features and maps them into a non-linear space to identify linear relationships among members, thus improving membership recognition. In contrast, the FAA focuses on aggregating multiple member features, such as confidence scores, loss values, decision labels, and so on, within the KRM and projects them into a linear space. This method captures the interactions among different features, enhancing the differentiation between member and non-member samples. The key difference is that CA explores correlations between features across member identities, while FAA aggregates various features to improve overall representation and identification. Experimental results show that both CA and FAA outperform existing methods, offering a more effective assessment of privacy risks in KRMs within IoT environments.",

        "abstract": "The inherent characteristics involved in data can be mined from multi-scale information systems by extracting information from different value levels of features. Information fusion in constructing methods in the multi-scale information system may facilitate the performance of a learning model. In real applications, noise data and irrelevant or redundant features affect the generality of learning models. Therefore, keeping meaningful features and avoiding the effect of noise is essential for feature selection in a multi-scale information system. A bireduct is considered a sub-table where the attribute discerns all pairs of objects in the object set with different values of the decision attribute, and the attribute set and object set cannot be, respectively, reduced and extended without losing this property. In bireduct, multi-scale granulation can be used to characterize the importance and correlation of features at different scales. However, little work has taken the distribution of multi-scale data into account when granulating it. In addition, these approaches focus on solving the task of multi-scale data reduction only from the dimension perspective. To this end, a fuzzy-rough bireduct with supervised multi-scale granulation (FrBSmg) is proposed. First, the supervised multi-scale fuzzy granulation based on data distribution is constructed. Then, scaled uncertainty measures are defined to describe the fuzzy relevance of each feature. Furthermore, the global and local distributions of a sample are characterized simultaneously based on the positive region, which can reflect the degree of a sample belonging to some class, and the supervised fuzzy similarity relation can describe the degree of a sample belonging to its class. A strategy of Feature-Correlated Selection and Sample-Noisy Removal is devised for bireduct. Finally, the experimental results on twenty-one public datasets show the effectiveness of FrBSmg.",

        "abstract": "A vulnerability or error in a smart contract will lead to serious consequences including loss of assets and leakage of user privacy. Established smart contract vulnerability detection tools define vulnerabilities through symbolic execution, fuzz testing, and other methods requiring extremely specialized security knowledge. Even so, with the development of vulnerability exploitation techniques, vulnerability detection tools customized by experts cannot cope with the deformation of existing vulnerabilities or unknown vulnerabilities. The vulnerability detection based on machine learning developed in recent years studies vulnerabilities from different dimensions and designs corresponding models to achieve a high detection rate. However, these methods usually only focus on some features of smart contracts, or the model itself does not have universality. Experimental results on the publicly large-scale dataset SmartBugs-Wild demonstrate that this paper's method not only outperforms existing methods in several metrics, but also is scalable, general, and requires less domain knowledge, providing a new idea for the development of smart contract vulnerability detection.",

        "abstract": "Forests are the most extensive terrestrial ecosystems in the world. Their vertical structure information not only reflects the spatial structure characteristics of forest but also the physiological and ecological processes. The existing studies on forest vertical structure through remote sensing often encounter challenges such as high costs, difficulties in acquiring effective data, or complexities in data processing. In this study, a new technology for detecting vertical structure of vegetation is proposed and validated, which can obtain vertical structure of vegetation by single flight. In order to perform the new technology, a radar system is developed, incorporating a modular design scheme that emphasizes high integration and lightweight characteristics, which was deployed on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight platform. It consists of a main control unit, a signal processing unit, and a data recording unit, which weighs only 0.92 kg in total. Meanwhile, a novel algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the vertical structure of targets, effectively addressing critical challenges in UAV radar signal processing, such as strong system coupled signal, significant noise in radar signals, and high sidelobes in images. In order to validating the capability of the new technology, UAV flight experiments as well as in-situ observation were carried out in typical vegetation areas. The proposed algorithm was used to process the acquired radar echoes, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.33 m for the vegetation height compared to the ground synchronous measurement.",

        "abstract": "The bagging method has received much application and attention in recent years due to its good performance and simple framework. It has facilitated the advanced random forest method and accuracy-diversity ensemble theory. Bagging is an ensemble method based on simple random sampling (SRS) method with replacement. However, SRS is the most foundation sampling method in the field of statistics, where exists some other advanced sampling methods for probability density estimation. In imbalanced ensemble learning, down-sampling, over-sampling, and SMOTE methods have been proposed for generating base training set. However, these methods aim at changing the underlying distribution of data rather than simulating it better. The ranked set sampling (RSS) method uses auxiliary information to get more effective samples. The purpose of this article is to propose a bagging ensemble method based on RSS, which uses the ordering of objects related to the class to obtain more effective training sets. To explain its performance, we give a generalization bound of ensemble from the perspective of posterior probability estimation and Fisher information. On the basis of RSS sample having a higher Fisher information than SRS sample, the presented bound theoretically explains the better performance of RSS-Bagging. The experiments on 12 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RSS-Bagging statistically performs better than SRS-Bagging when the base classifiers are multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM).",

        "abstract": "Chart images, such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts, are explosively produced due to the wide usage of data visualizations. Accordingly, knowledge mining from chart images is becoming increasingly important, which can benefit downstream tasks like chart retrieval and knowledge graph completion. However, existing methods for chart knowledge mining mainly focus on converting chart images into raw data and often ignore their visual encodings and semantic meanings, which can result in information loss for many downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose ChartKG , a novel knowledge graph (KG) based representation for chart images, which can model the visual elements in a chart image and semantic relations among them including visual encodings and visual insights in a unified manner.Further, we develop a general framework to convert chart images to the proposed KG-based representation. It integrates a series of image processing techniques to identify visual elements and relations, e.g., CNNs to classify charts, yolov5 and optical character recognition to parse charts, and rule-based methods to construct graphs. We present four cases to illustrate how our knowledge-graph-based representation can model the detailed visual elements and semantic relations in charts, and further demonstrate how our approach can benefit downstream applications such as semantic-aware chart retrieval and chart question answering. We also conduct quantitative evaluations to assess the two fundamental building blocks of our chart-to-KG framework, i.e., object recognition and optical character recognition. The results provide support for the usefulness and effectiveness of ChartKG .",

        "abstract": "In the field of recommender systems, self-supervised learning has become an effective framework. In response to the noisy interaction behaviors in realworld scenarios, as well as the skewed distribution influenced by data sparsity and popularity bias, graph contrastive learning has been introduced as a powerful self-supervised method in collaborative filtering (CF) to learn enhanced user and item representations. Despite their success, neither heuristic manual enhancement methods nor the use of final node representations to construct contrastive pairs are sufficient to provide effective and rich self-supervised signals to regulate the training process. Therefore, the learned representations of users and items are either fragile or lack heuristic guidance. In light of this, we propose the Hierarchical multiview graph contrastive learning framework HMCF, which leverages the message passing mechanism at the layer level to introduce different granularity levels of view augmentation using supervised signals, thus better enhancing the CF paradigm. HMCF leverages rich, high-quality self-supervised signals from different granularity views for accurate contrastive optimization, helping to alleviate data sparsity and noise issues. It also explains the hierarchical topology and relative distances between nodes in the original graph. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets shows that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are widely used in the medical field, which makes it easier for doctors to gather patientsâ physiological information to diagnose their physical status. Recently, a variety of lightweight authentication key agreement (AKA) protocols have been proposed for WBANs. However, the computational overhead of the authentication process for most of these protocols increases exponentially when the number of patients increases dramatically. Therefore, to improve the authentication efficiency, a many-to-one, lightweight batch AKA protocol based on the Chinese remainder theorem is proposed, which can realize that Cloud Server (CS) interacts with the gateway nodes once to obtain multiple session keys with different sensor nodes, so as to achieve the effect that multiple sensor nodes participate in the AKA at the same time. In addition, only hash function, XOR operation, and symmetric encryption are used in the proposed protocol. During the key agreement process, CS can compute the session key between it and the sensor node on demand. Sensor nodes can dynamically join and leave the WBAN, which increases the flexibility of the protocol. We verify the protocolâs security using formal security analysis tools, such as the real-or-random model, Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, and the ProVerif tool. The experiment and comparison results indicate that the proposed protocol outperforms the other related protocols in terms of efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks(GNNs), such as Graph Convolutional Network, have exhibited impressive performance on various real-world datasets. However, many researches have confirmed that deliberately designed adversarial attacks can easily confuse GNNs on the classification of target nodes (targeted attacks) or all the nodes (global attacks). According to our observations, different attributes tend to be differently treated when the graph is attacked. Unfortunately, most of the existing defense methods can only defend at the graph or node level, which ignores the diversity of different attributes within each node. To address this limitation, we propose to leverage a new property, named Attribute-level Smoothness (ALS), which is defined based on the local differences of graph. We then propose a novel defense method, named GCN with Attribute-level Defense (ALD-GCN), which utilizes the ALS property to provide attribute-level protection to each attributes. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed work and the potentials of our ALS property in the attacks.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are driving green and low-carbon transport in modern cities. It makes charging station occupancy prediction (CSOP) critual for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to achieve a balance between the supply and demand in resolving the dynamics between EVs and changing stations. Even though several big data-based solutions have been discussed, they are still struggling to collaboratively utilize heterogeneous data and distributed computing resources located at both physically and logicially isolated charging stations to better support context-driven CSOP. To addres this challenge, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Meta-learning Mechanism (AFML) for CSOP, which can train a meta-model with strong adaptation ability in an asynchronous and collaborative manner. In general, it incorporates an adaptive reptile algorithm (AR) and an weighted aggregation strategy (WA) to jointly ensure the training efficiency and model adaptivity. Evaluations on real-world CSOP datasets demonstrate that compared to the second best method, AFML can significantly improve forecasting accuracy by 14%, accelerate model convergence by 9% and enhance model generalizability by 10%, illustrating its merits in support CSOP to embrace a smart and sustainable city.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) reliability evaluation contributes to the sustainable computing and enhanced stability of the network. Previous algorithms usually evaluate the reliability of IoT by enumenating the states of nodes and networks, which are difficult to handle IoT with hundreds of nodes because the computational cost. In this paper, a novel algorithm, TMCRA, is proposed to evaluate the reliability of IoT in complex network environment, which consider both coverage and connectivity. For coverage, TMCRA employs the Confident Information Coverage (CIC) model to divide the target area into independent grids and calculates the coverage rate. In terms of connectivity, TMCRA forming the Virtual Backbone Network (VBN) based on two proposed methods: TMA and MGIN, and evaluate connectivity by analyzing the VBN rather than the whole network. The TMA and MGIN are two algorithms for constructing Minimum Connected Dominant Sets (MCDS), which are suitable for different scale networks. Finally, based on the data of coverage and connectivity, TMCRA utilizes tensors for the unified modeling and representation of network structure, and calculates IoT reliability based on the tensors. Simulations are carried out for various sizes of IoT to show the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach in reliability evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Speaker extraction and diarization are two enabling techniques for real-world speech applications. Speaker extraction aims to extract a target speaker's voice from a speech mixture, while speaker diarization demarcates speech segments by speaker, annotating âwho spoke whenâ. Previous studies have typically treated the two tasks independently. In practical applications, it is more meaningful to have knowledge about âwho spoke what and whenâ, which is captured by the two tasks. The two tasks share a similar objective of disentangling speakers. Speaker extraction operates in the frequency domain, whereas diarization is in the temporal domain. It is logical to believe that speaker activities obtained from speaker diarization can benefit speaker extraction, while the extracted speech offers more accurate speaker activity detection than the speech mixture. In this paper, we propose a unified model called Universal Speaker Extraction and Diarization (USED) to address output inconsistency and scenario mismatch issues. It is designed to manage speech mixtures with varying overlap ratios and variable number of speakers. We show that the USED model significantly outperforms the competitive baselines for speaker extraction and diarization tasks on LibriMix and SparseLibriMix datasets. We further validate the diarization performance on CALLHOME, a dataset based on real recordings, and experimental results indicate that our model surpasses recently proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "With the increase in data volume, more types of data are being used and shared, especially in the power Internet of Things (IoT). However, the processes of data sharing may lead to unexpected information leakage because of the ubiquitous relevance among the different data, thus it is necessary for data owners to conduct preventive audits for data applications before data sharing to avoid the risk of key information leakage. Considering that the same data may play completely different roles in different application scenarios, data owners should know the expected data applications of the data buyers in advance and provide modified data that are less relevant to the private information of the data owners and more relevant to the nonprivate information that the data buyers need. In this paper, data sharing in the power IoT is regarded as the background, and the mutual information of the data and their implicit information is selected as the data feature parameter to indicate the relevance between the data and their implicit information or the ability to infer the implicit information from the data. Therefore, preventive audits should be conducted based on changes in the data feature parameters before and after data sharing. The probability exchange adjustment method is pro-posed as the theoretical basis of preventive audits under simplified consumption, and the corresponding optimization models are constructed and extended to more practical scenarios with multivari-ate characteristics. Finally, case studies are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed preventive audits.",

        "abstract": "Reducing the radiation dose in CT scanning is important to alleviate the damage to the human health in clinical scenes. A promising way is to replace the normal-dose CT (NDCT) imaging by low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging with lower tube voltage and tube current. This often brings severe noise to the LDCT images, which adversely affects the diagnosis accuracy. Most of existing LDCT image denoising networks are trained either with synthetic LDCT images or real-world LDCT and NDCT image pairs with huge spatial misalignment. However, the synthetic noise is very different from the complex noise in real-world LDCT images, while the huge spatial misalignment brings inaccurate predictions of tissue structures in the denoised LDCT images. To well utilize real-world LDCT and NDCT image pairs for LDCT image denoising, in this paper, we introduce a new Patch Similarity Purification (PSP) strategy to construct high-quality training dataset for network training. Specifically, our PSP strategy first perform binarization for each pair of image patches cropped from the corresponding LDCT and NDCT image pairs. For each pair of binary masks, it then computes their similarity ratio by common mask calculation, and the patch pair can be selected as a training sample if their mask similarity ratio is higher than a threshold. By using our PSP strategy, each training set of our Rabbit and Patient datasets contain hundreds of thousands of real-world LDCT and NDCT image patch pairs with negligible misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our PSP strategy on purifying the training data and the effectiveness of training LDCT image denoising networks on our datasets.

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a competitive method in single-modality-dominated remote sensing (RS) data classification tasks, but its classification performance inevitably encounters a bottleneck due to the lack of representation diversity in complicated spatial structures with various land cover types. Therefore, the RS community has been actively researching multimodal feature learning techniques for the same scene. However, expert annotation of multisource data consumes a significant amount of time and cost. This article proposes an end-to-end method called semisupervised multimodal dual-path network (SMDN). This method simultaneously explore spatial-spectral features contained in hyperspectral images (HSI) and elevation information provided by light detection and ranging (LiDAR). SMDN exploits an unsupervised novel encoder-decoder structure as the backbone network to construct a multimodal DL architecture by jointly training with a data-specific branch. To obtain discriminative multimodal representations, SMDN is able to guide the collaborative training of two different unsupervised features mapped in the latent subspace with limited labeled training samples. Furthermore, after a simple modification of the fusion strategy in SMDN, it can be applied to unsupervised classification problems. Experimental results on benchmark RS datasets validate the effectiveness of the developed SMDN compared over many state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The privacy-preserving query is critical for modern blockchain systems, especially when supporting many crucial applications such as finance and healthcare. Recent advances in blockchain query schemes mainly focus on enhancing the traceability efficiency of integrity authentication. Despite these efforts, we argue that the exposure of retrieval information may result in privacy leakage, which inevitably poses an important yet unresolved challenge. In this paper, we introduce Cloak, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain query scheme with two notable features. First, it utilizes a two-phase distributed query requests technique, i.e., division and aggregation, to hide retrieval information based on the natural independent characteristic of blockchain. Second, we add noise to the sub-request set to avoid malicious attacks during transmission and adopt smart contract-based asymmetric encryption to guarantee the correctness of query results. Experimental results demonstrate that Cloak improves the query performance by up to 4Ã and reduces the storage overhead by 50% compared with the state-of-the-art Spiral.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, particularly with methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. However, these methods have several limitations. 1) The limited receptive field inherent in the convolutional layer greatly hampers capturing feature contextual information on a large scale. 2) Transformers cannot establish strong local relationships, making it challenging to characterize complex dependencies between distant pixels and different bands in HSIs. Moreover, as the network complexity increases, so does the number of network parameters. We propose a novel network called the spectral-spatial convolutional fusion long-range dependency transformer network (LRDTN) for HSI classification to address these challenges. LRDTN comprises three key components: the dynamic dependency convolution module ( DDC ), the multiscale enhancement fusion module ( MsEF ), and the local-global perception transducer ( LGPT ). Specifically, the DDC dynamically models local features, while the MsEF integrates information from different scales to capture contextual relationships in HSI features effectively. Additionally, the ability to mine and utilize HSI local-global features and complex long-range dependencies is enhanced by the proposed transformer variant, LGPT . Ultimately, through the ingeniously designed structure of the LRDTN, the model effectively maintains its performance while reducing the number of network parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on four typical HSI datasets, including urban areas, agricultural areas, and swamps, demonstrate the superiority of LRDTN over other state-of-the-art networks.

        "abstract": "Recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attracted attention in the research of hyperspectral image (HSI) unmixing, but still calling for complementary approaches to process global information. Consequently, a few Transformer-based unmixing networks have been developed. To enhance the richness and diversity of features, a network called SSLT-Net is proposed, which it is the combination of CNN and linear transformer. This network capably extracts local, global, spatial, and spectral features of the HSI, enabling it to accomplish an optimized fusion of these four diverse characteristics. It comprises three pivotal modules: a Grouped Multi-Scale Convolution Module encodes low level features from different receptive fields. Then, a LSTransformer module is proposed, which is a linear transformer with a shuffle attention (SA) block used to extract global spatial and spectral features of images. Finally, a MaxPoolformer module is designed to utilize max pooling to strengthen local features. The above two modules are connected in parallel to form a dual branch structure to encode deeper composite features. By comparing with six methods on three real datasets (Apex, Samson, Jasper Ridge), the proposed network has showcased its formidable potential and distinct advantages in tackling hyperspectral unmixing tasks. The experimental results indicate that it is crucial to extract and fuse various features (local and global, spectral and spatial) in hyperspectral unmixing tasks.

        "abstract": "The semantic segmentation of indoor scenes based on RGB and Depth information has been a persistent and enduring research topic. However, how to fully utilize the complementarity of multimodal features and achieve efficient fusion remains a challenging research topic. To address this challenge, we proposed an innovative cross-modal comprehensive feature aggregation network (CCANet) to achieve high-precision semantic segmentation of indoor scenes. In this method, we first propose a bidirectional cross-modality feature rectification module (BCFR) to complement each other and remove noise in both channel and spatial correlations. After that, the adaptive criss-cross attention fusion module (CAF) is designed to realize multi-stage deep multi-modal feature fusion. Finally, a multi-supervision strategy is applied to accurately learn additional details of the target, guiding the gradual refinement of segmentation maps. By conducting thorough experiments on two openly accessible datasets of indoor scenes, the results demonstrate that CCANet exhibits outstanding performance and robustness in aggregating RGB and depth features.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, vision-based computing tasks play an important role in various real-world applications. However, many vision computing tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, are usually computationally expensive, posing a challenge to the computing systems that are resource-constrained but require fast response speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this end, we propose the spatial-detail guided context propagation network (SGCPNet) for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency. On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SGCPNet model. On the Cityscapes dataset, for example, our SGCPNet achieves 69.5% mIoU segmentation accuracy, while its speed reaches 178.5 FPS on 768 x 1536 images on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU card. In addition, SGCPNet is very lightweight and only contains 0.61 M parameters. The code will be released at https://github.com/zhouyuan888888/SGCPNet.",

        "abstract": "Due to its open-source nature, Android operating system has been the main target of attackers to exploit. Malware creators always perform different code obfuscations on their apps to hide malicious activities. Features extracted from these obfuscated samples through program analysis contain many useless and disguised features, which leads to many false negatives. To address the issue, in this paper, we demonstrate that obfuscation-resilient malware family analysis can be achieved through contrastive learning. The key insight behind our analysis is that contrastive learning can be used to reduce the difference introduced by obfuscation while amplifying the difference between malware and other types of malware. Based on the proposed analysis, we design a system that can achieve robust and interpretable classification of Android malware. To achieve robust classification, we perform contrastive learning on malware samples to learn an encoder that can automatically extract robust features from malware samples. To achieve interpretable classification, we transform the function call graph of a sample into an image by centrality analysis. Then the corresponding heatmaps can be obtained by visualization techniques. These heatmaps can help users understand why the malware is classified as this family. We implement IFDroid and perform extensive evaluations on two datasets. Experimental results show that IFDroid is superior to state-of-the-art Android malware familial classification systems. Moreover, IFDroid is capable of maintaining a 98.4% F1 on classifying 69,421 obfuscated malware samples.",

In practice, slice-level vulnerability detection is fine-grained but may contain incomplete vulnerability details. Function-level vulnerability detection includes full vulnerability semantics but may contain vulnerability-unrelated statements. Meanwhile, they pay more attention to predicting whether the source code is vulnerable and cannot pinpoint which statements are more likely to be vulnerable. In this paper, we design mVulPreter , a multi-granularity vulnerability detector that can provide interpretations of detection results. Specifically, we propose a novel technique to effectively blend the advantages of function-level and slice-level vulnerability detection models and output the detection results' interpretation only by the model itself. We evaluate mVulPreter on a dataset containing 5,310 vulnerable functions and 7,601 non-vulnerable functions. The experimental results indicate that mVulPreter outperforms existing state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches ( i.e ., Checkmarx , FlawFinder , RATS , TokenCNN , StatementLSTM , SySeVR , and Devign ).",

        "abstract": "Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols are gaining attention for their resilience against network attacks. Among them, Multi-valued Byzantine Agreement (MVBA) protocols play a critical role, which accepts input values from each replica and returns a consistent output. The state-of-the- art MVBA protocol, sMVBA, has a good-case latency of 6Î´ and an expected bad-case latency of 12Î´, with Î´ representing the network delay. Additionally, sMVBA exhibits a communication of O ( n 2 ) in both good and bad cases. Although it outperforms other MVBA protocols, sMVBA still lags behind partially-synchronous counterparts. For instance, PBFT achieves a good-case latency of 3Î´, and HotStuff boasts a good-case communication of O( n ). This paper introduces a novel MVBA protocol, Pako, aiming for performance comparable to partially-synchronous protocols. Pako leverages an existing MVBA protocol as a black box and introduces an additional view with an optimistic path to commit values efficiently. Two Pako variants, Pako1 and Pako2, provide a trade-off between latency and communication. To be more specific, Pako1 achieves a good-case latency of 3Î´ with O ( n 2 ) communication, while Pako2 reduces the communication to O ( n ) with a slightly higher good-case latency of 5Î´. A series of experiments demonstrate Pakoâs significant outperformance of counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a human brain-inspired computing paradigm that processes neural activity patterns with high dimensional vectors. Existing HDC accelerators usually utilize different hardware architectures to process encoding phases and comparison phases of HDC applications separately. They are unable to adapt to dynamic workloads for various datasets, resulting in resource underutilization. In this paper, we propose a ReRAM-based HDC accelerator called ReHDC for general HDC. We abstract the computing paradigms in encoding and comparison phases, and provide uniform primitive operators to efficiently process these two phases with the same hardware architecture. In the unified processing engine, ReHDC utilizes analog crossbar arrays to accelerate accumulation operations, and digital crossbar arrays to speed up high-dimensional element-wise operations (XOR). Experimental results show that ReHDC can accelerate the HDC training by 69.4Ã and 1.93Ã, and can also improve the energy efficiency by 51.5Ã and 2.2Ã, compared with NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU and the ReRAM-based HDC accelerator DUAL, respectively. Moreover, the performance speedup and energy efficiency for HDC inference are similar to that of HDC training.",

        "abstract": "Optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs) have emerged as the most promising solution for on-chip interconnection networks, offering distinct advantages such as high bandwidth and low latency. However, traditional wired-based ONoCs often suffer from a high average number of hops, leading to challenges such as increased insertion loss, crosstalk noise, and energy consumption. Therefore, this paper presents a novel ONoC structure known as the metasurface ONoC (MSONoC), which integrates wired waveguide and free-space optical (FSO) transmission with the assistance of metasurfaces. Specifically, this work encompasses the design of a passive metasurface structure tailored for ONoCs, a virtual network cluster partitioning method, an optical metasurface access points select strategy, and a shortest-path routing algorithm. Performance verification is conducted using a modified Noxim simulator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MSONoC offers advantages over traditional NoCs, radio frequency (RF)-based hybrid wired/wireless NoCs, and wired-based ONoCs in terms of throughput, delay, energy consumption, and signal-to-noise ratio under both synthetic traffic and real traffic models. These improvements proves the effectiveness of the MSONoC architecture in optimizing network performance, making it a promising solution for high-performance, energy-efficient communication in on-chip networks.",

        "abstract": "Data clustering is a pivotal aspect of data mining, attracting significant attention in the exploration of cluster analysis through optimization algorithms. However, challenges arise in the application of optimization-based techniques, stemming from the non-linear nature of the objective function and the complexities inherent in the search space. Clustering, serving as an unsupervised data analysis technique, is employed to discern homogeneous groups of objects by evaluating the values of their attributes. To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, we have proposed in this article a new metaheuristic based on a mathematical model called Sinh Cosh Optimizer (SCHO). This optimizer is based on the geometric functions Sinh and Cosh and consists of four key stages: the exploitation and exploration phases, the limited search strategy and the implementation of a switching mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested approach, we conduct a comparative analysis against four widely acknowledged metaheuristic methods found in the literature. The assessment is performed using ten standard datasets sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These artificial intelligence algorithms are renowned for their promising capabilities in addressing machine learning problems, particularly those related to data clustering. Thorough computational experiments and the analysis of outcomes reveal that the algorithm introduced in this study not only surpasses the performance of the comparison algorithms employed but also demonstrates notable stability. Furthermore, its efficacy extends beyond the experimented scenarios, making it a viable solution for addressing other high-dimensional clustering problems.",

        "abstract": "In a big data environment, the data from long-term monitoring are of great importance in intelligent diagnoses, prognostic and health management of industrial components. However, in practice, it is difficult to ensure high reconstructive accuracy making the preservation performance of low-frequency information (e.g., periodic fault impulses) stable. To address this issue, this article proposes a new data reconstruction method that combines a smoothing sparse low-rank matrix (SSLRM) with online dictionary learning. This article first presents the design of SSLRM model for decomposing the raw data into a low resonance component (LRC) and a high resonance component (HRC), such that the periodic fault impulse can be isolated and preserved in advance. Then, both LRC and HRC are, respectively, reconstructed using an online dictionary learning algorithm, i.e., Hankel K-singular value decomposition; thus, the reconstructed data can be obtained accordingly. Both simulation case and engineering case are applied to show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "As a big data analysis technique, hierarchical clustering is helpful in summarizing data since it returns the clusters of the data and their clustering history. Cloud computing is the most suitable option to efficiently perform hierarchical clustering over numerous data. However, since compromised cloud service providers can cause serious privacy problems by revealing data, it is necessary to solve the problems prior to using the external cloud service. Privacy-preserving hierarchical clustering protocol in an outsourced computing environment has never been proposed in existing works. Existing protocols have several problems that limit the number of participating data owners or disclose the information of data. In this paper, we propose a parallelly running and privacy-preserving agglomerative hierarchical clustering (ppAHC) over the union of datasets of multiple parties in an outsourced computing environment, which is the first protocol to the best of our knowledge. The proposed ppAHC does not disclose any information about input and output, including the data access patterns. The proposed ppAHC is highly efficient and suitable for big data analysis to handle numerous data since its cost for one round is independent of the amount of data. It allows data owners without sufficient computing capability to participate in a collaborative hierarchical clustering.",

        "abstract": "The accurate prediction of industry trends has become increasingly challenging because of unforeseen events. To address this challenge, this study proposes a deep learning approach to generate an economic sentiment index by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and image-clustering techniques. We first employ sampling techniques to create standardized online news datasets. Feature engineering techniques from the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KoBERT) model are then used to generate relevance and sentiment scores for the textual data. Further, to enhance visualization and clustering, we transform the textual data into joint plot images, which are grouped into distinct clusters based on news categories. Finally, using Multi-criteria Decision Analysis, the various scores and cluster information are synthesized to generate the final economic sentiment index. This approach improves visualization and enhances the interpretability of the generated index. The proposed algorithm is applied to construct a new economic sentiment index for the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry in South Korea.",

        "abstract": "The history of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed the significant impact of high-quality data on various deep learning models, such as ImageNet for AlexNet and ResNet. Recently, instead of designing more complex neural architectures as model-centric approaches, the attention of AI community has shifted to data-centric ones, which focuses on better processing data to strengthen the ability of neural models. Graph learning, which operates on ubiquitous topological data, also plays an important role in the era of deep learning. In this survey, we comprehensively review graph learning approaches from the data-centric perspective, and aim to answer three crucial questions: (1) when to modify graph data , (2) what part of the graph data needs modification to unlock the potential of various graph models, and (3) how to safeguard graph models from problematic data influence. Accordingly, we propose a novel taxonomy based on the stages in the graph learning pipeline, and highlight the processing methods for different data structures in the graph data, i.e., topology, feature and label. Furthermore, we analyze some potential problems embedded in graph data and discuss how to solve them in a data-centric manner. Finally, we provide some promising future directions for data-centric graph learning.",

In consumer applications, multimodal data is experiencing explosive growth. Therefore, multimodal FL has emerged as a crucial research area. However, applying traditional FL methods directly to multimodal data poses certain challenges. Additionally, issues like sensor failures result in modality-imbalanced data among clients, i.e., the number and type of data modalities between client devices vary. Hence, it is imperative to design specialized FL frameworks and models specifically tailored for analyzing multimodal data. To address these challenges, we propose a tensor fusion-based multimodal federated learning (TenMFL). First, a tensor dynamic fusion network is designed for addressing the challenge of multimodal data fusion. This approach separates the parameter forward computation and the modal fusion computation, effectively resolving issues related to client-side modality imbalance. Second, we introduce a hybrid fusion method that combines feature fusion and decision fusion to further exploit the complementarity of multimodal data. We evaluate TenMFL on three multimodal datasets, experimental results demonstrate our superior performances.",

        "abstract": "Industrial intelligent systems (IIS) play a huge role in modern industry, and their intelligent models of IIS enable diagnosis of faults, key performance indicator (KPI) prediction, and other important industrial process analysis in a data-driven way. However, the performance of intelligent models is limited by the quantity and quality of local data in specific factories. At the same time, the privacy information and security concerns contained by industrial data lead to the problem of information silos in industry. This hinders data sharing and cross-factory collaborations. To address these issues, this article makes the following contributions. First, for the first time, we empower industrial federated big data analytics (IFBDA) of IIS with swarm learning, and propose a hyperledger fabric-based IFBDA blockchain (IFBDAchain) for multifactory information sharing and collaborative modeling. Second, in the IFBDAchain, we further consider potential dishonest behaviors among federated members, and design verification and privacy protection mechanisms to ensure trustworthiness of analytics. Third, we validate the IFBDAchain with two real industrial cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the IFBDAchain in fault classification and KPI prediction tasks in industry. Compared to the average values of local learning, our method increases the classification accuracy by 27.6%, 69.4%, and 33.1% under Independent and identically distributed (IID), non-IID, and unbalanced conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error of the KPI prediction decreases by 33.3%, 49%, and 45.7% for the IID, non-IID, and unbalanced conditions, respectively, indicating its significant potential as a generic backbone for industrial federated Big Data analytics.",

        "abstract": "Due its superiority in addressing label ambiguity, Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has received wide attention from the community, such as image classification, emotion recognition, and big data processing. To efficiently process the data with label distribution, researchers have proposed to learn label-specific features (LSFs) that are the discriminative features for each class label. Although the LDL literature has seen many algorithms to learn LSFs, most of them ignore the characteristics of label distribution. Label distribution lies in real-value vector space with specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose to learn label-distribution-specific features (LDSFs) for processing label-distribution data by considering the structures of label distribution. We design a novel LDL method called LDL-LDSF to exploit LDSFs by considering the fuzzy cluster structures of label distribution data. First, LDL-LDSF learns the LDSFs for the whole label distribution by jointly learning the label distribution and fuzzy c-means clustering. Second, it learns the LDSFs for each label in a similar way. Third, it concatenates the learned LDSFs with the original features to deduce an LDL model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to justify that LDL-LDSF statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art LDL methods and validate the advantages of LDSFs for processing label-distribution data.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot anomalous node detection in dynamic networks has been extensively investigated in the field of research. In this few-shot scenario, the detection of these anomalous nodes is particularly challenging due to the continuously evolving network topology and data distribution over time, which is known as concept drift. Concept drift refers to the phenomenon where the underlying concepts or patterns in the data generation process change over time, leading to varying data distributions across different periods. Due to these changes in data distribution, the patterns learned during training may become invalid under the new data distribution. Existing models primarily aim to enhance the representation of evolving node attributes and relationships to mitigate the impact of concept drift in few-shot scenarios. However, the scarcity of anomalous samples further limits the modelâs ability to learn new patterns, thereby reducing its effectiveness in addressing concept drift in few-shot scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose the multitask asynchronous metalearning framework (MAMF), which aims to mitigate bias induced by concept drift in few-shot anomalous node detection. Our framework consists of four main components: a feature extractor, an anomaly simulator, an asynchronous learner, and a type detector. The feature extractor captures the relative variations of each node in an evolving graph stream. The anomaly simulator uses generative adversarial models to learn anomaly distributions and generate samples at different time intervals. The asynchronous learner samples from various time distributions to create metatasks for anomalous node detection, allowing it to adapt to changes between these distributions. To aid in few-shot anomalous node detection, the type detector is used for anomaly type recognition. Our framework achieves AUC improvements of 5.12%, 6.87%, and 1.91% over the best existing methods on Wikipedia, Reddit, and Mooc datasets, respectively, demon...",

        "abstract": "Designing a robust air transportation network is critical for aviation activities to maintain highly efficient operations. Given certain total route cost, designing a strategy to improve the robustness of the network is a challenging issue. In this paper, first, a comparison experiment based on a small example shows the total effective resistance is a superior measure satisfying two critical criteria that other measures do not satisfy. Consequently, we explicitly formulate the network optimization problem as the minimization of total effective resistance under several constraints. The problem is often too time-consuming to solve to the optimal by exact methods. To achieve better efficiency, we propose a convex relaxation method for medium-scale networks making use of the problem properties. For large-scale networks, a clustering based convex relaxation method, reducing the dimensions of the network via selecting critical airports, is further proposed. To demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed methods, simulations are performed on nine typical scale-free network and two real air transportation networks including Jetstar Asia Airway and domestic American Airlines. Note to Practitioners âThe crucial need for designing robust air transportation networks in the aviation industry serves as the impetus for this work. The application scenarios range from the design of airport and flight operation networks for airlines, to air traffic networks with airways and waypoints, extending to drone cargo networks. An essential characteristic of a well-designed network is its ability to preserve connectivity, as much as possible, when it experiences disruptions such as flight cancellation or airway navigation equipment failure. The paper presents an argument for using total effective resistance as the key measure of network robustness, showing it to outperform other measures. Weâve developed specialized algorithms that leverage the unique properties of this optimizat...",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer's disease detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of Big Data in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a more precise classification of Alzheimer's disease progression levels. The effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle Alzheimer dataset, and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications in early Alzheimer's disease detection.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot image generation aims to train generative models using a small number of training images. When there are few images available for training (e.g. 10 images), Learning From Scratch (LFS) methods often generate images that closely resemble the training data while Transfer Learning (TL) methods try to improve performance by leveraging prior knowledge from GANs pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, current TL methods may not allow for sufficient control over the degree of knowledge preservation from the source model, making them unsuitable for setups where the source and target domains are not closely related. To address this, we propose a novel pipeline called Peer is your Pillar (PIP), which combines a target few-shot dataset with a peer dataset to create a data-unbalanced conditional generation. Our approach includes a class embedding method that separates the class space from the latent space, and we use a direction loss based on pre-trained CLIP to improve image diversity. Experiments on various few-shot datasets demonstrate the advancement of the proposed PIP, especially reduces the training requirements of few-shot image generation.",

However, existing datasets often lack the complexity needed to represent real-world outdoor environments, resulting in limited performance of object detection algorithms at extended distances.Synthetic data generation offers a way to address these limitations by creating varied and realistic training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach utilizing BlenderProc procedural generation and photorealistic rendering to create a synthetic dataset that captures diverse and realistic outdoor scenes for the objects detection. We trained YOLO model on this dataset and compared its performance with standard YOLO model. Our approach achieved a precision of 94% and recall of 96% for detecting objects at distances exceeding 120 meters, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. These findings underscore the potential of advanced synthetic data generation techniques to enhance long-range object detection and address critical challenges in surveillance, remote sensing, and autonomous systems.",

        "abstract": "Contrastive quantization (applying vector quantization to contrastive learning) has achieved great success in large-scale image retrieval because of its advantage of high computational efficiency and small storage space. This article designs a novel optimization framework to simultaneously optimize the cross quantization and the debiased contrastive learning, termed Debiased Cross Contrastive Quantization (DCCQ). The proposed framework is implemented in an end-to-end network, resulting in both reduced quantization error and deletion of many false negative samples. Specifically, to increase the distinguishability between codewords, DCCQ introduces the codeword similarity loss and soft quantization entropy loss for network training. Furthermore, the memory bank strategy and multi-crop image augmentation strategy are employed to promote the effectiveness and efficiency of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real image benchmark datasets show that the proposed DCCQ yields state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "The performance of graph collaborative filtering (GCF) models could be affected by noisy user-item interactions. Existing studies on data denoising either ignore the nature of noise in implicit feedback or seldom consider the long-tail distribution of historical interaction data. For the first challenge, we analyze the role of noise from a causal perspective: noise is an unobservable confounder. Therefore, we use the instrumental variable for causal intervention without requiring confounder observation. For the second challenge, we consider degree distribution of nodes in the course of causal intervention. And then we propose a model named causal graph collaborative filtering (CausalGCF) to denoise implicit feedback for GCF. Specifically, we design a degree augmentation strategy as the instrumental variable. First, we divide nodes into head and tail nodes according to their degree. Then, we purify the interactions of the head nodes and enrich those of the tail nodes based on similarity. We perform degree augmentation strategy from the user and item sides to obtain two different graph structures, which are trained together with self-supervised learning. Empirical studies on four real and four synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CausalGCF, which is more robust against noisy interactions in implicit feedback than the baselines.",

        "abstract": "Emergency-related knowledge from urban rail transit (URT) safety event case base is crucial for realizing intelligent emergency response in URT. However, safety event case records are non-standard and unstructured, leading to challenges in data mining, information induction, and knowledge organization. To obtain emergency-related knowledge effectively from URT safety event cases, this paper proposes a knowledge acquisition model incorporating label semantics and provides a knowledge acquisition degree evaluation method. In this study, the knowledge acquisition task is formulated as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. This formulation can take full advantage of the rich semantic information of labels, which can compensate for the drawbacks of the traditional sequence labeling model. The experiments conducted on the URT safety event case base demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The knowledge acquisition model performs well on different labels and achieves a performance boost over baseline models. Note to Practitioners âUrban rail transit (URT) safety events are caused by various factors, such as natural disasters like earthquakes and floods, equipment failures, and terrorist attacks. et al. These events may disrupt the normal operation of URT, pose a great risk to personal safety, and result in property losses. URT safety event cases encompass essential emergency-related experience and knowledge, which serve as valuable references for managing new emergencies and mitigating potential losses. However, the record format of URT safety event cases is non-standard, with the majority stored as fragmented textual data, posing challenges in effectively extracting and utilizing the valuable knowledge they contain. Considering the data characteristics of URT safety event cases, three different methods are developed for knowledge acquisition. Among these methods, a knowledge acquisition model is proposed to extract emergency-related knowledge from URT...",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision and finds extensive applications in scene understanding, medical image analysis, and remote sensing. With the advent of deep learning, significant advancements have been made in segmentation tasks. However, deep learning models require a substantial amount of labeled data for training, and accurately annotating datasets is labor-intensive and costly. Recently, numerous studies have explored the semantic segmentation task through the lens of semi-supervised learning, with the pseudo-labeling (PL) method emerging as a straightforward and widely applicable approach. This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of various PL methods and their applications in semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) from multiple angles. Initially, it captures the essence of individual model self-training and the collaborative training of multiple models from a model-centric viewpoint. Next, it explores strategies for refining or dismissing unreliable methods. Then, it categorizes techniques for addressing noisy PL data and inspects improvements in PL methods from the perspective of data augmentation. It further provides insights into optimization strategies. Furthermore, it examines PL methods from an application-oriented standpoint, such as in medical image segmentation and remote sensing image segmentation. Lastly, this paper evaluates the performance of cutting-edge methods on public datasets and concludes by discussing the challenges and potential directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Metaverse allows users to immersively interact with millions of partners, breaking through the constraints of the physical world. To ensure the traceability of malicious avatars, provers in large-scale commercial activities need to periodically submit identity parameters to the verifier as interaction evidence, imposing a disastrous communication and storage burden on both parties. In this paper, we propose a traceable and efficient continuous authentication scheme for large-scale avatars. First, we construct a continuous authentication framework, where the proverâs device locally checks its manipulator to submit the starting and ending identities as interaction evidence. Second, we propose a transitive signature scheme with path verifiability to ensure the relevance and unforgeability of the starting and ending identities. Finally, we design a traceable authentication protocol based on the proposed signature scheme to reduce communication and storage costs while guaranteeing traceability. Security analysis shows that the protocol not only defends against the attacks of device hijacking and false accusations but also supports virtual-to-physical tracking. Extensive evaluations show that the communication cost and storage costs are reduced by 95.97% and 98.35%, respectively, which can be used for avatar authentication and tracking in large-scale commercial activities.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL , which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners ( i.e. , the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.",

        "abstract": "Sleep staging is imperative for evaluating sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Extant sleep staging methods with fusing multiple data-views of physiological signals have achieved promising results. However, they remain neglectful of the relationship among different data-views at different feature scales with view position-alignment. To address this, we propose a novel cross-view alignment network, termed cVAN, utilising scale-aware attention for sleep stages classification. Specifically, cVAN principally incorporates two sub-networks of a residual- like network which learn spectral information from time-frequency images and a transformer- like network which learns corresponding temporal information. The prime advantage of cVAN is to adaptively align the learned feature scales among the different data-views of physiological signals with a scale-aware attention by reorganizing feature maps. Extensive experiments on three public sleep datasets demonstrate that cVAN can achieve a new state-of-the-art result, which is superior to existing counterparts. The source code for cVAN is accessible at the URL ( https://github.com/Fibonaccirabbit/cVAN ).",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) advancements have greatly enhanced anomaly detection of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) by empowering them to analyze big data and extract patterns. ML/DL-based NIDS are trained using either flow-based or packet-based features. Flow-based NIDS are suitable for offline traffic analysis, while packet-based NIDS can analyze traffic and detect attacks in real-time. Current packet-based approaches analyze packets independently, overlooking the sequential nature of network communication. This results in biased models that exhibit increased false negatives and positives. Additionally, most literature-proposed packet-based NIDS capture only payload data, neglecting crucial information from packet headers. This oversight can impair the ability to identify header-level attacks, such as denial-of-service attacks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-enabled methodological framework for packet-based NIDS that effectively analyzes header and payload data and considers temporal connections among packets. Our framework transforms sequential packets into two-dimensional images. It then develops a convolutional neural network-based intrusion detection model to process these images and detect malicious activities. Through experiments using publicly available big datasets, we demonstrate that our framework is able to achieve high detection rates of 97.7% to 99% across different attack types and displays promising resilience against adversarial examples.",

        "abstract": "Smart agricultural decision support systems (DSS) leverage big data technology to generate efficient decision recommendations. However, missing values in sensor data can lead to cumulative errors and reduced accuracy in data analysis, compromising the precision of these decision systems. To address this issue, we propose an intelligent multi-factor prediction framework for smart agriculture environments. This framework utilizes fuzzy Bayesian data imputation to minimize filling errors and provide a reliable data foundation for decision systems. The framework includes a fuzzy Bayesian module for imputing missing data, resulting in complete datasets and enhancing interpretability. Additionally, a multi-factor prediction model is established within an encode-decode framework, incorporating dimension-temporal cross-attention layers to capture and extract correlations among multiple factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms single-factor prediction, achieving a 13.6% increase in correlation. These results validate the effectiveness of the imputation module in enhancing forecasting precision and reliability, thereby assisting agricultural DSS in meeting evolving demands.",

        "abstract": "With the development of Internet technology, deepfake (DF) videos can spread rapidly through online platforms, providing a new way of cyberbullying by generating nude pictures of female victims and using their faces to generate pornographic movies, which bring potential harm to individuals, society, and the country. Recently, there have been some really impressive results with DF detection models. These models have shown excellent outstanding performance when they are trained and tested using data from the same dataset. However, detecting DF remains difficult when the data comes from challenging datasets. To address this issue, this article aims to enhance the modelâs generalization by taking full advantage of the learning and representation capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adaptively suppress image texture information and catch deeper and more universal forgery features. Specifically, we introduce the texture suppression module (TSM) as a first step to suppress image content while simultaneously revealing the differences between authentic and tampered regions. Then, we carefully designed the cross stream interaction module (CSIM) and the cross stream mix block (CSMB) module to fully exploit the extracted forgery traces. Our proposed model has demonstrated superior generalization performance in extensive experiments.",

        "abstract": "Automated polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images is crucial for colorectal cancer diagnosis. The accuracy of such segmentation, however, is challenged by two main factors. First, the variability in polyps' size, shape, and color, coupled with the scarcity of well-annotated data due to the need for specialized manual annotation, hampers the efficacy of existing deep learning methods. Second, concealed polyps often blend with adjacent intestinal tissues, leading to poor contrast that challenges segmentation models. Recently, diffusion models have been explored and adapted for polyp segmentation tasks. However, the significant domain gap between RGB-colonoscopy images and grayscale segmentation masks, along with the low efficiency of the diffusion generation process, hinders the practical implementation of these models. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Highlighted Diffusion Model Plus (HDM+), a two-stage polyp segmentation framework. This framework incorporates the Highlighted Diffusion Model (HDM) to provide explicit semantic guidance, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy. In the initial stage, the HDM is trained using highlighted ground-truth data, which emphasizes polyp regions while suppressing the background in the images. This approach reduces the domain gap by focusing on the image itself rather than on the segmentation mask. In the subsequent second stage, we employ the highlighted features from the trained HDM's U-Net model as plug-in priors for polyp segmentation, rather than generating highlighted images, thereby increasing efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on six polyp segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "The Magnetically Controlled Capsule Endoscopy (MCCE) has a limited shooting range, resulting in capturing numerous fragmented images and an inability to precisely locate and examine the region of interest (ROI) as traditional endoscopy can. Addressing this issue, image stitching around the ROI can be employed to aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract conditions. However, MCCE images possess unique characteristics, such as weak texture, close-up shooting, and large angle rotation, presenting challenges to current image-matching methods. In this context, a method named S2P-Matching is proposed for self-supervised patch-based matching in MCCE image stitching. The method involves augmenting the raw data by simulating the capsule endoscopic camera's behavior around the GI tract's ROI. Subsequently, an improved contrast learning encoder is utilized to extract local features, represented as deep feature descriptors. This encoder comprises two branches that extract distinct scale features, which are combined over the channel without manual labeling. The data-driven descriptors are then input into a Transformer model to obtain patch-level matches by learning the globally consented matching priors in the pseudo-ground-truth match pairs. Finally, the patch-level matching is refined and filtered to the pixel-level. The experimental results on real-world MCCE images demonstrate that S2P-Matching provides enhanced accuracy in addressing challenging issues in the GI tract environment with image parallax. The performance improvement can reach up to 203 and 55.8% in terms of NCM (Number of Correct Matches) and SR (Success Rate), respectively. This approach is expected to facilitate the wide adoption of MCCE-based gastrointestinal screening.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation seeks to understand user preferences based on their past actions and predict future interactions with items. Recently, several techniques for sequential recommendation have emerged, primarily leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for their ability to model relationships effectively. However, real-world scenarios often involve sparse interactions, where early and recent short-term preferences play distinct roles in the recommendation process. Consequently, vanilla GCNs struggle to effectively capture the explicit correlations between these early and recent short-term preferences. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Graph Convolutional Networks with Collaborative Feature Fusion (COFF). Specifically, our method addresses the issue by initially dividing each user interaction sequence into two segments. We then construct two separate graphs for these segments, aiming to capture the user's early and recent short-term preferences independently. To obtain robust prediction, we employ multiple GCNs in a collaborative distillation manner, incorporating a feature fusion module to establish connections between the early and recent short-term preferences. This approach enables a more precise representation of user preferences. Experimental evaluations conducted on five popular sequential recommendation datasets demonstrate that our COFF model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Accurate traffic flow prediction is a key aspect of building data-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITS) which relies on the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors deployed along roads, and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies mining is a major area of interest in traffic flow prediction. Existing methods, however, overlook the diversities of traffic flow patterns from the perspectives of temporal and spatial dimensions. To this end, this paper presents a Multi-view Spatial-temporal Adaptive Transformer-GRU (MST-ATG) framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture to capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies from various perspectives. Specifically, a multi-view embedding layer (MEL) containing original traffic data and spatial-temporal correlated features is designed to enrich the feature encoding. Then, based on the inherent characteristics of traffic flow, we introduce a periodicity-trend decomposition (PTD) method to fully consider the periodic and trend-oriented features of time series. Finally, we propose a spatial-temporal adaptive transformer-GRU (ST-ATG) to dynamically extract spatial-temporal dependencies and adaptively choose computation steps in which a Temporal Adaptive stacked-GRU Module (T-AGM) is proposed to extract correlations in temporal dimension and spatial dependencies captured by a Spatial Adaptive Transformer Module (S-ATM). Experimental results on six large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our MST-ATG framework outperforms the benchmarks in prediction accuracy. For instance, the average RMSE of MST-ATG on PeMS08 is reduced by 48.3%, 41.09%, 12.95%, 17.67%, 18.64%, 2.4%, 14.67%, 9.15%, 1.1%, 2.4%, 2.51%, and 1.2% compared to that of ARIMA, LSTM, DCRNN, STGCN, ASTGCN, GWNet, STSGCN, AGCRN, Bi-STAT, STAEformer, PDFormer, and STPGNN, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative PTSQM model for the software development process of automotive powertrain electronic control systems. This model solves the problems that are faced in the research and development process of modern automotive powertrain systems by integrating the QFD quality method with the ASPICE standard model. This paper uses questionnaires and data statistics methods to analyze the requirements of the automotive electronics software R&D team. The model design is carried out in three different directions: demand management, change management, and quality management. The PTSQM model combines big data technology with the QFD method to efficiently and accurately realize the technical transformation from customer requirements to detailed module design. Furthermore, the practical application of the model in a powertrain development project is analyzed in this paper. The results show that the PTSQM model has achieved all the quality assurance activities in the effective development stage of the project. It also fulfils all the quality objectives. As a result, the overall quality of the software has been effectively improved. The practical data demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the PTSQM model, indicating that the model is suitable for the powertrain software development process, especially for those direct-to-customer companies.",

        "abstract": "In the era of quantitative investment, factor-based investing models are widely adopted in the construction of stock portfolios. These models explain the performance of individual stocks by a set of financial factors, e.g., market beta and company size. In industry, open investment platforms allow the online building of factor-based models, yet set a high bar on the engineering expertise of end-users. State-of-the-art visualization systems integrate the whole factor investing pipeline, but do not directly address domain users' core requests on ranking factors and stocks for portfolio construction. The current model lacks explainability, which downgrades its credibility with stock investors. To fill the gap in modeling, ranking, and visualizing stock time series for factor investment, we designed and implemented a visual analytics system, namely RankFIRST. The system offers built-in support for an established factor collection and a cross-sectional regression model viable for human interpretation. A hierarchical slope graph design is introduced according to the desired characteristics of good factors for stock investment. A novel firework chart is also invented extending the well-known candlestick chart for stock time series. We evaluated the system on the full-scale Chinese stock market data in the recent 30 years. Case studies and controlled user evaluation demonstrate the superiority of our system on factor investing, in comparison to both passive investing on stock indices and existing stock market visual analytics tools.",

        "abstract": "Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) aims to accurately identify radiated acoustic signals from ships in complex maritime environments. The challenges of this task lay in how to explore discriminative representation from complex and limited acoustic samples. Recently, various deep learning-based UATR methods have been proposed. However, their performance on real sonar-collected signals remains restricted. On one hand, most methods currently adopt different representation extraction strategies to extract features from acoustic signals such as time-frequency representation, wave representation, and joint representation. However, the limited feature representation capability and simple feature fusion strategies often limit the recognition performance improvement. On the other hand, they often overlook the knowledge gains brought by pre-trained models and the extraction of multi-feature semantic correlation knowledge. This leads to unsatisfactory performance and even overfitting issues. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a Multi-Feature Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition method (MF-UATR). It introduces a strongly generalized multi-modal pre-trained language-audio model and contrastive learning based feature-level fusion strategy to semantically guide and fuse multiple features. This strategy facilitates the model in learning prior knowledge and the semantic correlations between features thereby improving recognition performance. Additionally, we also considered the few-shot scenarios with extremely limited data, in which a Multi-Modal Few-Shot Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (MMFS-UATR) scheme is proposed. It efficiently completes the few-shot underwater acoustic target recognition task by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, semantic supervision strategy, and pre-trained MF-UATR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, DeepShip and ShipsEar, demonstrate that the proposed frameworks achieve optimal target recogni...",

        "abstract": "Monotonic classification is a special ordinal classification task that involves monotonicity constraints between features and the decision. Monotonic feature selection can reduce dimensionality while preserving the monotonicity constraints, ultimately improving the efficiency and performance of monotonic classifiers. However, existing feature selection algorithms cannot handle large-scale monotonic data sets due to their lack of consideration for monotonic constraints or their high computational complexities. To address these issues, building on our team's previous research, we define the monotonic related family method with lower time complexity to select informative features and obtain multi-reducts carrying complementary information from multi-view for raw feature space. Using bi-directional rank mutual information, we build two trees for each feature subset and fuse all trees using the corresponding decision support level (BFMDT). Compared with six representative algorithms for monotonic feature selection, BFMDT's average classification accuracy increased by4.06% (FFREMT), 6.77% (FCMT), 5.61% (FPRS up), 6.05% (FPRS down), 5.86%(FPRS global), 4.41% (Bagging), 7.65% (REMT) and 21.89% (FMKNN), the average execution time compared to tree-based algorithms decreased by 83.41% (FFREMT), 96.96% (FCMT), 75.64% (FPRS up), 59.43% (FPRS down), 84.65%(FPRS global), 81.50% (Bagging) and 63.41% (REMT), while most of comparing algorithms were unable to complete computation on six high-dimensional datasets.",

        "abstract": "TNL (Tracking by Natural Language) aims to locate the target described by a natural language sentence in a video. Most existing TNL methods are typically composed of three modules: object grounding, object tracking, and switching module, and their performance is limited by the poor performance of the grounding and switching modules due to the complex backgrounds and inaccurate information stored in the memory. This paper presents a global-local framework to address these issues, which includes a prompt-guided grounding module, a trained local tracking module, and a memory-based switcher module. The prompt-guided grounding module uses noun prompts to guide the CLIP model in focusing more on target regions and aligning visual features semantically with linguistic features, avoiding being misled by distractors and background. The memory-based switch module stores historical information with higher-quality memory, allowing the model to make more accurate decisions based on reliable data, thus improving the overall performance. Experiments on TNL2K, LaSOT, and OTB-Lang demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Sequential causal effect estimation has recently attracted increasing attention from research and industry. While the existing models have achieved many successes, there are still many limitations. Existing models usually assume the causal graphs to be sufficient, i.e., there are no latent factors, such as the unmeasured confounders and instrumental variables. However, in real-world scenarios, it is hard to record all of the factors in the observational data, which makes the causally sufficient assumptions not hold. Moreover, existing models mainly focus on discrete treatments rather than continuous ones. To alleviate the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel C ontinous C ausal M odel by explicitly capturing the L atent F actors (called C $^{2}$ M-LF for short). Specifically, we define a sequential causal graph by simultaneously considering the unmeasured confounders and instrumental variables. Second, we describe the independence that should be satisfied among different variables from the mutual information perspective and further propose our learning objective. Then, we reweight different samples in the continuous treatment space to optimize our model unbiasedly. Beyond the above designs, we also theoretically analyze our model's causal identifiability and unbiasedness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

Fortunately, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks (e.g., Starlink) offer a more cost-effective solution for increasing edge clouds, and hence large volumes of data in edge clouds can be transferred to a core cloud via those networks for time-sensitive big data tasks processing, such as real-time data analysis. However, the state-of-the-art satellite selection algorithms bring poor performance for those processing via our measurements. Therefore, we propose a novel Data Volume Aware satellite selection algorithm, named, to support such big data processing tasks. first takes into account both the data size in edge clouds and satellite capacity to finalize the selection, thereby preventing congestion in the access network and reducing transmitting duration. Extensive simulations validate that has a significantly lower average access network duration than the state-of-the-art satellite selection algorithms in a LEO satellite emulation platform.",

        "abstract": "6G (sixth-generation wireless), the successor to 5G cellular technology, operates at higher frequencies than its predecessor and supports significantly greater capacity and markedly reduced latency. Healthcare is treated as a complex system with various stakeholders, like doctors, patients, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies as well as healthcare decision-makers. The innovations in the Internet of Things (IoT) and incorporating emerging technology in the healthcare systems provide the quality of services to the people and save millions of lives. However, patient privacy and secure interchange of medical data from various healthcare providers need to be adequately addressed. Furthermore, incorporating blockchain in the healthcare system helps to make the system more transparent and secure due to inherent properties of the blockchain. In addition, Big Data analytics helps in analyzing large datasets from hundreds of patients, and then in identifying various clusters and correlation among datasets, and also in developing predictive models. In this paper, we aim to propose a new smart contract-based access control for 6G-enabled blockchain assisted in the healthcare system (in short, we call it as SACS). SACS provides a patient to communicate with its healthcare management authority securely and helps to interchange his/her medical information across healthcare providers. A detailed security analysis, experimental results and comparative study assure that the proposed SACS is secure by preventing possible active and passive attacks, and requires less computational and communication costs as compared to those for other relevant competing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Uplift modeling is a widely recognized predictive approach used to identify individuals who are more likely to respond positively to an intervention or treatment, such as a marketing campaign. However, this approach can be negatively affected by the class-imbalance problem, which occurs when the distribution of target classes is highly skewed. For instance, in a class-imbalanced uplift modeling task, only a small fraction typically responds to a marketing campaign that leads to a purchase. In this paper, we propose a novel resampling scheme that addresses the class-imbalance issue by combining intelligent oversampling and propensity score matching (PSM). By leveraging intelligent oversampling in observational studies, we alleviate the class-imbalance problem and mitigate the negative effects of PSM in terms of information loss. We introduce two efficient resampling schemes that intelligently combine these approaches. To ensure scalability and effectiveness, we adopt a distributed framework based on MapReduce and utilize a hybrid spill trees algorithm for efficient nearest neighbor search. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, achieving statistically superior predictive performance compared to other resampling approaches while maintaining efficiency in terms of overall running times.",

        "abstract": "In Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can improve the system performance and communication range of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, the resource allocation and computation offloading in UAVs-assisted IoV systems still face huge challenges due to the growing number of Vehicle Terminals (VTs), potential privacy leakage, and inefficient problem-solving. Existing solutions cannot adapt to such dynamic multi-UAV scenarios and meet the real-time requirements of VTs. To address these challenges, we propose RACOMU, a novel Resource Allocation and Collaborative Offloading framework for Multi-UAV-assisted IoV. First, we introduce the convex optimization theory to decouple the original problem and then obtain the near-optimal allocation of transmission power and computing resources by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. Next, we design a new collaborative offloading strategy with Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL), where the offloading requests from VTs are processed in a distributed manner to approach the global optimum while preserving data privacy. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed RACOMU. Compared to benchmark methods, RACOMU achieves better performance in terms of task processing latency, decision-making time, and load balancing degree under various scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Online marketplaces often collect products to sell from several other platforms (and sellers) and produce a unique ranking/score of these products to users. Keeping as private the user preferences provided in each (individual) platform is a need and a challenge at the same time. We are currently used to rating items in the marketplace itself which, in turn, can produce more effective rankings. Hence, the shaping of an effective item ranking would require a sharing of the user ratings between the individual platforms and the marketplace, thus impacting users' privacy. In this paper, we propose the initial steps towards a change of paradigm, where the ratings are kept as private in each platform. Under this paradigm, each platform produces its rankings, then aggregated by the marketplace, in a federated fashion. To ensure that the marketplace's rankings maintain their effectiveness, we exploit the concept of reputation of the individual platform , so that the final marketplace ranking is weighted by the reputation of each platform providing its ranking. Experiments on three datasets, covering different use cases, show that our approach can produce effective rankings, improving robustness to attacks, while keeping user preference data private within each seller platform.",

        "abstract": "In the realm of medical data processing, particularly in the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac diseases, the analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals represents a critical challenge, especially with the burgeoning volume of ECG big data. Traditional methods and existing research often fall short in effectively analyzing this data, limited by their inability to fully capture the complex and nonlinear patterns inherent in ECG signals. Addressing these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a novel deep neuro-fuzzy model augmented with multimodal feature fusion. Our method ingeniously combines the power of neurofuzzy systems with the robust feature extraction capabilities of deep learning, specifically leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, to analyze both ECG signals and their corresponding spectral images. This multimodal fusion not only enriches the model's input data, providing a comprehensive understanding of cardiac signals, but also enhances the adaptability and accuracy of cardiac arrhythmia detection. We rigorously validate our approach on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, conducting a series of experiments, including performance evaluations and ablation studies, to highlight the significant contributions of the multimodal feature fusion and neuro-fuzzy module. The results achieve significant improvements in classification metrics: an accuracy of 98.46% and an F1 score of 99.1%. Moreover, we benchmark the Transformer's feature extraction performance against other architectures like ResNet. The results unequivocally demonstrate our model's superiority and illustrate the potential of integrated neuro-fuzzy and deep learning approaches in overcoming the current limitations of ECG signal analysis.",

        "abstract": "Long-tailed (LT) classification is an unavoidable and challenging problem in the real world. Most existing long-tailed classification methods focus only on solving the class-wise imbalance while ignoring the attribute-wise imbalance. The deviation of a classification model is caused by both class-wise and attribute-wise imbalance. Due to the fact that attributes are implicit in most datasets and the combination of attributes is complex, attribute-wise imbalance is more difficult to handle. For this purpose, we proposed a novel long-tailed classification framework, aiming to build a multi-granularity classification model by means of invariant feature learning. This method first unsupervisedly constructs Coarse-Grained Leading Forest (CLF) to better characterize the distribution of attributes within a class. Depending on the distribution of attributes, one can customize suitable sampling strategies to construct different imbalanced datasets. We then introduce multi-center loss (MCL) that aims to gradually eliminate confusing attributes during feature learning process. The proposed framework does not necessarily couple to a specific LT classification model structure and can be integrated with any existing LT method as an independent component. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing benchmarks ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT and can improve the performance of existing LT methods.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, several few-shot learning (FSL) approaches for industrial equipment fault diagnosis have emerged to tackle the challenges posed by small fault diagnosis datasets. However, the existing FSL approaches model the correlation between input and output variables while ignoring causality, which cannot ensure that the diagnosis results are interpretable and robust. To tackle this problem, this article introduces a causal intervention relation network for cross-component few-shot fault diagnosis from the causal perspective. The model comprises a feature encoding module, a causal intervention module, and a relation measure module. The feature encoding module and the relation measure module establish a trainable similarity metric space through the training of multiple metatasks, where they learn the feature distances between sample pairs. Importantly, in causal intervention module, we model the causal structure of the metalearning process of few-shot fault diagnosis to find the causal fault features and the confounder factor, i.e., the metatraining diagnosis knowledge. Correspondingly a backdoor adjustment approach via a combination of class-based adjustment and feature adjustment is designed to realize the causal calibration of the few-shot fault diagnosis model. In such way, the model can capture causal invariant features between various components with significant distributional differences, thus enhancing the model's interpretability and its capacity for generalization. We perform experiments on two openly accessible datasets and a dataset constructed in our laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor network plays a crucial role in sensing everything in Internet of Everything (IoE) applications. Network reliability, which measures the ability of the network to satisfy specific requirements, is one of the core factors influencing the quality of service of the network and a vital support for ensuring the normal operation of IoE applications. Existing reliability evaluation methods are mainly based on minimum cutsets or paths, which are inefficient and not suitable for large-scale networks. Furthermore, most work either focuses on coverage functionality or connectivity functionality, lacking energy awareness. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional Target Full-Coverage Reliability (TFCR). TFCR comprehensively considers various factors affecting network reliability. To evaluate TFCR, a graph-empowered CIC and Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR)-based Energy-aware Reliability Algorithm (CSERA) is proposed. This algorithm evaluates network coverage based on the confident information coverage (CIC) model. Additionally, graph neural networks and the SINR-based Fade Tail Connectivity (FTC) model are used to evaluate network connectivity functionality. CSERA balances computational accuracy and efficiency, providing reliability evaluation values within an acceptable margin of error. Extensive simulations and comparative experiments from multiple perspectives demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method CSERA over existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Social relationships offer crucial supplementary information for recommendations by leveraging usersâ social connections to gain insights into their preferences. However, prevalent social recommendation methods often grapple with the issues of sparsity and noise, which curtail their effectiveness. In addition, these methods overlook the intricacies of user interactions within social networks, which could provide invaluable information. Addressing their deficiencies, this article introduces a novel sociological-theory-based multitopic self-supervised recommendation method (SMSR). This method integrates user attitude information into the construction of social relationships and utilizes dynamic routing to identify and categorize topics, thereby mitigating the impact of social noise on recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we reveal sophisticated higher order user relations within these topics by using motifs. By combining the light graph convolutional network with balance theory, SMSR efficiently aggregates information from diverse social relations to gain its outstanding performance. Moreover, we have devised and integrated four self-supervised signals, inspired by social theory and derived from heterogeneous graph analysis, to more effectively exploit the rich structural and semantic information inherent in social relationship graphs. Empirical results from extensive experiments on publicly available datasets underscore SMSRâs superiority over the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal neural architecture search (MNAS) is an effective approach to obtain task-adaptive multi-modal classification models. Deep neural networks, as currently mainstream feature extractors, can provide hierarchical features for each modality. Existing MNAS methods face difficulty in exploiting such hierarchical features due to their different form coexistence such as tensorial multi-scale features and vectorized penultimate features. Moreover, existing methods always focus on the evolution of fusion operators or vectorized features of all modalities, constraining search space. In this paper, a novel two-stage method called multi-modal multi-scale evolutionary neural architecture search (MM-ENAS) is proposed. The first stage unifies the representation form of hierarchical features by the proposed evolutionary statistics strategy. The second stage identifies the optimal combination of basic fusion operations for all unified hierarchical features by the evolutionary algorithm. MM-ENAS increases search space by simultaneously searching for feature statistical extraction methods, basic fusion operators and feature representation set consisting of tensorial multi-scale features and vectorized penultimate features. Experimental results on three multi-modal tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy, search time, and number of parameters compared to existing representative MNAS methods. Additionally, the method exhibits fast adaptation to various multi-modal tasks.",

        "abstract": "Deep multiview clustering methods have achieved remarkable performance. However, all of them failed to consider the difficulty labels (uncertainty of ground truth for training samples) over multiview samples, which may result in a nonideal clustering network for getting stuck into poor local optima during the training process; worse still, the difficulty labels from the multiview samples are always inconsistent, and such a fact makes it even more challenging to handle. In this article, we propose a novel deep adversarial inconsistent cognitive sampling (DAICS) method for multiview progressive subspace clustering. A multiview binary classification (easy or difficult) loss and a feature similarity loss are proposed to jointly learn a binary classifier and a deep consistent feature embedding network, throughout an adversarial minimax game over difficulty labels of multiview consistent samples. We develop a multiview cognitive sampling strategy to select the input samples from easy to difficult for multiview clustering network training. However, the distributions of easy and difficult samples are mixed together, hence not trivial to achieve the goal. To resolve it, we define a sampling probability with a theoretical guarantee. Based on that, a golden section mechanism is further designed to generate a sample set boundary to progressively select the samples with varied difficulty labels via a gate unit, which is utilized to jointly learn a multiview common progressive subspace and clustering network for more efficient clustering. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DAICS over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "A mixed traffic flow with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will persist for a long time. It is essential to utilize the limited road resources of freeways to improve traffic efficiency in the traffic flow environment. To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimization model for freeway lane management strategies. Firstly, three lane management strategies, dedicated lane (DL), general lane (GL), and mixed lane (ML), are introduced. Secondly, the capacity model of different lane management strategies is derived based on headway and its probability. Then, an optimization model for freeway lane management is developed. The objective function is freeway throughput, and the constraints are traffic demand, heterogeneous traffic flow distribution balance, and fair allocation of road resources for heterogeneous traffic flow. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that (1) the throughput of freeway segments increases with the penetration rate (PR) of CAVs; (2) when the PR reaches a certain level, the formation of CAVs platoons has a significant impact on the throughput of freeways; (3) different lane management strategies exhibit significant differences in the throughput of freeways. Given the traffic demand and PR, there is an optimal combination of lane management strategies. Therefore, the proposed model can theoretically support lane management of freeways in the mixed traffic environment.",

        "abstract": "Robotic autonomous ultrasound imaging is a challenging task as robots require strong analytical capabilities to make sound decisions in complex spatial relationships. In this paper, we integrate visual and tactile information into the ultrasound robotic system drawing inspiration from the process of human doctors conducting ultrasound scans, and explore the impact of different modalities of information on our task. The proposed multimodal deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework can integrate real-time visual feedback and tactile perception, and directly output 6D pose decisions to control the ultrasound probe, thereby achieving fully autonomous ultrasound imaging of soft, movable, and unmarked targets. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a simulation platform and propose an effective model transfer learning method. Subsequently, we conducted further evaluations of the approach in a real-world environment. The results indicate that our approach effectively enhances the performance of autonomous ultrasound scanning and manual adjustments further optimize the outcomes. Note to Practitioners âThis work is motivated by the increasing demand for intelligent human-machine interaction in medical applications. By improving the automation of traditional medical scanning procedures such as ultrasound scanning, the efficiency of medical scanning can be greatly improved. In this work, we propose a multi-modal autonomous ultrasound scanning system based on DRL, which can be applied to improve the efficiency of human-machine interaction in medical environments to execute daily health screening or used in emergency situations.",

        "abstract": "Crack detection is a fundamental effort to ensure road driving safety, aiming to detect potential safety hazards and avoid serious accidents. However, cracks can not be extracted completely and accurately due to problems such as low contrast, high noise, and complex topology of pavement cracks. To address these issues, we propose a directional connectivity feature enhancement network for pavement crack detection. In this network, we build multi-directional enhanced convolution to capture the complex topology of cracks, which is more sensitive to long cracks. To leverage both low-level detail information and high-level semantic information in the network, a novel multi-scale fusion attention is constructed to strengthen the mutual guidance of crack information between channels. The directional connectivity is introducted to establish loss module, which enhances the position and direction information between neighbouring pixels and further refines the crack edge features. To validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method, we experiment on six publicly available crack datasets, DeepCrack, Crack500, CFD, DCD, EdmCrack600 and DCCE. Compared to other networks, our network achieves 2.2% improvement in ODS and 1.8% improvement in MIoU on the DeepCrack dataset, and 1.2% improvement in ODS and 0.9% improvement in MIoU on the Crack500 dataset.

        "abstract": "Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) provide descriptions of the concurrent behaviors for software and hardware. Model checking based on CPNs is an effective method to simulate and verify the concurrent behavior in system design. However, the model checking method traverses the full state space, which suffers from the state space explosion problem. A reduced state space generation method related to the property of concurrent systems is proposed. Specifically, we extend CPNs to define a property-related model (CPN-PR) and give a property-related analysis method whose results can be used to generate the CPN-PR model. A reduced state space generation method is developed based on enabled binding element filtering rules. The stutter trace equivalence between the state spaces of CPN and CPN-PR has been proven by showing that the reduced state space may not change the model checking result. A comparison experiment is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Along with the increasing popularization of social platforms, rumors in the Web environment have become one of the significant threats to human society. Existing rumor detection methods ignore modeling and analyzing the community structure of the rumor propagation network. This article proposes a new community-enhanced dynamic graph convolutional network (CDGCN) for effective rumor detection on online social networks, which utilize the communities formed in a rumor propagation process to improve rumor detection accuracy. CDGCN uses a designed method that combines node features and topology features to identify the communities and learn the community features of rumors. Following this, a graph convolutional network (GCN) with a community-aware attention mechanism is proposed to enable the nodes to dynamically aggregate information from their neighboring nodesâ global and community features, effectively prioritizing critical neighborhood information, enhancing the representation of both local community structures and global network patterns for improved analytical performance. The final rumor representations generated by the GCN are processed by a classifier to detect false rumors. Comprehensive experiments and comparison studies are conducted on four real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of CDGCN.",

        "abstract": "With the advantages of seamless coverage and ubiquitous connections, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) composed of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can provide content caching services for future Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to satisfy onboard collaborative viewing, traffic sensing, and metaverse entertainments in remote areas. However, the heterogeneous caching hardware, communication environments, and frequent network dynamics make the optimization of content caching policy highly complicated. Firstly, considering all LEO satellites as caching satellites can lead to content duplication and radio interference, causing storage waste and NTN transmission quality deterioration. Secondly, how to provide customized QoS by intra-layer and inter-layer cooperative caching in such complicated environments remains an open issue. Thus, we propose a Delay-Motivated Ant Colony Optimization (DM-ACO) scheme to select caching LEO satellites with reduced system propagation delay. Then, the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Hierarchical Caching and Asynchronous Updating (MADRL-HCAU) strategy is designed to manage the caching capacity of LEO satellites and UAVs, providing customized services for CAVs and dispensing the peak traffic. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can not only effectively accelerate the caching refreshing and content downloading process but also significantly reduce the packet drop and improve the cache hit ratio.",

        "abstract": "Currently, small object detection in complex traffic scenarios remains a major challenge due to variations in object shape, scales, and external environment, as well as a high interclass similarity. Although the latest algorithms achieve high accuracy, the results for small objects are still unsatisfactory. To obtain satisfactory small object detection results, the YOLOv8 algorithm is used to construct a feature fusion network with multiscale adaptively attentional (MAAFFNet). Firstly, the C2f module is modified to replace the simple summation operation with Multiscale Iterative Attentional Feature Fusion (MSIAFF), which enhances the ability of multi-scale aggregation of the C2f module and suppresses the interference of irrelevant information, resulting in a richer semantic feature map. Secondly, the adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) module is introduced to deal with the feature maps of different scales, allocate the weights of spatial features of different levels, and enhance the consistency of semantic information between each layer of the feature maps, so as to improve the detail richness of the network. Finally, to achieve more accurate classification of small objects, a Slide loss function is introduced to achieve object classification and localization. Our proposed algorithm has been extensively experimented on KITTI, COCO-traffic and VOC 2012 datasets, respectively, comparing the proposed method to popular twostage and single-stage object detection algorithms, the proposed method performs well in terms of accuracy",

        "abstract": "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) based Federated Learning (FL) can achieve the massive connectivity of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, high transmission rate, and pervasive intelligence in 6G networks. However, the stochastic channels and frequent model parameter updates may incur degraded transmission rate and diminished FL performance, while privacy leakage may happen if Eavesdroppers (Eves) intercept the FL training process. To address the above issues, we exploit Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) to reconfigure wireless signal propagation for secure transmission and fast convergence of NOMA-based FL. In this article, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approach is proposed to jointly optimize the transmission power of edge devices and IRS phase shift to maximize the minimum secrecy rate in the model parameter uploading process. Numerical results validate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that IRS can improve the secrecy rate.",

        "abstract": "Sliding window aggregation, which extracts summaries from data streams, is a core operation in streaming analysis. Though existing sliding window algorithms that perform single eviction and insertion operations can achieve a worst-case time complexity of\nO(1)\nfor in-order streams, real-world data streams often involve out-of-order data and exhibit burst data characteristics, which pose performance challenges to these sliding window algorithms. To address this challenging issue, we propose Gecko - a novel sliding window aggregation algorithm that supports bulk eviction. Gecko leverages a granular-based eviction strategy for various bulk sizes, enabling efficient bulk eviction while maintaining the performance close to that of in-order stream algorithms for single evictions. For large data bulks, Gecko performs coarse-grained eviction at the chunk level, followed by fine-grained eviction using leftward binary tree aggregation (LTA) as a complementary method. Moreover, Gecko partitions data based on chunks to prevent the impacts of out-of-order data on other chunks, thereby enabling efficient handling of out-of-order data streams. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Gecko. Experimental results demonstrate that Gecko exhibits superior performance over other solutions, which is consistent with theoretical expectations. In real-world data scenarios, Gecko improves the average throughput of the state-of-the-art algorithm b_FiBA by 1.7 times, with a maximum improvement of up to 3.5 times. Gecko also demonstrates the best latency performance among all compared schemes.",

        "abstract": "As a key technique for future networks, the performance of emerging multi-edge caching is often limited by inefficient collaboration among edge nodes and improper resource configuration. Meanwhile, achieving optimal cache hit rates poses substantive challenges without effectively capturing the potential relations between discrete user features and diverse content libraries. These challenges become further sophisticated when caching schemes are exposed to adversarial attacks that seriously impair cache performance. To address these challenges, we introduce RoCoCache , a resilient collaborative caching framework that uniquely integrates robust federated deep learning with proactive caching strategies, enhancing performance under adversarial conditions. First, we design a novel partitioning mechanism for multi-dimensional cache space, enabling precise content recommendations in user classification intervals. Next, we develop a new Discrete-Categorical Variational Auto-Encoder (DC-VAE) to accurately predict content popularity by overcoming posterior collapse. Finally, we create an original training mode and proactive cache replacement strategy based on robust federated deep learning. Notably, the residual-based detection for adversarial model updates and similarity-based federated aggregation are integrated to avoid the model destruction caused by adversarial updates, which enables the proactive cache replacement adapting to optimized cache resources and thus enhances cache performance. Using the real-world testbed and datasets, extensive experiments verify that the RoCoCache achieves higher cache hit rates and efficiency than state-of-the-art methods while ensuring better robustness. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the components designed in RoCoCache for improving cache performance via ablation studies.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most important production factors in the digital economy era, data holds significant value for social production and development. Energy enterprises possess a wealth of interconnected data resources closely linked to various industries. Therefore, effectively monetizing this invaluable data is crucial for unlocking its potential. This paper explores the process of data monetization by constructing game models that consider the data trading market involving an enterprise and a third-party platform. The findings show that enterprises and platforms can optimize their profits by adjusting the wholesale price of data and the intensity of data value mining to achieve a favorable equilibrium state. Moreover, complex dynamic characteristics occur when considering multi-period repeated games, and it is important for decision-makers to keep adjustment parameters and initial states within reasonable ranges to avoid market failure. Finally, strategic insights and recommendations are provided based on both theoretical and numerical analyses to guide enterprise decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Stable learning aims to leverage the knowledge in a relevant source domain to learn a prediction model that can generalize well to target domains. Recent advances in stable learning mainly proceed by eliminating spurious correlations between irrelevant features and labels through sample reweighting or causal feature selection. However, most existing stable learning methods either only weaken partial spurious correlations or discard part of true causal relationships, resulting in generalization performance degradation. To tackle these issues, we propose the Dual Feature Learning (DFL) algorithm for stable learning, which consists of two phases. Phase 1 first learns a set of sample weights to balance the distribution of treated and control groups corresponding to each feature, and then uses the learned sample weights to assist feature selection to identify part of irrelevant features for completely isolating spurious correlations between these irrelevant features and labels. Phase 2 first learns two groups of sample weights again using the subdataset after feature selection, and then obtains high-quality feature representations by integrating a weighted cross-entropy model and an autoencoder model to further get rid of spurious correlations. Using synthetic and four real-world datasets, the experiments have verified the effectiveness of DFL, in comparison with eleven state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of big data, Federated learning (FL) has found numerous applications, enabling machine learning (ML) on edge devices while preserving privacy. However, FL still faces crucial challenges, such as single point of failure and poisoning attacks, which motivate the integration of blockchain-enabled FL (BeFL). Beyond that, the efficiency issue still limits the further application of BeFL. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized framework: Accelerating Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning with Clustered Clients (ABFLCC), who utilize actual training time for clustering clients to achieve hierarchical FL and solve the single point of failure problem through blockchain. Additionally, the framework clusters edge devices considering their actual training times, which allows for synchronous FL within clusters and asynchronous FL across clusters simultaneously. This approach guarantees that devices with a similar training time have a consistent global model version, improving the stability of the converging process, while the asynchronous learning between clusters enhances the efficiency of convergence. The proposed framework is evaluated through simulations on three real-world public datasets, demonstrating a training efficiency improvement of 30% to 70% in terms of convergence time compared to existing BeFL systems.",

        "abstract": "A knowledge graph (KG) is a form of representing knowledge of the objective world. With the expansion of knowledge, KGs frequently incorporate new entities, which often possess limited associated data, known as few-shot features. Addressing the missing knowledge for these emerging entities is crucial practically, but there are significant challenges due to data scarcity. Previously developed methods based on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) and graph neural networks (GNNs) focusing on instance-level KGs are confronted with challenges of data scarcity and model simplicity, rendering them inapplicable to reasoning tasks in few-shot scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose a multi-view few-shot KG reasoning method for emerging entities. The primary focus of our method lies in resolving the problem of link prediction for emerging entities with limited associated triples from multiple perspectives. Distinct from previous methods, our approach initially abstracts a concept-view KG from the conventional instance-view KG, enabling the formulation of commonsense rules. Additionally, we employ the aggregation of multi-hop subgraph features to enhance the representation of emerging entities. Furthermore, we introduce a more efficient cross-domain negative sampling strategy and a multi-view triple scoring function based on commonsense rules. Our experimental evaluations highlight the effectiveness of our method in few-shot contexts, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in both cross-shot and zero-shot scenarios, significantly outperforming existing models in these challenging settings.",

        "abstract": "Multiview attribute graph clustering aims to cluster nodes into disjoint categories by taking advantage of the multiview topological structures and the node attribute values. However, the existing works fail to explicitly discover the inherent relationships in multiview topological graph matrices while considering different properties between the graphs. Besides, they cannot well handle the sparse structure of some graphs in the learning procedure of graph embeddings. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel contrastive multiview attribute graph clustering (CMAGC) with adaptive encoders method. Within this framework, the adaptive encoders concerning different properties of distinct topological graphs are chosen to integrate multiview attribute graph information by checking whether there exists high-order neighbor information or not. Meanwhile, the number of layers of the GCN encoders is selected according to the prior knowledge related to the characteristics of different topological graphs. In particular, the feature-level and cluster-level contrastive learning are conducted on the multiview soft assignment representations, where the union of the first-order neighbors from the corresponding graph pairs is regarded as the positive pairs for data augmentation and the sparse neighbor information problem in some graphs can be well dealt with. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to explicitly deal with the inherent relationships from the interview and intraview perspectives. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets to verify the superiority of the proposed CMAGC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Subspace analysis of high-dimensional data is extremely challenging due to the huge exploration space. We propose Subspace-Map, a novel approach with a map metaphor for interactive exploration of various subspaces. We utilize a subspace search algorithm to identify a moderate number of potentially valuable subspaces, each visualized as a city on the map. Similar cities are clustered into provinces and countries, highlighting common data and dimensional patterns that can guide users in constructing desired subspaces. With the map, users can grasp an overview of the exploration space and explore different subspaces via recommended tour routes in more detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Subspace-Map through cases with real-world data, experiments with user feedback, and a comparison with state-of-the-art subspace data visualizations.",

        "abstract": "Mixed-precision quantization mostly predetermines the model bit-width settings before actual training due to the non-differential bit-width sampling process, obtaining suboptimal performance. Worse still, the conventional static quality-consistent training setting, i.e., all data is assumed to be of the same quality across training and inference, overlooks data quality changes in real-world applications which may lead to poor robustness of the quantized models. In this article, we propose a novel data quality-aware mixed-precision quantization framework, dubbed DQMQ, to dynamically adapt quantization bit-widths to different data qualities. The adaption is based on a bit-width decision policy that can be learned jointly with the quantization training. Concretely, DQMQ is modeled as a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) task that combines model-based policy optimization with supervised quantization training. By relaxing the discrete bit-width sampling to a continuous probability distribution that is encoded with few learnable parameters, DQMQ is differentiable and can be directly optimized end-to-end with a hybrid optimization target considering both task performance and quantization benefits. Trained on mixed-quality image datasets, DQMQ can implicitly select the most proper bit-width for each layer when facing uneven input qualities. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and networks demonstrate the superiority of DQMQ against existing fixed/mixed-precision quantization methods.",

Traditional approaches often face challenges due to the sheer volume of data, difficulty in extracting meaningful features, limitations in model complexity, and the requirement for real-time analysis in clinical settings.

The MDNFN is designed to address the complexity of arrhythmia classification by incorporating deep learning and fuzzy logic processing across multiscale feature extraction. To optimize the performance of the MDNFN, an innovative model optimization technique based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced, offering an efficient exploration of the parameter space. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to existing methods. The MDNFN demonstrates heightened accuracy and robustness, supported by its adaptability to different frequency and time scales inherent in ECG signals. The study establishes the model's efficacy through comprehensive experimentation, providing compelling evidence for its potential application in real-world clinical scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, cross-domain recommendation has gained great attention to resolve the cold-start issue. Many existing cross-domain recommendation methods model a preference bridge between the source and target domains to transfer preferences by the overlapping users. However, when there are insufficient cross-domain users available to bridge the two domains, it will negatively impact the recommender systemâs accuracy (ACC) and performance. Therefore, in this article, we propose to create a link between the source and the target domains by leveraging knowledge graph (KG) as the auxiliary information, and propose a novel knowledge-reinforced cross-domain recommendation (KR-CDR) method. First of all, we construct a new cross-domain KG (CDKG) by using the KGs that represent the source and target domains, respectively. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with meta learning on CDKG to discover meta-paths between the source and target domains. With these meta-paths, we obtain meta-path aggregated embedding vectors for cold-start users. Ultimately, the predicted rating can be acquired from the user meta-path aggregated embedding vector and item embedding vector. Experiments carried out on five real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) content is a crucial indicator for assessing soil fertility, and serves as a key factor in sustaining a viable agricultural system. With the continuous advancement and improvement of remote sensing technology, hyperspectral imagery has been employed for the monitoring of SOM. While the numerous bands reveal finer details within the spectral features, this also brings information redundancy and noise interference. Currently, the dimensionality reduction methods designed for hyperspectral imagery encounter difficulties in achieving optimal band combinations. As a result, swiftly and accurately capturing the spectral features of SOM becomes a challenging task. In this paper, aiming to address the inefficiency and instability in hyperspectral feature selection, we propose a metaheuristic-based algorithmâthe improved weighted marine predators algorithm (IWMPA)âfor hyperspectral feature selection. Specifically, we simulated the process of hyperspectral feature selection using the foraging strategy of marine predators. We employed prior weight coefficients and reverse learning operations in the initialization phase to accelerate the convergence of the population, and introduced mutation operations into the phase of development to prevent the occurrence of local optima traps. We employed the IWMPA feature selection method to establish SOM estimation models within the research area of Yitong Manchu Autonomous County in China. The results demonstrated that the hyperspectral features selected using the IWMPA approach yield favorable outcomes in the SOM estimation models. Specifically, in the best-performing regression model of this study, the R 2 on the test set was 0.7225. These experimental results suggest that, in comparison to the existing methods, the proposed IWMPA method is more adept at capturing the spectral features of SOM.",

        "abstract": "The cellular Internet of Things (IoT) enhanced by Federated learning (FL) is a potential paradigm to leverage the vast amount of data generated by the IoT devices and offer various intelligent applications. Through its distributed learning manner, the privacy and delay problems of the learning process are well handled. Nevertheless, in the cellular IoT, FL requires multiple rounds of model parameters exchanging between the parameter server and multiple clients over unstable wireless links, which largely constrains the communication efficiency. Regarding this problem, we propose the training data cost ratio to evaluate the communication efficiency, and then by maximizing this metric, client scheduling, transmitting power and bandwidth are jointly formulated. The formulated problem is decomposed via problem transformation and derivations, and then, the Lagrange method and greedy based algorithms are developed to solve the subproblems efficiently. Simulation results verify the advantages of our algorithm in communication efficiency improvement. Moreover, it reveals that the proposed metric and joint optimization substantially obtain superior tradeoff between learning performance and resource consumption compared to the client number oriented optimization.",

        "abstract": "Causal feature selection as an emerging topic has drawn increasing attention in the field of causal discovery and machine learning. However, existing causal feature selection algorithms do not consider the class imbalance problem, thus affecting the accuracy of measuring relationships between the class variable and the features with imbalanced data. To address this issue, we theoretically analyze the weighted mutual information relationships between the class variable and its causal features through feature relevance, redundancy, and complementarity, and propose a W eighted- C ausal F eature S election algorithm (W-CFS). Specifically, W-CFS uses weighted mutual information to discriminate between minority and majority classes, to accurately discover the Markov blanket of the class variable with imbalanced data. The comprehensive experimental results on imbalanced benchmark Bayesian networks datasets and imbalanced real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better accuracy and comparable efficiency in comparison to State-of-the-Art competitors.",

        "abstract": "Feature sparse problem is commonly existing in patient similarity calculation task with clinical data, to track which, some approaches have been proposed to use Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model the complex structural information in patient Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). These GNN based approaches usually treat medical concepts (i.e., symptoms, diseases) as nodes to learn spatial features and adopt Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn temporal sequence of these concepts. However, in many cases, several sequential concepts contained in EMR text are considered as occur simultaneously in the clinical diagnosis (i.e., some symptoms are detected simultaneously by once test), learning temporal sequence of these sequential concepts might cause noise for patient similarity calculation. Furthermore, the limited discriminative capability of concepts cannot provide sufficient indicative information for similarity learning. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-guided Event-relation Graph Learning Network (KEGLN) for patient similarity calculation. Specifically, after event extraction, we first construct element-relation graphs and use the first Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer to aggregate features from each event and its involved elements for reducing the noise produced by temporal sequence of concepts. Meanwhile, the entity description and attribute-value structure are extracted to supplement background knowledge of elements (concepts and trigger words). For the updated event nodes, we then design a event-relation graph and adopt the second GCN and GAT layer to aggregate information from events and their directly neighbors to extract spatial features of events at the current moment. Finally, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model is adopted to learn temporal dependency of event nodes to capture the dynamic change of disease progress. Through diverse datasets and extensive experiments, our KEGLN model outperform...",

        "abstract": "In the complex landscape of the Internet, interdomain routing systems are essential for ensuring seamless connectivity and reachability across autonomous systems. However, the lack of dependable security validation mechanisms in these systems poses persistent challenges. Vulnerabilities such as prefix hijacking, path forgery, and route leakage not only compromise network operators and users, but also threaten the stability and accessibility of the Internet's core infrastructure. To address this, visualization and visual analytics techniques are adept at identifying and detecting security threats, offering network administrators effective methods to monitor and maintain network operations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research in visualization and visual analytics for inter-domain routing security. We delineate four scenarios for tasks analysis in network visualization: monitoring, detection, verification, and discovery. Each category is explored in detail, focusing on the employed data sources and visualization techniques. Several key findings are presented at the end of each category, aimed at providing researchers and practitioners with research inspiration. Furthermore, we examine the trends of academic interest observed in recent decades and propose potential directions for future research in visual analytics pertaining to Internet infrastructure security.",

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) employ hardware-based isolation mechanisms to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive code and data. One such prevalent implementation is Arm TrustZone, which partitions the system into the secure and normal (non-secure) worlds. However, this partitioning results in the secure world having very limited visibility into the operating information of the normal world, creating a semantic gap between these two worlds. Specifically, the secure world lacks an effective user identity authentication when receiving data requests from the normal world. Consequently, malicious Client Applications (CAs) in the normal world can deceive Trusted Applications (TAs) in the secure world by utilizing elaborate request parameters, compromising the sensitive data stored by other CAs. We systematically classify these Semantic Gap Vulnerabilities (SGVs) and propose a mate system for the TEE called MaTEE to defend against SGVs. MaTEE utilizes Arm Pointer Authentication (PA) to bind each request to the corresponding CA's identity and then verifies the identity when the CA accesses sensitive data, thereby preventing malicious request forgery. In particular, MaTEE isolates sensitive data of different CAs without modifying existing CAs and TAs. Our evaluation demonstrates that MaTEE successfully defends against SGVs with a minimal runtime overhead (2.19%).",

        "abstract": "With the wide application of graphs in various fields, graph query languages have attracted more and more attention. Existing graph query languages, such as GraphQL and SoQL, mostly have similar expressive power as the first-order logic or its extended versions, and are limited when used to express various queries. In this paper, since the graph data model is the base of the graph query language, we propose a new graph data model with the expressive power of monadic second-order logic (abbr. MSOL), and then present a more expressive SQL- like declarative graph query language named $SOGQL$ to support more common queries efficiently. Specifically, a new graph calculus is firstly proposed based on MSOL for attributed graphs. Then, the new graph data model is proposed. Its graph algebra, which operates on graph sets, has seven fundamental operators such as union, filter, map, and reduce. Next, the graph query language $SOGQL$ is proposed based on the graph data model. Since the graph algebra has the same expressive power as the graph calculus, $SOGQL$ has the expressive power of MSOL, and can express queries with constraints on subgraphs. Moreover, applied with $SOGQL$ , a prototype system named $SOGDB$ is implemented. $SOGDB$ is applied with $SOGQL$ , and the experimental results show its efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) face considerable challenges when interacting with their environment, especially during lane changes. Enhancing decision-making and planning processes with prediction regarding the intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles can significantly improve lane change performance. However, prediction accuracy is limited by both the technology used and environmental variability. Utilizing low-confidence predictive data can adversely impact the safety and comfort of AV operations. This paper proposes a novel dual-model framework for lane change decision-making and planning of AVs (LC-Dual), which dialectically uses predictive data and provides redundant safety measures in parallel. In Model I, the optimal end-state trajectory for lane changes is planned using predictive information from the upper layer. In Model II, a redundant lane change trajectory is quickly generated based on a spatio-temporal safety corridor constructed from real perception data. Ultimately, the selection of the lane change model and trajectory is determined by rule-based decision-making, factoring in prediction confidence and computational efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the LC-Dual framework yields more adaptive trajectories in scenarios with accurate predictions and effective switches between lane change models in cases of inaccurate predictions. The LC-Dual framework markedly improves safety and efficiency in lane change operations, thereby facilitating broader AV adoption.",

        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has been widely applied in big data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) for excellent learning ability, while the black-box nature of DNN leads to uncertainty of inference results. With higher interpretability, Convolutional Fuzzy Neural Network (CFNN) becomes an alternative choice for the model of IoT applications. IoT applications are often latency-sensitive. By jointly utilizing computing power of IoT devices and edge servers, end-edge collaborative CFNN inference improves the insufficiency of local computing resources and reduces the latency of computing-intensive CFNN inference. However, the calculation amount of fuzzy layers is hard to get directly, bringing difficulty to CFNN partition. Additionally, the profit of service providers is often ignored in existing work on distributed inference. In this paper, an end-edge collaborative inference framework of CFNNs for big data-driven IoT, named DisCFNN, is proposed. Specifically, a novel CFNN structure and a method of fuzzy layer calculation amount assessment are designed at first. Next, computing resource allocation and CFNN partition decisions are generated on each edge server based on deep reinforcement learning. Then, each IoT device sends the request of CFNN inference service to a certain edge server or infer the whole CFNN locally according to the task offloading strategy obtained through many-to-one matching game. Finally, the effectiveness of DisCFNN is evaluated through extensive experiments.",

        "abstract": "To improve the uncertainty quantification of variance networks, we propose a novel tree-structured local neural network model that partitions the feature space into multiple regions based on uncertainty heterogeneity. A tree is built upon giving the training data, whose leaf nodes represent different regions where region-specific neural networks are trained to predict both the mean and the variance for quantifying uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty-splitting neural regression tree (USNRT) employs novel splitting criteria. At each node, a neural network is trained on the full data first, and a statistical test for the residuals is conducted to find the best split, corresponding to the two subregions with the most significant uncertainty heterogeneity between them. USNRT is computationally friendly, because very few leaf nodes are sufficient and pruning is unnecessary. Furthermore, an ensemble version can be easily constructed to estimate the total uncertainty, including the aleatory and epistemic. On extensive UCI datasets, USNRT or its ensemble shows superior performance compared to some recent popular methods for quantifying uncertainty with variances. Through comprehensive visualization and analysis, we uncover how USNRT works and show its merits, revealing that uncertainty heterogeneity does exist in many datasets and can be learned by USNRT.",

        "abstract": "As the adage âmany hands make light workâ suggests, collaborative influence often surpasses individual influence. Inspired by this insight, we undertook a study on group influence maximization in evolving social networks, which is applicable to domains such as social media marketing and financial risk management. Our goal is to reveal how collaborative influence propagates in dynamic settings. Existing research concentrates predominantly on static networks and overlooks the dynamics of evolving social structures. Recognizing the limitations of current influence propagation models for our specific issue, we introduce an innovative model rooted in user behaviors. It considers temporal aspects, and we also suggest a methodology for assessing influence propagation probabilities based on both user behaviors and duration. We introduce an algorithm for extracting user groups using community search, improving efficiency through supergraph construction. Additionally, we present an influence maximization algorithm based on group dynamics with a 3-degree propagation framework. Recognizing diminishing influence, a 3-degree truncation strategy effectively enhances the group influence propagation efficiency. This approach efficiently captures the influence spread and accelerates convergence, boosting the search efficiency. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets. The results distinctly highlight the superiority of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Entity alignment is the most critical technology of knowledge fusion, which aims to identify and align entities that exist in different knowledge graphs (KGs) but represent the same real-world objects. Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend static triples into quadruples by introducing temporal information, which is more in line with the dynamic changes of the real world and is often used to enhance the performance of various applications. However, the existing entity alignment methods mainly focus on traditional KGs, ignoring the temporal information contained in TKGs may lead to misalignment between some similar entities. The latest method enhances the performance of entity alignment by learning temporal information embedding, but it does not make full use of the advantages of temporal information. In this paper, we propose a new Entity Alignment method for Cross-lingual TKG with BERT (EACTB). EACTB uses the BERT model of multi-language training to learn the semantic relevance of entity description. For temporal information, we propose a new and more efficient method to calculate the similarity of temporal information. EACTB uses graph convolution network (GCN) to embed structural information. In addition, iterative method is used to deal with the problem of insufficient training datasets. Experimental results on three cross-lingual TKGs datasets show that EACTB is significantly superior to existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Financial transaction systems have become the critical backbone of modern society, and the sharp increase in fraudulent transactions has become an unavoidable significant topic. Their presence poses a severe threat to financial markets, impacting the health of the economic and social welfare systems of various countries. However, most existing fraud detection methods are limited to detecting individual fraudulent entities within static transaction networks, which are neither suitable for continuously changing dynamic transaction networks nor capable of detecting the increasingly prevalent organized fraud crimes. This paper introduces a novel approach, Parallel Graph Learning with Temporal Stamp Encoding (PGLTSE). On the one hand, it designs a history information module to perform temporal dimension feature learning to adapt to the continuous changes in transaction information in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDG). On the other hand, it designs a gang-aware risk propagation algorithm to infer the risk of organized fraudulent activities in the global transaction relation graph. By simultaneously conducting parallel graph representation learning in both homogeneous global transaction relation graphs and heterogeneous local entity interaction graphs, it aggregates local interaction and global association information for end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of PGLTSE over existing methods, demonstrating its practical efficacy in detecting complex and evolving fraudulent behaviors in financial networks.",

        "abstract": "In the context of geo-social networks, the objective of Point-of-Interest (POI) group recommendation is to propose POIs that align with the preferences of all members within a specific temporal group. POI group recommendation is significant in enhancing user experience, promoting social interaction, and providing convenient access to information. It also aids in community building and business promotion in real-life scenarios. However, existing studies fail to capture user preferences accurately and reach consensus with respect to preferences for POIs, which leads to the recommendation of POIs with low accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose a Point-of-Interest (POI) group recommendation model, named PGR-PM , leveraging user preference embedding. Specifically, we first propose a strategy for representing user preferences dynamically by means of POI embedding. Subsequently, we propose a hybrid weight fusion strategy that utilizes an attention mechanism to aggregate the preferences of members within a temporal group. Furthermore, we design a three-layer perceptron structure to recommend POIs for the group. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments across four extensively employed real-world datasets, with the findings affirming the efficacy of our proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as one of the most promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. They are bioactive peptides featuring broad-spectrum activity and low drug-resistance. The discovery of ACPs via traditional biochemical methods is laborious and costly. Accordingly, various computational methods have been developed to facilitate the discovery of ACPs. However, the data resources and knowledge of ACPs are still very scarce, and only a few of them are clinically verified, which limits the competence of computational methods. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an ACP prediction model based on multi-domain transfer learning, namely MDTL-ACP, to discriminate novel ACPs from plentiful inactive peptides. In particular, we collect abundant antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from four well-studied peptide domains and extract their inherent features as the input of MDTL-ACP. The features learned from multiple source domains of AMPs are then transferred into the target prediction task of ACPs via artificial neural network-based shared-extractor and task-specific classifiers in MDTL-ACP. The knowledge captured in the transferred features enhances the prediction of ACPs in the target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that MDTL-ACP can outperform the traditional and state-of-the-art ACP prediction methods. The source code of MDTL-ACP and the data used in this study are available at https://github.com/JunhangCao/MTL-ACP .",

        "abstract": "Image classification models including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT) commonly employ a fully connected (FC) layer as the classifier. However, the fully connected nature of FC brings large amounts of weight parameters, limits the efficiency of inference, tends to over-fit the training data, and struggles to learn distinct class weights. To solve these problems, we propose a discrete representation classifier (DRC), a generic parameter-free classifier that offers efficiency, robustness, and more discriminative categorization. Specifically, the DRC discards numerous unimportant features and focuses solely on the salient features which are reinforced during training and presented in short discrete form during inference. Unlike the way of learning pseudo-prototypes (weights) from data laden with complex patterns and noises in FC, the DRC introducing discriminative fixed-prototypes which are almost uniformly distributed across the high-dimensional feature space, thus helps the model to learn more distinct boundaries between categories. Further leveraging the advantage of DRCâs focus on salient features, we propose Salient-CAM, which is able to locate the most important region in image without the need for weighting feature maps. The experiments demonstrate that simply replacing the modelâs classifier from FC to DRC can lead to a significant acceleration in the whole modelâs inference and a more robust classification. Additionally, the proposed Salient-CAM exhibits excellent object localization ability in complex natural scenes.",

        "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter influencing earth-atmosphere interactions and energy balance processes. The Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) was recently launched to support the realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which provides worldwide three-spectrum wide-swath, high-resolution and high-sensitivity thermal infrared (TIR) images. The objective of this study is to develop a modified three-channel split-window algorithm incorporating atmospheric water vapor content (W-TCSW) for LST retrieval from SDGSAT-1 images. This algorithm was developed from the existing split-window form. The parameters of the algorithm were determined based on the MODTRAN simulation results of 946 TIGR atmospheric profiles. The W-TCSW algorithm was comprehensively compared with the Split-Window (SW) and Three-Channel Split-Window (TCSW) algorithms. The retrieval results of the three algorithms were validated with simulated datasets and in-situ measurements from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) sites in China and the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites in the United States of America (USA). The SDGSAT-1 data retrieved by the W-TCSW algorithm was also inter-compared with Landsat and ECOSTRESS LST products. The W-TCSW algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy among the three retrieval algorithms (SW, TCSW and W-TCSW). The influences of atmospheric water vapor content (AWVC) and land surface emissivity (LSE) as well as land use and land cover (LULC) on retrieval algorithms were discussed in a long-term time series. This study introduces a novel LST retrieval algorithm considering AWVC for SDGSAT-1 images and elucidates comprehensive validation and comparative assessment, expanding the application of high spatial resolution TIR remote sensing data.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the use of container cloud platforms has experienced rapid growth. However, because containers are operating-system-level virtualization, their isolation is far less than that of virtual machines, posing considerable challenges for multi-tenant container cloud platforms. To address the issues associated with current container anomaly detection algorithms, such as the difficulty in mining periodic features and the high rate of false positives due to noisy data, we propose an anomaly detection method named SST-LOF, based on singular spectrum transformation and the local outlier factor. Our method enhances the traditional Singular Spectrum Transformation (SST) algorithm to meet the needs of streaming unsupervised detection. Furthermore, our method improves the calculation mode of the anomaly score of the Local Outlier Factor algorithm (LOF) and reduces false positives of noisy data with dynamic sliding windows. Additionally, we have designed and implemented a container cloud anomaly detection system that can perform real-time, unsupervised, streaming anomaly detection on containers quickly and accurately. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in detecting anomalies in containers in both simulated and real cloud environments.",

        "abstract": "Solid State Drives (SSDs) were initially developed as faster storage devices intended to replace conventional magnetic Hard Disk Drives (HDDs). However, high computational capabilities enable SSDs to be computing nodes, not just faster storage devices. Such capability is generally called âIn-Storage Computing (ISC)â. Todayâs Hadoop MapReduce framework has become a de facto standard for big data processing. This paper explores In-Storage Computing challenges and opportunities for the Hadoop MapReduce framework. For this, we integrate a Hadoop MapReduce system with ISC SSD devices that implement the Hadoop Mapper inside real SSD firmware. This offloads Map tasks from the host MapReduce system to the ISC SSDs. We additionally optimize the host Hadoop system to make the best use of our proposed ISC Hadoop system. Experimental results demonstrate our ISC Hadoop MapReduce system achieves a remarkable performance gain (2.3 faster) as well as significant energy savings (11.5 lower) compared to a typical Hadoop MapReduce system. Further, the experiment suggests such ISC augmented systems can provide a very promising computing model in terms of a system scalability.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the Graph Transformer has demonstrated superiority on various graph-level tasks by facilitating global interactions among nodes. However, as for node-level tasks, the existing Graph Transformer cannot perform as well as expected. Actually, a node in a real-world graph does not necessarily have relationships with every other node, and this global interaction weakens node features. This raises a fundamental question: should we partition out an appropriate interaction channel based on graph structure so that noisy and irrelevant information will be filtered and every node can aggregate information in the optimal channel? We first perform a series of experiments on manually created graphs with varying homophily ratios. Surprisingly, we observe that different graph structures indeed require distinct optimal interaction channels. This leads us to ask whether we can develop a partitioning rule that ensures each node interacts with relevant and valuable targets. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Graph Transformer named Multi-channel Graphormer. The model is evaluated on six network datasets with different homophily ratios for the node classification task. Moreover, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets for the recommendation task. Experimental results show that the Multi-channel Graphormer surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating superior performance.",

        "abstract": "The metaverse offers an unprecedented immersive experience and a fresh connection paradigm for consumers, which brings security threats related to unauthorized data access, potential misuse, and increasing attacks in the bilateral information flow. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an efficient and secure access control scheme. However, current efforts struggle to address these more complicated security issues. To do this, in this paper, we present an expressive access control encryption (EACE) scheme for bilateral control of information flow in metaverse-enabled consumer electronics. Our EACE supports fine-grained and bilateral control of senders and receivers by carefully taking advantage of access control encryption, dual-policy attribute-based encryption, and matchmaking encryption. Furthermore, we propose a novel sanitization algorithm with sender anonymity and bilateral policy privacy against the malicious sanitizer. We formalize the corresponding security definitions and give rigorous proofs. Performance analysis demonstrates that our EACE can simultaneously achieve bilateral control with policy privacy, sender anonymity against sanitizer, and lightweight decryption. The experimental results show that our proposal costs less computational and storage overhead in the symmetric bilinear group. The impressive performance indicates that our EACE is an excellent choice to balance security and efficiency when consumer electronics meet the metaverse.",

        "abstract": "Downsampling is a crucial task for processing large scale and/or dense point clouds with limited resources. Owing to the development of deep learning, approaches of task-oriented point cloud downsampling have significant performance gains in preserving geometric information. However, most downsamling methods are limited by the disordered and unstructured point cloud data, making it difficult to continually improve the performance. To address this issue, we propose a light-weight Transformer network (LighTN) for the task-oriented point cloud downsampling as an end-to-end solution. In LighTN, we design an energy-efficient and permutation invariant single-head self-correlation module to extract refined global geometric features. Moreover, we present a novel sampling loss function to guide LighTN to focus on critical point cloud regions with more uniform distributions and prominent point coverage. Extensive experiments on classification, registration, and reconstruction tasks demonstrate that LighTN can achieve the state-of-the-art performance-overhead tradeoff and high-quality qualitative results.",

        "abstract": "Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of noncoding RNA that is highly conserved and exhibit exceptional stability. Due to its function as a microRNA sponge, circRNA has gained significant attention as an essential biomarker and potential drug target in the pathogenesis of several cancers. Although many circRNAs have been identified to play a role in cancer resistance, traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive. In this context, computational methods offer a promising way to facilitate the discovery process. However, most existing prediction models focus on the association between circRNAs and drug resistance, without considering the corresponding disease-related information in the circRNA-drug resistance association. Incorporating disease-related information into the prediction of circRNA-drug resistance associations could potentially improve the efficiency and speed of discovering and developing circRNA-targeting drugs. We propose a computational framework, named GraphCDD, for predicting the association between circRNA and drug resistance. Our model utilizes data from three sources, namely circRNA, disease, and drug, to construct three similarity networks that represent the features of circRNA, disease, and drug, respectively. We utilize a multimodal graph neural network to acquire efficient representations of circRNAs, diseases, and drugs by integrating various types of information, and establish a predictive model. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our model and provided a promising method in predicting potential associations between circRNA and drug resistance. The source code and dataset of GraphCDD can be found at https://github.com/Ziqiang-Liu/GraphCDD .",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been proven beneficial for mitigating the issue of limited labeled data, especially on volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike previous SSL methods which focus on exploring highly confident pseudo-labels or developing consistency regularization schemes, our empirical findings suggest that differential decoder features emerge naturally when two decoders strive to generate consistent predictions. Based on the observation, we first analyze the treasure of discrepancy in learning towards consistency, under both pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization settings, and subsequently propose a novel SSL method called LeFeD, which learns the feature-level discrepancies obtained from two decoders, by feeding such information as feedback signals to the encoder. The core design of LeFeD is to enlarge the discrepancies by training differential decoders, and then learn from the differential features iteratively. We evaluate LeFeD against eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public datasets. Experiments show LeFeD surpasses competitors without any bells and whistles, such as uncertainty estimation and strong constraints, as well as setting a new state of the art for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Code has been released at https://github.com/maxwell0027/LeFeD.",

        "abstract": "Driving is a complex and personalized endeavor that entails the brain processing sensory information amidst continuously changing situations. Here, we sought to explore the potential of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based decision-making approach for predicting personalized driving behavior. Driving behavior data and EEG signals were collected simultaneously from 133 participants. Our analysis revealed that the time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) serves as an effective driving-related EEG (DR-EEG) feature capable of describing the correlation between brain regions irrespective of their physical proximity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that incorporating situational embeddings yielded a significant improvement in predictive performance of 27.28%. Notably, our results highlighted the impact of individualized differences in brain cognition and situational perception, which enable individual models to outperform general models, with an average of R2 = 0.982. We found that the activation of neural connections associated with the frontal and left temporal lobes appears to be of paramount importance in driving decision-making. These findings suggest that integrating individual brain and situational knowledge into the computational decision-making framework of driving holds immense promise for deploying driving-related brain-computer interactions (BCIs) and developing personalized intelligent driving systems.",

        "abstract": "Encoding only the task-related information from the raw data, i.e ., disentangled representation learning, can greatly contribute to the robustness and generalizability of models. Although significant advances have been made by regularizing the information in representations with information theory, two major challenges remain: 1) the representation compression inevitably leads to performance drop; 2) the disentanglement constraints on representations are in complicated optimization. To these issues, we introduce Bayesian networks with transmitted information to formulate the interaction among input and representations during disentanglement. Building upon this framework, we propose DisTIB (Transmitted Information Bottleneck for Disentangled representation learning), a novel objective that navigates the balance between information compression and preservation. We employ variational inference to derive a tractable estimation for DisTIB. This estimation can be simply optimized via standard gradient descent with a reparameterization trick. Moreover, we theoretically prove that DisTIB can achieve optimal disentanglement, underscoring its superior efficacy. To solidify our claims, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks to demonstrate the appealing efficacy of DisTIB and validate our theoretical analyses.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of positioning technology produces an extremely large volume of spatio-temporal data with various geometry types such as point, line string, polygon, or a mixed combination of them. As one of the most fundamental but time-consuming operations, $k$ nearest neighbors join ( $k$ NN join) has attracted much attention. However, most existing works for $k$ NN join either ignore temporal information or consider only point data. Besides, most of them do not automatically adapt to the different features of spatio-temporal data. This paper proposes to address a novel and useful problem, i.e., ST- $k$ NN join, which considers both spatial closeness and temporal concurrency . To support ST- $k$ NN join over a large amount of spatio-temporal data with any geometry types efficiently, we propose a novel distributed solution based on Apache Spark. Specifically, our method adopts a two-round join framework. In the first round join, we propose a new spatio-temporal partitioning method that achieves spatio-temporal locality and load balance at the same time. We also propose a lightweight index structure, i.e., Time Range Count Index (TRC-index), to enable efficient ST- $k$ NN join. In the second round join, to reduce the data transmission among different machines, we remove duplicates based on spatio-temporal reference points before shuffling local results. Furthermore, we design a set of models based on Bayesian optimization to automatically determine the values for the introduced parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted using three real big datasets, showing that our method is much more scalable and achieves 9X faster than baselines, and that the proposed models can always predict appropriate parameters for different datasets.

        "abstract": "As an increasing number of data-driven deep learning models are deployed in our daily lives, the issue of algorithmic fairness has become a major concern. These models are trained on data that inevitably contains various biases, leading them to learn unfair representations that differ across demographic subgroups, resulting in unfair predictions. Previous work on fairness has attempted to remove subgroup information from learned features, aiming to contribute to similar representations across subgroups and lead to fairer predictions. However, identifying and removing this information is extremely challenging due to the âblack boxâ nature of neural networks. Moreover, removing desired features without affecting other features is difficult, as features are often correlated, potentially harming model prediction performance. This paper aims to learn fair representations without degrading model prediction performance. We adopt knowledge distillation, allowing unfair models to learn fair representations directly from a fair teacher. The proposed method provides a novel approach to obtaining fair representations while maintaining valid prediction performance. We evaluate the proposed method, FairDistill, on four datasets (CIFAR-10, UTKFace, CelebA, and Adult) under diverse settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Maritime communication, critical for global oceanic trade, faces challenges and opportunities with advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Traditional methods are susceptible to interception due to open channels, limited authentication, jamming, and other security risks. Securing vessel movements and locations in Internet of Vessels (IoV) is essential to prevent unauthorized data interception and tampering during transmission. We propose a ship authentication method using location-based secure keys to ensure the confidentiality of a vesselâs whereabouts. The proposed schemeâs robustness is validated through formal and informal security analyses, and formal verification using the Scyther automated verification tool, demonstrating its effectiveness against potential attacks in maritime networks. Comparative studies indicate that utilizing location-based keys maintains anonymity and untraceability without imposing significant computational or communication burdens. Experimental findings from comprehensive big data analytics and simulations using NS3 validate the schemeâs feasibility and performance.",

        "abstract": "The role of Big-data is imperative in Blockchain-based trading systems, cloud-based applications, P2P-based applications, and parallel communications. It is very important to fuse the data obtained from heterogeneous Blockchain nodes in such a way that it can provide some useful information after processing. The analysis of the data must be made without losing the useful chunks of the information especially when it involves financial transactions. By combining the data from multiple sources in a Blockchain environment, the accuracy and completeness of data can be assured. The reliability of data is also enhanced since the data can be validated easily with the cross-reference points. The integration of data allows comprehensive analysis of data and also helps in decision making. It also helps in detection of frauds by reducing the dimensionality of data. In order to improve the interaction in the data, and to enhance the data transmission rate, a new soft computing based data fusion control model has been proposed in this article for the fusion of data in Blockchain databases that supports communications over 6G channels. The proposed model comprises hardware and software components along with soft computing based smart data fusion mechanism. The proposed soft computing-based mechanism behaves smartly to process the volume of data by training the system implicitly. The fuzzy logic-based similarity matrix is also devised by calculating the similarity in the data instances to make the system more adaptive. The fusion of a Big-data in the Blockchain systems is performed on the basis of the proposed model for controlling the data interactions. The empirical results show that the proposed data fusion control model for Big-data in the Blockchain system is reliable, secure, and has lower response time. The packet loss rate is low and data transmission is high which proves the viability and robustness of the proposed fusion model for Blockchain enabled applications.",

        "abstract": "Learning hash functions for approximate nearest neighbor search of high-dimensional data has received a surge of interests in recent years. Most existing methods are often concerned with learning hash functions for nearest neighbor search on high-dimensional data from a single source. In many real-world applications, data can be collected from diverse sources or represented using different feature descriptors. This raises an open challenge, i.e., the Cross-View Nearest Neighbor Search (CVNNS), where the representation of a query instance can be different from that of target instances to be retrieved in database. The key challenge of cross-view search is to learn an effective shared representation which can effectively connect the query instance and the target instances to be retrieved. In this paper, we present a new cross-view nearest neighbor search scheme by applying the emerging deep learning to hash techniques. In particular, we investigate two different architectures of deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for learning to hash toward cross-view nearest neighbor search, and conduct extensive experiments to examine their empirical performance on diverse settings of cross-view image retrieval tasks. The encouraging results show that our technique outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Data silos create barriers to accessing and utilizing data dispersed over networks. Directly sharing data easily suffers from the long downloading time, the single point failure and the untraceable data usage. In this paper, we present Minerva, a peer-to-peer cross-cluster data query system based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Minerva makes use of the distributed Hash table (DHT) lookup to pinpoint the locations that store content chunks. We theoretically model the DHT query delay and introduce a fat Merkle tree structure as well as the DHT caching to reduce it. We design the query plan for read and write operations on top of Apache Drill that enables the collaborative query with decentralized workers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Minerva, and the results show that Minerva achieves up to $2.08 \times$ query performance acceleration compared to the original IPFS data query, and can complete data analysis queries on the Internet-like environments within an average latency of 0.615 second. With a collaborative query, Minerva could perform up to $1.39 \times$ performance acceleration than the centralized query with raw data shipment.",

        "abstract": "High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are frequently encountered in big date-related applications for describing restricted observed interactions among large node sets. How to perform accurate and efficient representation learning on such HDI data is a hot yet thorny issue. A latent factor (LF) model has proven to be efficient in addressing it. However, the objective function of an LF model is nonconvex. Commonly adopted first-order methods cannot approach its second-order stationary point, thereby resulting in accuracy loss. On the other hand, traditional second-order methods are impractical for LF models since they suffer from high computational costs due to the required operations on the objectiveâs huge Hessian matrix. In order to address this issue, this study proposes a generalized Nesterov-accelerated second-order LF (GNSLF) model that integrates twofold conceptions: 1) acquiring proper second-order step efficiently by adopting a Hessian-vector algorithm and 2) embedding the second-order step into a generalized Nesterovâs acceleration (GNA) method for speeding up its linear search process. The analysis focuses on the local convergence for GNSLFâs nonconvex cost function instead of the global convergence has been taken; its local convergence properties have been provided with theoretical proofs. Experimental results on six HDI data cases demonstrate that GNSLF performs better than state-of-the-art LF models in accuracy for missing data estimation with high efficiency, i.e., a second-order model can be accelerated by incorporating GNA without accuracy loss.",

        "abstract": "RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has gained tremendous attention in recent years. In particular, transformer has been employed and shown great potential. However, existing transformer models usually overlook the vital edge information, which is a major issue restricting the further improvement of SOD accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel edge-aware RGB-D SOD transformer, called, which explicitly models the edge information in a dual-band decomposition framework. Specifically, we employ two parallel decoder networks to learn the high-frequency edge and low-frequency body features from the low-and high-level features extracted from a two-steam multimodal backbone network, respectively. Next, we propose a cross-attention complementarity exploration module to enrich the edge/body features by exploiting the multimodal complementarity information. The refined features are then fed into our proposed color-hint guided fusion module for enhancing the depth feature and fusing the multimodal features. Finally, the resulting features are fused using our deeply supervised progressive fusion module, which progressively integrates edge and body features for predicting saliency maps. Our model explicitly considers the edge information for accurate RGB-D SOD, overcoming the limitations of existing methods and effectively improving the performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that is an effective RGB-D SOD framework that outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. A further extension to RGB-T SOD demonstrates the promising potential of our model in various kinds of multimodal SOD tasks.",

        "abstract": "Coding metasurfaces (MSs) provide an effective strategy for designing highly integrated devices due to their powerful ability to flexibly manipulate the wavefront of electromagnetic (EM) waves. To date, it remains a great challenge to theoretically construct and experimentally verify highly integrated MSs for manipulating both linear polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP) waves in full-space at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) bands. In this work, a highly-integrated, low-crosstalk, six-channel coding meta-atom is developed using hybrid phase manipulations, which can achieve independent full-space phase controls for three LP channels and three CP channels across three mmWave and sub-THz bands. To validate the concept, we designed and fabricated a compact coding MS, including refracted four-beam splitting for LP wave at 65 GHz; radar cross section (RCS) reduction, anomalous reflection and dual-vortex beam generation for LP and CP waves at 0.12 THz; two-beam splitting for two decoupled CP waves at 0.154 THz. All the theoretical, simulated, and experimental results agree well with each other. The developed highly integrated MS with multiple independent channels presents a promising candidate for future advanced 5G and 6G systems.",

        "abstract": "The visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) method aims to utilize the complementary information between these two modalities to synthesize a new image containing richer information. Although it has been extensively studied, the synthesized image that has the best visual results is difficult to reach consensus since users have different opinions. To address this problem, we propose an adjustable VIF framework termed AdjFusion, which introduces a global controlling coefficient into VIF to enforce it can interact with users. Within AdjFusion, a semantic-aware modulation module is proposed to transform the global controlling coefficient into a semantic-aware controlling coefficient, which provides pixel-wise guidance for AdjFusion considering both interactivity and semantic information within visible and infrared images. In addition, the introduced global controlling coefficient not only can be utilized as an external interface for interaction with users but also can be easily customized by the downstream tasks ( e.g ., VIF-based detection and segmentation), which can help to select the best fusion result for the downstream tasks. Taking advantage of this, we further propose a lightweight adaptation module for AdjFusion to learn the global controlling coefficient to be suitable for the downstream tasks better. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed AdjFusion can 1) provide ways to dynamically synthesize images to meet the diverse demands of users; and 2) outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods on both VIF-based detection and segmentation tasks, with the constructed lightweight adaptation method.

        "abstract": "Deploying the convolutional neural network (CNN) model on Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide diverse recognition services has received increasing attention. Due to the limited storage, computing, and other resources of IoT devices, it has become mainstream to first train the CNN model on the edge/cloud server and then send the trained CNN to the IoT device. However, most existing related methods suffer from two limitations, (i) low performance due to service interference or insufficient mutual assistance, and (ii) large memory resources and switching resource overhead. To this end, this paper proposes a resource-efficient multiple recognition services framework for IoT devices. The proposed framework is based on the edge server-assisted IoT device training of the CNN model, and the framework includes a deeper weight adaptation (DeepWAdapt) algorithm to mitigate service interference. The DeepWAdapt algorithm consists of a set of learnable masks, and by inserting these masks into the appropriate layers of the CNN model, it mitigates mutual interference between services caused by training a single CNN model for multiple services. Each service has a specific set of masks. These learnable masks work like keys for each service, selecting appropriate and specific features for each service from a shared feature set. Experimental results demonstrate that the DeepWAdapt outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on image-level classification services and pixel-level dense prediction services. Specifically, when executing 40 services based on ResNet18, the proposed DeepWAdapt achieves 66.82% F1-score on the CelebA dataset, which is +2.61% F1-score than the previous state-of-the-art result. In addition, compared with the routing method, our proposed DeepWAdapt also reduces network transmission traffic by approximately 35%.",

However, subtle artifacts might be eliminated by compression, and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based detectors are invalidated for fake face images with compression. In this work, we propose a two-stream network for deepfake detection. We observed that high-frequency noise features and spatial features are inherently complementary to each other. Thus, both spatial features and high-frequency noise features are exploited for face forgery detection. Specifically, we design a Double-Frequency Transformer Module (DFTM) to guide the learning of spatial features from local artifact regions. To effectively fuse spatial features and high-frequency noise features, a Dual Domain Attention Fusion Module (DDAFM) is designed. We also introduce a local relationship constraint loss, which requires only image-level labels, for model training. We evaluate the proposed...",

        "abstract": "Current supercomputers use an SSD-based storage layer called Burst Buffer (BB) to provide I/O-intensive applications with accelerated storage access. However, efficiently utilizing this limited and expensive storage remains a critical issue, creating an urgent need for implementing Quality of Service (QoS) in BB. To address this, we propose RuYi, a QoS-aware method to provide applications with bandwidth guarantees in the BB file system. RuYi tackles two main issues. First, it quantitatively profiles available bandwidth resources in BB to ensure reliable QoS, a crucial aspect seldom studied in the literature. Second, RuYi offers fine-grained process-level QoS via an innovative process-to-BB mapping, maximizing resource utilizationâsomething not achievable with conventional coarse-grained compute-to-BB mapping. We evaluated RuYi on a subsystem of the leading exascale supercomputer Sunway, consisting of 4,000 compute nodes and 200 BB nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that RuYi achieves an impressive end-to-end bandwidth control accuracy of 97%, while improving BB utilization by up to 116% compared to conventional coarse-grained compute-to-BB mapping.",

        "abstract": "Sixth generation (6G) networks deploy unmanned aerial vehicles and mobile edge computing to provide collaborative computing and reliable connectivity for resource-limited mobile devices (MDs). However, due to the untrusted and broadcast nature of wireless transmission among communicating MDs and computing resource providers, ensuring the security of resource transactions will be challenging. Blockchain-based resource-sharing systems have been proposed to address security issues. However, these systems use existing consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work that consume massive amounts of system resources. In addressing this, some studies attempted to use single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in leader selection. Nevertheless, these solutions overlooked the intelligence and flexibility of blockchain configuration, and a single-point of failure can cause the system to fail. We propose a multi-agent Distributed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MAD3PG)-assisted consensus mechanism for blockchain-based collaborative resource-sharing to address these issues. First, we propose a stochastic game-based incentive-mechanism to encourage consensus nodes to participate in transaction validation. Then, we formulate the optimization problem of node selection and blockchain configuration as a Markov decision process and solve it with the MAD3PG algorithm. With MAD3PG, the agents select consensus nodes based on their experience and available resources and dynamically adjust blockchain settings. The simulation results show that MAD3PG outperforms the benchmarks in maximizing throughput and incentive while minimizing block production latency.",

        "abstract": "Single-ended clamped microcantilever biosensors and qual-ended clamped with serpentine cantilevers microcantilever biosensors were developed and batch-fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical system technology for accurately measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) via a laser emitted by the confocal fiber displacement sensor. The aptamer was immobilized on the gold surface of the sensing cantilever so that interactions between the aptamer and PSA successfully generated a stress change of the microcantilever biosensors, resulting in a bending conformation. The reference cantilever without gold eliminates interference from the environment by detecting deflection induced by nonspecific interactions. The profile of microcantilevers could be monitored by a spectral confocal three-dimensional (3D) morphological scanning and imaging system. The two microcantilever deflections had a good linearity within 50 to 2000 ng/mL. The detection limits of the two microcantilever are 9.88 ng/mL and 7.08 ng/mL, respectively. These microcantilever biosensors provide a promising approach to detect PSA in early prostate cancer diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of edge computing, devices now offer powerful computing capabilities and diverse applications. However, the surge in smart devices accessing the Internet overwhelms edge servers, which have limited and unevenly distributed resources. This results in challenges like energy management, load balancing, real-time performance, and system complexity. Existing research fails to comprehensively consider these challengesâ combined impact, making it difficult to maximize performance when facing real complex scenarios. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an edge cloud resource scheduling scheme based on Evolutionary-Weighted Clustering and Transformer-Augmented Reinforcement Learning (EC-TRL). First, server nodes are deployed at the center of user clusters, based on user device locations, to optimize communication delay and evenly distribute resources. Second, the multi-objective scheduling optimization problem under delay constraints is converted into a Markov decision problem, and a deep reinforcement learning method based on soft actor-critic (SAC) is proposed. Finally, Actor Transformer (AT) and Critic Transformer (CT) are proposed to improve the network structure of SAC, capture long-term dependencies and complex patterns in long task scheduling sequences, and improve the modelâs adaptability and generalization performance in complex dynamic environments. Through comparison experiments with RR, Random, PPO, D3QN, SAC-L, and SAC-M, the results show that the proposed method improves the optimization performance of energy consumption, load balancing, and rejection rate of edge cloud resource scheduling by at least 9.57%, 10.90%, and 5.05%.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of electronic devices has contributed to an increase in poor posture, particularly when it comes to the cervical spine, leading to various cervical vertebral pain disorders. In this paper, we focus on accurately monitoring the motion status of the cervical spine using the accelerometers and gyroscope sensors embedded in earphones. Our aim is to gain a better understanding of cervical spine health. To address the individual differences among subjects, we introduce fuzzy rules to the Re-ISDA method, proposing a novel approach known as FuzRe-ISDA. Unlike traditional domain adaptation methods, the FuzRe-ISDA method offers flexibility in adjusting the contribution from different source domains. It takes into account the collective impact of multiple models on predicting new user behavior. Moreover, this method can quickly adapt to new users without requiring extensive datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our FuzRe-ISDA approach outperforms popular domain adaptation methods in terms of accuracy when predicting cervical motion. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in addressing individual differences and improving the reliability of cervical spine motion prediction.",

        "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a promising technique for next-generation mobile networks, offering reduced device size, power consumption, cost, and improved spectrum efficiency. Full realization of such benefits relies on waveform design and resource allocation. This paper focuses on frequency-time (FT) resource allocation of multi-user uplink ISAC systems by minimizing the CramÃ©r-Rao bound (CRB) of 5G new-radio signals. We first derive two types of CRBs for communications with respect to channel coefficients and parameters, respectively, and derive one CRB with respect to parameters for radar by removing the line-of-sight path and exploiting the shared parameters among different users' channels. Closed-form solutions to the FT resources are obtained under certain conditions for both radar and communication CRB minimizations, revealing the relationship and differences between the optimal radar and communication FT-resource allocations. Then, to balance the radar and communication CRB performance, we formulate two ISAC FT-resource optimization problems based on the two different communication CRBs and optimize FT resources accordingly. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CRB optimization scheme.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents ChestBox, a novel approach that utilizes state functions to facilitate low-latency state sharing for stateful serverless computing. When an application function needs to share a state, the state function creates a memory space with Linux's shared memory object to store the state. Other application functions can then read the state directly from the shared memory. ChestBox enables fast state sharing that avoids excessive memory overhead without compromising on-demand resource allocation compared to existing solutions. This effectively reduces the energy consumption of serverless computing and promotes sustainable computing. The implementation of ChestBox on Apache OpenWhisk unearths two major implementation challenges, which we address with respective optimization techniques, i.e., state function channel and state swapping. The evaluation of ChestBox with four real-world applications shows that compared with the state-of-the-art approach, it can reduce state-sharing latency by up to 99.71%, while reducing execution costs by 24.59% and storage costs by 99.76%.",

        "abstract": "Music recommendation systems aim to suggest tracks that users may enjoy. However, the accuracy of recommendation results is affected by popularity bias. Previous studies have focused on mitigating the direct effect of single-item popularity in video, news, or e-commerce recommendations, but have overlooked the multisource popularity biases in music recommendations. This article proposes a causal inference-based method to reduce the influence of both track and artist popularity. First, we construct a causal graph that encompasses users, tracks, and artists within the context of music recommendations. Next, we employ matrix factorization in conjunction with counterfactual inference theory to mitigate the popularity effects of artists and tracks, taking into account both the natural direct and indirect effects of these entities on music recommendations. Experimental results evaluated on four music recommendation datasets indicate that our method outperforms other baselines and effectively alleviates the popularity bias of both tracks and artists.",

Specifically, for NR V2X messages, the HARQ feedback and retransmission improve its success delivery probability but endanger its confidentiality. This paper proposes a secure scheme, namely SecHARQ, to maximize the security performance of HARQ-assisted NR V2X while satisfying the reliability requirement. To describe the performance of SecHARQ accurately, a stochastic geometric based theoretical framework is developed with the consideration of three specified factors, namely transmission rounds, resource allocation, and feedback option selection. With the help of this framework, we can formulate the SecHARQ scheme as a tractable optimization problem. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme is beneficial for secure communication in HARQ-assisted NR V2X by carefully tuning the optimal parameters of SecHARQ.",

        "abstract": "The extensive range of food safety standards poses a significant challenge to efficiently accessing specific information within this domain, necessitating innovative solutions to streamline the process. In response, researchers are focusing on constructing a knowledge graph based on food safety standards to facilitate efficient associative querying. Named entity recognition is a pivotal element in this endeavor due to its critical impact on the accuracy and quality of the knowledge graph. To address the nuanced challenges of accurately identifying nested entity boundaries and rectifying entity class imbalances in food safety standards, we present PGD-GP, a novel Chinese named entity recognition model. This model is based on Projected Gradient Descent for adversarial training and Global Pointer. The model innovatively refines the Chinese Bert model at the encoding layer, employing the adversarial training method PGD to iteratively introduce perturbations to character vectors, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness and adaptability to texts. The decoding layer leverages Global Pointer to accurately determine dependencies and relative positional relationships between characters, thus facilitating more precise recognition of entity boundaries. To combat the issue of class imbalance, Circle Loss is utilized as the loss function. We developed and annotated the Food Safety Standard Dataset using a specifically tailored ontology rule for food safety standards. Comparative experiments conducted on the Food Safety Standard Dataset and the public Resume dataset demonstrate that PGD-GP surpasses six mainstream baseline models in performance, thereby validating the effectiveness and robustness of PGD-GP. Building upon the foundation of PGD-GP and the Food Safety Standard Dataset, we implemented a prototype system that integrates a food safety standard-based knowledge graph with associated queries. This system serves as an efficient, accurate, and comprehensive in...",

        "abstract": "An analysis of actual optical ray paths in flat gradient-index (GRIN) lenses for multifocal multi-beam radiations is introduced in this paper. The formulation is rigorously established using the conservation of momentum applied to an offset focal point for the extreme beam generation. Assisted by the above analysis, a new lens design approach for GRIN profile synthesis is proposed with two extreme focal points, and then extended to determine a convenient locus of feed that allows for covering the scanning range with minimal overall aperture phase errors. The ray-path errors have been tested and compared with those of previously reported multi-beam GRIN lenses, which were based on a straight, parallel ray-path assumption inside the lens. The superiority and generality of the new design formulas have been proven by comparing lens prototypes from the two different methods. It is demonstrated that the proposed one can enable consistent gain enhancement for multiple beams at different operating frequencies. Finally, the new design method has been validated by implementing an all-dielectric 3-D printed seven-beam flat GRIN lens. A wide beam coverage of Â±44Â° has been realized with measured scanning losses between 1.2-2.93 dB at different frequencies. The measured 3-dB gain bandwidth is 42.8% covering 12.3-19 GHz.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a dual-circularly polarized (dual-CP) reflectarray (RA) based on a single-fed CP antenna element to achieve independent beam control. A novel methodology is proposed for designing the dual-CP RA, utilizing the technique of element rotation and true time delay. Contrary to traditional methods, it separate LHCP and RHCP waves into different channels and achieve independent manipulation simultaneously, based on the polarization selectivity of CP antenna element. The proposed CP antenna element consists of a branch line coupler and a square patch. The received RHCP wave is adjusted by phase delay line connected to its port, while the LHCP wave is controlled by element rotation. Finally, continuous phase compensation strategy is employed, and a RA antenna with a size of 8.4Î» Ã 8.4Î» and focal length of 0.86 times diameter is carried out. The experiment results demonstrate the independent beams pointing at (0Â°, â25Â°) and (0Â°, 15Â°) for LHCP and RHCP waves, respectively. The realized gain of each beams peaked 24.1 and 24.0 dBic. The bandwidth with simultaneous 2-dB gain variation and 3-dB axial ratio achieves 23.4% (23.7%) for LHCP (RHCP) beam, with a profile of only 0.09Î». The aperture efficiency is 28.8%.",

        "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) has been applied to various scenarios, including scene understanding, visual-language representation, and domain adaptation. Despite numerous endeavours and significant advancements, the crucial issues of fuzzy conceptualization of visual attributes and insufficient inter-class connectivity, have remained insufficiently addressed. To address these issues, we propose Learning Visual Attributes Representation for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (LVAR-CZSL), which has the ability to learn visual attributes and inter-class dependencies. LVAR-CZSL is mainly composed of two key components: the Visual Attribute Representation Module (VARM) and the Connected Learning Module (CLM). Specifically, VARM extracts detailed attributes and object visual features from global visual features, resolving the issue of fuzzy visual attribute concepts. Moreover, CLM endows LVAR-CZSL with the capability to perceive connectivity between different attributes and objects, effectively enhancing inter-class connectivity. To establish a close connection between VARM and CLM and minimize the gap between image and text features, we introduce the composition-attribute-object Joint Scoring Function (JSF). Additionally, we propose Joint Loss Function (JLF) to optimize the learning process of VARM and CLM. The experiment results on four datasets show that LVAR-CZSL achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/mxjmxj1/LVAR-CZSL.",

        "abstract": "Real-time awareness of crowd counts and distribution is vital for applications like crowd management, traffic control, and urban planning. Compared to vision-based methods, passive Wi-Fi sensing-based approaches offer advantages such as lower deployment costs, broader coverage, and greater scalability, and thus have become prevalent for fine-grained crowd analysis, e.g., estimating mobile device locations and subsequently inferring crowd density maps (CDMs). Therein, substantial localization errors are often incurred due to significant measurement noises, and even worse, the sporadic active scanning introduces sparsity in localization-based density maps (DMs), degrading the accuracy of resulting crowd analysis. To address these challenges, Wi-FDM, a passive Wi-Fi sensing-based framework for fine-grained CDM estimation, is proposed. Specifically, to mitigate the considerable localization errors, two models based on convolutional neural networks are employed to capture the relationship between RSS fingerprints and various locations more effectively; to alleviate the sparsity in localization-based DMs, deep compressed sensing networks are developed to reconstruct fine-grained CDMs by recover missing spatial details; to efficiently transfer the CDM reconstruction capabilities developed on semi-synthetic datasets to diverse real-world scenarios, learnable linear and convolutional residual blocks were designed to establish correlations across environments, addressing variations in scene characteristics and improving model generalization. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate Wi-FDM not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 41.8% and 29.3% in crowd counts and distribution estimation but is also applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its potential for crowd management and analysis.",

        "abstract": "Clinical staging is crucial for treatment strategies and improving 5-year survival rates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, existing methods struggle to distinguish stages with highly similar textual features. Additionally, their lack of interpretability hampers their practical application in medical scenarios. Here, we introduce KnowST, a joint-knowledge network designed to leverage task relevance to explore implicit knowledge for interpretable staging prediction of liver cancer. First, the relevance of auxiliary tasks and the main task is established from two perspectives to guide the model's focus on staging-related implicit knowledge in radiology reports. Stages-to-stages: KnowST learns the inter-stage distinctions between different stages and the similarities within the same stages, using these as important references for staging differentiation. Factors-to-stages: Clinically, staging is determined by multiple tumor factors. These factors can serve as effective clues to assist KnowST in predicting the correct stage, especially in the case of confusing stages. Second, domain-specific word embeddings are introduced to bridge the gap between pre-trained language models and Chinese radiology reports. Lastly, tumor factor prediction enhances the credibility of the deep model in staging prediction, and its visualized results effectively demonstrate the model's interpretability. Overall, KnowST leverages the joint-knowledge from these two perspectives, effectively utilizing implicit information in radiology reports to achieve interpretable clinical staging. Compared to the optimal baselines, KnowST improves AUC by 7.69% and achieves 90.52% accuracy on 573 real-world radiology reports, while also demonstrating superior stage identification and stable performance across various metrics.",

        "abstract": "This letter proposes a tri-polarization reconfigurable diversity antenna with integrated filtering functions based on ellipse-shaped metasurfaces (MTS). The antenna consists of three layers: the feedline layer, the coupled aperture layer, and the MTS layer. To get a low-frequency radiation null, the complementary split ring resonators (CSRR) are loaded on the coupled aperture layer, utilizing resonant characteristics. Furthermore, a non-radiation characteristics mode of the MTS is excited for a high-frequency radiation null. Thus, a filtering function of the proposed antenna is provided. Besides, there are three coupled slots on the aperture layer. Six sets of PIN diodes are inserted on the microstrip and coupled aperture. Through controlling the PIN diode, the polarization reconfigurability is obtained by choosing different coupled slots and changing the associated electric field vector. Eventually, the proposed antenna could switch between linear polarization (LP), left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). In the experiment, the proposed antenna shows a wide -10-dB impedance bandwidth (IMBW) of 29% and 29.5% for LP and CP modes. While operating in CP modes, the antenna has a wide measured 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 29%. Meanwhile, the out-of-band radiation suppression level in low-frequency is more than 30 and 20 dB for LP and CP modes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "While multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely developed for natural image analysis, its potential for enhancing performance in medical imaging remains relatively unexplored. Most methods formulate MTL as a multi-objective problem, inherently forcing all tasks to compete with each other during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel approach by formulating MTL as a multi-level optimization problem, in which the features learned from one task are optimized by benefiting from the other tasks. Specifically, we advocate for a cooperative approach where each task considers the features of others, enabling individual performance enhancement without detriment to others. To achieve this objective, we introduce a novel optimization strategy aimed at seeking flat minima for each sub-problem, fostering the learning of robust sub-models resilient to changes in other sub-models. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method through comprehensive parameter and comparison studies on the OrganCMNIST dataset. Additionally, we evaluate its efficacy on three eye-related medical image datasets, comparing its performance against other state-of-the-art MTL approaches. The results highlight the superiority of our method over existing approaches, showcasing its potential for training multi-purpose models in medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer screening often relies on cost-intensive MRIs and invasive needle biopsies. Transrectal ultrasound imaging, as a more affordable and non-invasive alternative, faces the challenge of high inter-class similarity and intra-class variability between benign and malignant prostate cancers. This complexity requires more stringent differentiation of subtle features for accurate auxiliary diagnosis. In response, we introduce the novel Deep Augmented Metric Learning (DAML) network, specifically tailored for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. The DAML network represents a significant innovation in the metric learning space, introducing the Semantic Differences Mining Strategy (SDMS) to effectively discern and represent subtle differences in prostate ultrasound images, thereby enhancing tumor classification accuracy. Additionally, the DAML network strategically addresses class variability and limited sample sizes by combining the Linear Interpolation Augmentation Strategy (LIAS) and Permutation-Aided Reconstruction Loss (PARL). This approach enriches feature representation and introduces variability with straightforward structures, mirroring the efficacy of advanced sample generation techniques. We carried out comprehensive empirical assessments of the DAML model by testing its key components against a range of models, ensuring its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the DAML model, achieving classification accuracies of 0.857 and 0.888 for benign and malignant cancers, respectively, underscoring its effectiveness in prostate cancer classification via medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "In the era of big data, enterprises have accumulated large amounts of valuable data throughout the entire product life cycle (PLC). Such PLC data contains a wealth of design knowledge. Intelligent manufacturing seeks to establish a collaborative platform that integrates advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence into the manufacturing process, providing new opportunities for efficient and intelligent product design. Mining design knowledge from PLC data and applying it to the design stage is a critical issue that urgently needs to be addressed for data-driven product design (DDPD). To enhance the efficiency and adaptability of DDPD, this work proposes a comprehensive framework for extracting design knowledge from PLC data and utilizing the knowledge to inform the design process. A structured storage method is developed to manage PLC data with multi-source and heterogeneous characteristics. Then, human-machine collaborative pattern extraction, deep learning-based relation extraction, and other data mining techniques are used to extract knowledge from PLC data. Moreover, a product design knowledge network is constructed based on knowledge graph to achieve knowledge organization and management. Finally, a novel intelligent push method for product design knowledge, based on context navigation, is proposed as part of the framework. A case study showcases how data-driven human-machine collaborative patterns can be used to improve the flexibility and performance of product design. Note to Practitioners âData-driven method can realize the closed-loop design of products while linking users, products and production processes to improve design efficiency. However, one of the major challenges in DDPD is the need to flexibly extract knowledge from PLC data and push them to designers. In this work, we propose a novel system that leverages human-machine collaboration and deep learning methods to realize DDPD toward intelligent manufacturing. It allows us to extract knowl...",

        "abstract": "Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) do not produce their own insulin. They must continuously monitor their glucose and make decisions about insulin dosing to avoid the consequences of adverse glucose excursions. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and insulin pumps are state-of-the-art systems that can help people with T1D manage their glucose. Accurate glucose prediction algorithms are becoming critical components of CGM systems that can help people with T1D proactively avoid the occurrence of impending hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia events. We present Glucop30, a robust data-driven glucose prediction model that is trained on a big dataset (27,466 days) to forecast glucose concentration along a short-term prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Our proposed prediction method is composed of (i) a recurrent neural network with long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units that predicts the general trend of future glucose levels, followed by (ii) a patient-specific smoothing error correction step that accounts for inter- and intra-patient glucose variability. We retrospectively test our proposed method on a clinical dataset obtained from 10 T1D insulin pump users who were continuously monitored during a 4-week trial under free-living conditions (255 days), and assess the impact of the size of the training set on the accuracy of the proposed model. In addition, we report on the accuracy of our method when both CGM and insulin data are used for prediction; however we discovered that adding insulin as an additional input feature improves prediction accuracy by only 1%. Glucop30 achieves leading performance as measured by the RMSE of 7.55 (SD = 2.20 mg/dL) and MAE of 4.89 (SD = 1.43 mg/dL) for an effective prediction horizon of 27.50 (SD = 2.64) minutes. Moreover, Glucop30 accurately anticipates the occurrence of 97.79 (SD = 5.35)% of hyperglycemia events (glucose > 180 mg/dL), and 90.87 (SD = 6.79)% of hypoglycemia events (glucose < 70 mg/dL) with remarkably few false alerts (1 ...",

Traditional methods struggle with limited data, as they rely on large datasets for encoding and decoding information. To solve problem, this paper proposes a novel MS-DeepSC framework based on meta-learning with stochastic gradient descent (Meta-SGD), which includes a lightweight S-Receiver receiver inspired by MobileNetV2 and a self-attention dynamic embedding encoding (SA-DEE) technique. These innovations reduce the dependence on large datasets and enhance adaptability to channel noise. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the modelâs ability to perform downstream tasks under data-scarce conditions, making it suitable for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Large neural network models are hard to deploy on lightweight edge devices demanding large network bandwidth. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) model compression method. Specifically, we present a dual-model training strategy with an iterative and adaptive rank reduction (RR) in tensor decomposition. Our method regularizes the DL models while preserving model accuracy. With adaptive RR, the hyperparameter search space is significantly reduced. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence and complexity of the proposed method. Testing our method for the LeNet, VGG, ResNet, EfficientNet, and RevCol over MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet datasets, our method outperforms the baseline compression methods in both model compression and accuracy preservation. The experimental results validate our theoretical findings. For the VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 dataset, our compressed model has shown a 0.88% accuracy gain with 10.41 times storage reduction and 6.29 times speedup. For the ResNet-50 on ImageNet dataset, our compressed model results in 2.36 times storage reduction and 2.17 times speedup. In federated learning (FL) applications, our scheme reduces 13.96 times the communication overhead. In summary, our compressed DL method can improve the image understanding and pattern recognition processes significantly.",

        "abstract": "Medical question answering aims to enhance diagnostic support, improve patient education, and assist in clinical decision-making by automatically answering medicalrelated queries, which is an important foundation for realizing intelligent healthcare. Existing methods predominantly focus on extracting key information from a single data source, e.g., CT image, for answering. However, these methods are not enough to promote the development of intelligent healthcare, because they lack comprehensive medical diagnosis capabilities, which usually require the integration of multi-source data (e.g., laboratory tests, radiology images, pathology images, etc.) for processing. To address these limitations, our paper introduces the extended task of medical question answering, named medical diagnosis question answering MedDQA. MedDQA task aims to answer questions related to medical diagnosis based on multi-source data. Specifically, we introduce a corresponding dataset that incorporates multi-source diagnostic information from 250,917 patients in clinical data from hospital records, and utilize a large-scale model for constructing Q&A pairs. We propose a novel system based on large language models, named medical multi-agent (MMA) system, which includes a mechanism of multiple agents to handle different medical tasks. Each agent is specifically tailored to process various modalities of data and provide outputs in a uniform textual modality. Experimental results demonstrate that the MMA systemâs architecture significantly enhances the handling of multi-source data, thereby improving medical diagnosis, establishing a robust baseline for future research.",

        "abstract": "Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have achieved effective performance in solving complex data-driven optimization problems. In the Internet of Things environment, the data of many problems are collected and processed in distributed network nodes and cannot be transmitted. As each local node can only access and build surrogate models based on partial data, local models are usually not accurate and even conflicting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a classifier-ensemble-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (CESAEA) with the following features. First, the local nodes in CESAEA train classifiers as surrogate models based on their own data to classify candidates into several levels according to their fitness quality. The classifiers are less sensitive to the partial and biased data than regression models in local nodes. Second, the central node in CESAEA ensembles the local surrogates to form a global classifier with a relaxation condition to guide the evolutionary optimizer to generate promising candidates. The relaxation condition helps to overcome the problem of local model inconsistency. Overall, CESAEA is composed of local classifier construction, global classifier ensemble, classifier-assisted evolutionary optimization and local regression-assisted selection. As only classifiers are allowed to transmit from local nodes to the central node, the mapping relationship between decision vector and objective is hidden and thus data privacy is protected. The experimental results on benchmark functions as well as distributed feature selection problems verify the effectiveness of CESAEA compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of data size, a large number of data providers outsource their private data to cloud servers to reduce the high storage and computation burdens, but it also leads to security issues such as privacy leakage. Therefore, many privacy-preserving range query schemes have been proposed. However, most of existing secure range query schemes suffer from low query efficiency and expensive computation and update overheads. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast Range Query (FRQ) scheme for large-scale encrypted Key-Value (KV) data. First, we introduce REMIX, a space-efficient KV index data structure based on Log-Structured Merge-trees (LSM-trees), which maintains a global sorted view of KV pairs across multiple table files for efficient range queries. Besides, we exploit the write-efficiency compression strategy of LSM-trees to ensure efficient dynamic data updates. Finally, we use Czech Havas Majewski (CHM) to protect the index structure, which reduces the computation overhead and ensures the retrieval accuracy. Formal security analysis proves that our scheme can achieve an acceptable level of security. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme improves the query efficiency by nearly $8\times$ and update efficiency by $7\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions over million-level datasets.",

        "abstract": "The rapid expansion and intelligent development of railway infrastructure are driving significant growth in railway engineering data. For the dispersed users across railway networksâ complex topology, traditional centralized storage systems are insufficient for their low-latency, cost-efficient data retrieval. Existing edge caching solutions based on multi-agent reinforcement learning fail to address the asymmetric relationships among railway nodes, such as data centers, stations, and sections, etc. Besides, the complexity of computing Nash equilibrium points also gets higher as the number of agents (edge caching servers) increases. This study introduces a Hierarchical Game model-based MADRL-driven Collaborative Edge Caching method(HG-MCEC) tailored for railway engineering data. By considering the distribution characteristics and caching strategy games among railway nodes, a hierarchical game model for collaborative edge caching is constructed. This model treats the railway edge caching as a multi-agent system, in which each railway node server is regarded as an agent. HG-MCEC utilizes deep learning to mitigate computational complexity and recognize agentsâ asymmetry. Upper-level agents adjust cache replacement strategies according to environmental changes and decisionmaking experience. Lower-level agents, under the guidance of upper-level decisions, optimize collaborative caching strategies toward achieving hierarchical game equilibrium. Using a highspeed railway building information modeling data for validation, the method significantly outperforms existing approaches by enhancing content hit rates and reducing latency at edge caching servers while decreasing system content transmission costs.",

        "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity presents a significant challenge in predicting drug responses, especially as missense mutations within the same gene can lead to varied outcomes such as drug resistance, enhanced sensitivity, or therapeutic ineffectiveness. These complex relationships highlight the need for advanced analytical approaches in oncology. Due to their powerful ability to handle heterogeneous data, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) represent a promising approach for predicting drug responses. However, simple bipartite graphs cannot accurately capture the complex relationships involved in missense mutation and drug response. Furthermore, Deep learning models for drug response are often considered âblack boxesâ, and their interpretability remains a widely discussed issue. To address these challenges, we propose an Interpretable Dynamic Directed Graph Convolutional Network (IDDGCN) framework, which incorporates four key features: (1) the use of directed graphs to differentiate between sensitivity and resistance relationships, (2) the dynamic updating of node weights based on node-specific interactions, (3) the exploration of associations between different mutations within the same gene and drug response, and (4) the enhancement of interpretability models through the integration of a weighted mechanism that accounts for the biological significance, alongside a ground truth construction method to evaluate prediction transparency. The experimental results demonstrate that IDDGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, exhibiting excellent predictive power. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of its interpretability further highlight its ability to explain predictions, offering a fresh perspective for precision oncology and targeted drug development.",

        "abstract": "In the era of data information explosion, there are different observations on an object (e.g., the height of the Himalayas) from different sources on the web, social sensing, crowd sensing, and data sensing applications. Observations from different sources on an object can conflict with each other due to errors, missing records, typos, outdated data, etc. How to discover truth facts for objects from various sources is essential and urgent. In this paper, we aim to deliver a comprehensive and exhaustive survey on truth discovery problems from the perspectives of concepts, methods, applications, and opportunities. We first systematically review and compare problems from objects, sources, and observations. Based on these problem properties, different methods are analyzed and compared in depth from observation with single or multiple values, independent or dependent sources, static or dynamic sources, and supervised or unsupervised learning, followed by the surveyed applications in various scenarios. For future studies in truth discovery fields, we summarize the code sources and datasets used in above methods. Finally, we point out the potential challenges and opportunities on truth discovery, with the goal of shedding light and promoting further investigation in this area.",

        "abstract": "The range search in Hamming space is to explore the binary vectors whose Hamming distances with a query vector are within a given searching threshold. It arises as the core component of many applications, such as image retrieval, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Existing searching methods in Hamming space require much pre-processing overhead, which are not suitable for processing multiple batches of incoming data in a short time. Moreover, significant pre-processing overhead can be a burden when the number of queries is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a query-aware method for the approximate range search in Hamming space with no pre-process. Specifically, to eliminate the impact of data skewness, we introduce JS-divergence to measure the divergence between data's distribution and query's distribution, and specially design a Query-Aware Dimension Partitioning (QADP) strategy to partition the dimensions into several subspaces according to the scales of given searching thresholds. In the subspaces, the candidates can be efficiently obtained by the basic Pigeonhole Principle and our proposed Anti-Pigeonhole Principle. Furthermore, a sampling strategy is designed to estimate the Hamming distance between the query vector and arbitrary binary vector to obtain the final approximate searching results among the candidates. Experimental results on four real-world datasets illustrate that, in comparison with benchmark methods, our method possesses the superior advantages on searching accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method can increase the searching efficiency up to nearly 16 times with high searching accuracy.",

        "abstract": "User profiling has very important applications for many downstream tasks. Most existing methods only focus on modeling user profiles of one social network with plenty of data. However, user profiles are difficult to acquire, especially when the data is scarce. Fortunately, we observed that similar users have similar behavior patterns in different social networks. Motivated by such observations, in this paper, we for the first time propose to study the user profiling problem from the transfer learning perspective. We design two efficient frameworks for User Profile transferring acrOss Networks, i.e., UPON and E-UPON. In UPON, we first design a novel graph convolutional networks based characteristic-aware domain attention model to find user dependencies within and between domains (i.e., social networks). We then design a dual-domain weighted adversarial learning method to address the domain shift problem existing in the transferring procedure. In E-UPON, we optimize UPON in terms of computational complexity and memory. Specifically, we design a mini-cluster gradient descent based graph representation algorithm to shrink the searching space and ensure parallel computation. Then we use an adaptive cluster matching method to adjust the clusters of users. Experimental results on Twitter-Foursquare dataset demonstrate that UPON and E-UPON outperform the state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "In real-world crowdsourcing scenarios, it is a common phenomenon that each worker only annotates a few instances, resulting in a significantly sparse crowdsourcing label matrix. Consequently, only a small number of workers influence the inferred integrated label of each instance, which may weaken the performance of label integration algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a novel label completion algorithm called Worker Similarity-based Label Completion (WSLC). WSLC is grounded on the assumption that workers with similar cognitive abilities will annotate similar labels on the same instances. Specifically, we first construct a data set for each worker that includes all instances annotated by this worker and learn a feature vector for each worker. Then, we define a metric based on cosine similarity to estimate worker similarity based on the learned feature vectors. Finally, we complete the labels for each worker on unannotated instances based on the worker similarity and the annotations of similar workers. The experimental results on one real-world and 34 simulated crowdsourced data sets consistently show that WSLC effectively addresses the problem of the sparse crowdsourcing label matrix and enhances the integration accuracies of label integration algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Label distribution learning (LDL) suffers from the dilemma of insufficient target data in real-world applications, while domain adaptation (DA) seems to be able to provide a solution. However, most existing methods of DA, assuming that the instances can correspond to the explicit class information, are devoted only to classification but not to LDL. We argue that indiscriminately applying such DA methods might cause performance degradation in LDL tasks. In this paper, we propose LDL-DA, a novel algorithm dedicated to supervised domain adaptation for label distribution learning, which jointly learns a shared encoding representation from two aspects: (1) contrastive alignment of scarce supervised target data, and (2) minimizing the distance between prototypes of the same label combination. Experiments show that LDL-DA outperforms existing DA methods adapted to LDL, and provides early positive results in DA for LDL. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first research on DA for LDL.",

        "abstract": "Cybercrime poses a severe threat to the entire Internet ecosystem. Various cyber assets, such as domain name, IP address, and security certificate, are staple infrastructures of cybercrime. A cyber asset graph (CAG) is a collection of closely related cyber assets held by a cybercrime gang to support online criminal activities. Analyzing CAGs provides rich data insights for cybercrime investigation and governance. This paper introduces an open dataset of CAGs comprised of 2.37 million nodes with eight types of cyber assets and 3.28 million edges with eleven types of relations. This paper introduces the dataset construction process, applied areas, and the experience of using the dataset in the ChinaVis Data Challenge 2022. This dataset contains numerous CAGs of cybercrime gangs in the real world, which is the first open dataset of CAGs for cybercrime research. This dataset can also support the development of other application-oriented areas, such as cyber asset management and cyber-physical-social system, and various graph-related research areas, such as graph theory, graph mining, and graph visualization.",

        "abstract": "Data similarity assumptions have traditionally been relied upon to understand the convergence behaviors of federated learning methods. Unfortunately, this approach often demands fine-tuning step sizes based on the level of data similarity. When data similarity is low, these small step sizes result in an unacceptably slow convergence speed for federated methods. In this paper, we present a novel and unified framework for analyzing the convergence of federated learning algorithms without the need for data similarity conditions. Our analysis centers on an inequality that captures the influence of step sizes on algorithmic convergence performance. By applying our theorems to well-known federated algorithms, we derive precise expressions for three widely used step size schedules: fixed, diminishing, and step-decay step sizes, which are independent of data similarity conditions. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of the performance of these federated learning algorithms, employing the proposed step size strategies to train deep neural network models on benchmark datasets under varying data similarity conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed and overall performance, marking a substantial advancement in federated learning research.",

        "abstract": "Capsule networks (CapsNets) have been known difficult to develop a deeper architecture, which is desirable for high performance in the deep learning era, due to the complex capsule routing algorithms. In this article, we present a simple yet effective capsule routing algorithm, which is presented by a residual pose routing. Specifically, the higher-layer capsule pose is achieved by an identity mapping on the adjacently lower-layer capsule pose. Such simple residual pose routing has two advantages: 1) reducing the routing computation complexity and 2) avoiding gradient vanishing due to its residual learning framework. On top of that, we explicitly reformulate the capsule layers by building a residual pose block. Stacking multiple such blocks results in a deep residual CapsNets (ResCaps) with a ResNet-like architecture. Results on MNIST, AffNIST, SmallNORB, and CIFAR-10/100 show the effectiveness of ResCaps for image classification. Furthermore, we successfully extend our residual pose routing to large-scale real-world applications, including 3-D object reconstruction and classification, and 2-D saliency dense prediction. The source code has been released on https://github.com/liuyi1989/ResCaps.",

        "abstract": "In some recommendation platforms, the recommended items are composed of the complex text, and the target users are also described by the complex text. These texts are usually long, highly specialized, logically structured, and have significant differences, such as recommending technical demands of enterprises to technology researchers. Although some recommendation methods based on text representation can be used to solve this problem, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), they may encounter challenges from different perspectives, e.g., path connectivity of representations, and the relationship between representations and recommended items. The complex text recommendation is an important problem that remains largely unsolved. In order to overcome the aforementioned challenges, by taking the technology commercialization as an example, which aims to recommend demands to researchers, we propose a novel complex text recommendation model called M ulti-order A ttention and S emantic E nhanced R epresentation (MASER). By integrating additional information into text vector representationsuch as structural relationship information for extended keywords, and semantic information for entity description texts the proposed model enhances complex text recommendation effectiveness significantly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real datasets, confirming the advantages of the MASER model and the attention mechanism's effectiveness on complex text recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Fairness has emerged as a crucial concern in machine learning since biased models would generate dissimilar predictions for different groups, perpetuating social inequalities. Although numerous techniques have been proposed to address the fairness issue in machine learning, most rely on incorporating fairness constraints during the training phase, rendering them ineffective once the model is deployed. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning biased models to enhance fairness, particularly suitable for scenarios where retraining the model is not feasible. Our approach is rooted in an empirical analysis of the distribution of bias within a biased model, and we fine-tune the model parameter in a limited scope so that the performance of the original model can be maintained. We first observe that fine-tuning a biased model leads to deviations from its initial state, with deep layers undergoing the most significant changes. We then design and apply a bias-discovery algorithm, revealing that bias predominantly resides in the model's deep layers. Based on these observations, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective method for debiasing the model: fine-tuning the classification head. We conduct a thorough theoretical analysis to justify the proposed method and provide guidance for fine-tuning. Furthermore, we experimentally validate our method on tabular and image datasets using four networks (CNN, AlexNet, VGG-11, and ResNet-18).",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of 5G communication technology in the era of big data, massive terminal devices connected to the Internet have dramatically increased the scale of network, generating a large amount of high-dimensional and heterogeneous information. This not only enhances the difficulty of information processing in the network, but also poses a severe challenge to data storage and calculation, which has become a big data problem to be solved urgently. To cope with it, this paper proposes an efficient information processing framework and applies it to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection. Overall, three major highlights are made: (1) Tensor is used to represent multi-modal information in large-scale networks; (2) A novel denoising algorithm based on tensor train(TT) decomposition is proposed, focused on optimizing both computation and correlation; (3) A big data-driven information processing framework is developed, which includes information preprocessing, denoising and classification. Results in case study indicate that the framework can achieve an accuracy of 99.19%, all while maintaining the great storage advantage, well speedup ratio and strong computing capabilities under the same computational complexity. It can also be generalized to other network data processing scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the issue of risk-avoid lightpath provision in multi-domain space division multiplexing (SDM) elastic optical data center networks (SDM-EODCNs). The service requests are categorized as intra-domain or inter-domain, and inter-domain requests are further classified as trusted or untrusted. A system model is presented, including a network model, a service request model, an inter-core crosstalk (IC-XT) model, and a risk model between service requests. To reduce the blocking probability of service requests while avoiding security risk, an integer linear programming (ILP) model is formulated to minimize the maximum index of frequency slots occupied by all types of service requests. Furthermore, a risk-avoid lightpath provision algorithm (RALPA) is proposed, consisting of different algorithms like data center selection, core prioritization, frequency block determination, and core and frequency slot allocation. RALPA ensures that trusted service requests remain secure from potential attacks by untrusted ones. Additionally, core priorities are dynamically generated for different service requests, reducing the search space and improving the search's time efficiency. Finally, the ILP model is solved in small-scale topology, and large-scale simulation experiments are conducted on various network topologies and core structures. The results show that our RALPA algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of blocking probability and utilization of network resources.",

        "abstract": "Contribution: This study proposes a student dropout prediction model, named image convolutional and bi-directional temporal convolutional network (IC-BTCN), which makes dropout prediction for learners based on the learning clickstream data of students in massive open online courses (MOOCs) courses. Background: The MOOCs learning platform attracts hundreds of millions of users with in-depth teaching content and low-threshold learning methods. However, the high-dropout rate has always been its weakness compared with offline teaching. Intended Outcomes: The effectiveness of IC-BTCN model is evaluated on the KDD CUP 2015 dataset, including a large amount of clickstream data from the online learning platforms. The experimental results show that IC-BTCN model achieves an accuracy rate of 89.3 $\\%$ . Application Design: First, learning record data of students are converted into 3-D learning behavior matrix. Then, local features of the behavior matrix are extracted through convolutional techniques. These extracted learning features are then input into a temporal convolutional network to further refine the data. The temporal learning features of students are extracted through dilated causal convolution. Finally, a multilayer perceptron is used to derive the dropout prediction for students. Findings: Compared with three typical deep learning models, IC-BTCN model is advanced in accuracy and other evaluation indicators. On the premise of complying with the provisions of MOOCs platforms, the IC-BTCN model has good portability and practicability.",

        "abstract": "Open radio access network (ORAN)-based vehicular networks play a pivotal role in future traffic data sharing. Due to the openness of the ORAN framework, it is necessary to encrypt the sharing data to prevent unauthorized access or misuse by malicious participants. However, current efforts struggle to address some emerging security requirements, such as the bilateral control of sending and access rights in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications, as well as evolving replay attack on encrypted data. With these challenges, this paper presents a fine-grained access control encryption (FGACE) scheme for secure communication in ORAN-based vehicular networks. Our FGACE enables fine-grained and bilateral control over senders and receivers. We design a novel sanitization algorithm against dishonest sanitizer and replay attack. Furthermore, we deeply explore security models for replay attack on encrypted data to support secure sanitization, i.e., attribute-based replayable CCA security and related definitions. We prove that our FGACE satisfies the proposed security definitions. Feature comparison demonstrates that our scheme does better in security and privacy. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms compared schemes. When the number of attributes increases to 50, our total computational overhead is lowest, and the total storage overhead is approximately less than 1/3 of other schemes. The impressive performance indicates that our FGACE is practical in ORAN-based vehicular networks.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a promising technique to enable distributed machine learning over edge nodes without relying on a centralized parameter server. However, existing DFL network topologies, such as fully connected, partially connected, or lower-tier hierarchical topology often struggle to effectively address the unique challenges presented by edge networks, including edge heterogeneity, communication resource constraint, and data Non-IID. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a data-aware clustering algorithm, called FRACTAL, to construct a multi-tier hierarchical topology in a bottomup manner taking into consideration both data distribution and communication efficiency for DFL. We theoretically explore the quantitative relationship between the convergence bound of multi-tier FL and the data distribution among each-tier servers. To further improve communication efficiency and address edge heterogeneity, we deploy a time-sharing communication scheduling algorithm within each fractal unit (the basic structure in FRACTAL consisting of multiple nodes and an aggregator), called magic mirror method (MMM), to determine the optimal order of model distributing and uploading for nodes. We conduct extensive experiments on the classical models and datasets to evaluate the performance of FRACTAL, and the results show that FRACTAL can significantly accelerate the DFL model training by 48.6%- 72.3% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.",

        "abstract": "Sunlight and shadow play critical roles in how urban spaces are utilized, thrive, and grow. While access to sunlight is essential to the success of urban environments, shadows can provide shaded places to stay during the hot seasons, mitigate heat island effect, and increase pedestrian comfort levels. Properly quantifying sunlight access and shadows in large urban environments is key in tackling some of the important challenges facing cities today. In this paper, we propose Deep Umbra, a novel computational framework that enables the quantification of sunlight access and shadows at a global scale. Our framework is based on a conditional generative adversarial network that considers the physical form of cities to compute high-resolution spatial information of accumulated sunlight access for the different seasons of the year. We use data from seven different cities to train our model, and show, through an extensive set of experiments, its low overall RMSE (below 0.1) as well as its extensibility to cities that were not part of the training set. Additionally, we contribute a set of case studies and a comprehensive dataset with sunlight access information for more than 100 cities across six continents of the world. Deep Umbra is available at http://urbantk.org/shadows .",

To explore any evidence of age-gender effect on faculty career progression, gender compositions, promotion rates, and appointment lengths at the assistant and associate professor levels are investigated. Furthermore, the underlying factors influencing faculty performance evaluation decisions are analyzed using the commercial data provided by Academic Analytics, LLC, which comprises the scholarly records of 336,793 faculty members from 472 Ph.D.-granting universities in the United States during 2011-2020. Various machine learning techniques, including ensemble learning and association rule mining, are performed to determine the important features that provide the most significant insights into academic career growth. Our results indicate strong evidence of age-gender effect on faculty career advancement and underscore the significance of journal article and citation counts for career progression in higher education.",

        "abstract": "Log parsing, the process of transforming raw logs into structured data, is a key step in the complex computer system's intelligent operation and maintenance and therefore has received extensive attention. Among all log parsing methods, heuristic log parsing methods are lightweight and can work in a streaming mode to well meet the real-time parsing requirements. However, the existing log representations used in the heuristic log parsing methods are not powerful in distinguishing log messages, which leads to low parsing accuracy and weak generality. Inspired by trigger word extraction of the event detection task in natural language processing (NLP), this paper proposes an online log parser, named PosParser, which employs the part-of-speech (PoS) tagging to extract a function token sequence (FTS) as the log message representation, and then identify event templates of log messages through the FTS. Experimental results on sixteen logs from real systems demonstrate that the FTS is powerful in distinguishing log messages from different event templates, and PosParser not only performs better in terms of parsing accuracy than state-of-the-art methods but is also comparable to them in efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective approach for social recommender systems. GNNs excel at capturing the graph-structured semantic information within the collaborative interaction graph and social networks. Recently, some methods have introduced self-supervised learning to GNNs, aiming to enhance recommendation performance by mitigating the data sparsity issue. However, these methods treat the interaction graph and social network as separate entities, which severely limits the number of samples available for self-supervised learning. Moreover, these separated methods also exacerbate the problem of information islands in collaborative and social domains, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose an innovative self-supervised social recommendation method called Bi-directional Transfer Graph Contrastive Learning (BTGCL). BTGCL jointly encodes node representations within both collaborative domain and social domain, then generates node views through feature augmentation. To bridge the information gap between domains, we devise a bi-directional migration mechanism that aligns features from the collaborative and social domains of the same positive pair. Through extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing social recommendation performance.",

        "abstract": "Digital twins (DT) and mobile networks have evolved forms of intelligence in Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we consider a Digital Twin Mobile Network (DTMN) scenario with few multimedia samples. Facing challenges of knowledge extraction with few samples, stable interaction with dynamic changes of multimedia data, time and privacy saving in low-resource mobile network, we propose an edge computing and few-shot learning featured intelligent framework. Considering time-sensitive property of transmission and privacy risks of directly uploads in mobile network, we deploy edge computing to locally run networks for analysis, thus saving time to offload computing request and enhancing privacy by encrypting original data. Inspired by remarkable relationship representation of graphs, we build Graph Neural Network (GNN) in cloud to map physical mobile systems to virtual entities with DT, thus performing semantic inferences in cloud with few samples uploaded by edges. Occasionally, node features in GNN could converge to similar, non-discriminative embeddings, causing catastrophic unstable phenomena. An iterative reweight and drop structure (IRDS) is thus constructed in cloud, which nonetheless contributes stability with respect to edge uncertainty. As part of IRDS, a drop Edge&Node scheme is proposed to randomly remove certain nodes and edges, which not only enhances distinguished capability of graph neighbor patterns, but also offers data encryption with random strategy. We show one implementation case of image classification in social network, where experiments on public datasets show that our framework is effective with user-friendly advantages and significant intelligence.",

Before conducting tests or evaluations, the customer must first encrypt the data and then decrypt it. Since consumers use several main cycles for the whole operation, which creates noise and computation overheads, the growth rate of computation overheads has increased. The growing ratio of noise to computation rate can interrupt the whole system, resulting in machine instability, protection, and privacy concerns. To resolve the security and privacy issues, the proposed schemes used different hardness assumptions, such as over-integer, learning with error, ideal lattices, bootstrapping, etc. In this paper, we presents a comprehensive review of HE and its many varieties. The numerous possible applications of HE are covered at a high level in order to highlight the extent to which HE is used in the IoT and other lighted-weighted intelligent industry environments in a variety of various domains.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for collaboratively training machine learning models among multiple participants while preserving privacy-sensitive data. However, the conventional parameter server architecture presents challenges in terms of communication overhead when employing iterative optimization methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Although communication compression techniques can reduce the traffic cost of FL during each training round, they often lead to degraded convergence rates, mainly due to compression errors and data heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper presents FedQClip, an innovative approach that combines quantization and Clipped SGD. FedQClip leverages an adaptive step size inversely proportional to the $\\ell_2$ norm of the gradient, effectively mitigating the negative impacts of quantized errors. Additionally, clipped operations can be applied locally and globally to further expedite training. Theoretical analyses provide evidence that, even under the settings of Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, FedQClip achieves a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$ , effectively addressing the convergence degradation caused by compression errors. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate number of local updates to enhance the convergence of FL training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedQClip outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of communication efficiency and convergence rate.",

        "abstract": "Clinical staging of liver cancer (CSoLC), an important indicator for evaluating the degree of deterioration of primary liver cancer cells (PLCCs), is key in the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of liver cancer. In China, the current CSoLC adopts the China liver cancer (CNLC) staging, which is usually evaluated by clinicians based on the patient's radiology reports. Therefore, inferring clinical information from unstructured radiology reports can provide auxiliary decision support for clinicians. The key to solving the challenging task is to guide the model to pay attention to the staging-related words or sentences, and the following issues may occur: 1) Imbalanced categories: The symptoms of liver cancer in the early- or mid-stage are not obvious, resulting in more data in the end-stage. 2) Domain sensitivity of liver cancer data: The liver cancer dataset contains a large amount of domain knowledge, and the conventional methods can exacerbate out-of-vocabulary, which greatly affects the accuracy of classification. 3) Free-text and lengthy report: The radiology report of liver cancer sparsely describes various lesions with domain-specific terms, which poses difficulties in mining key information related to staging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a large language model (LLM)-based Knowledge-aware Attention Network (LKAN) for CSoLC. First, for maintaining semantic consistency, LLM and a rule-based algorithm are integrated to generate more diverse and reasonable data. Second, unlabeled radiology corpus of liver cancer are pre-trained to introduce domain knowledge for subsequent representation learning. Third, attention is improved by incorporating both global and local features, which can provide professional guidance for the classifier to focus on the important information. Compared with the baseline models, the classification accuracy of LKAN has achieved the best results with 90.3% Accuracy, 90.0% Macro_F1 score, and 90.0% Macro_Recall. The...",

        "abstract": "The image hosting platform is becoming increasingly popular due to its user-friendly features, but it is prone to causing privacy concerns. Only protecting privacy, in fact, can be easy to come true, but usability is frequently sacrificed. Visual privacy protection schemes aim to make a balance between privacy and usability, whereas they are often irreversible. Recently, some reversible visual privacy protection schemes have been proposed by preserving thumbnails (known as TPE). However, they either have excessive states in the Markov chain modeled by the scheme or cannot reverse losslessly. Meanwhile, images encrypted by existing TPE schemes can not embed additional information and thus the usability is limited to visual observation. In view of this, we pertinently propose a reversible and usability-enhanced visual privacy protection scheme (called PR3) based on thumbnail preservation and data hiding. In this scheme, we utilize the sum-preserving data embedding algorithm to substitute the the lowest seven bits of the image without changing the sum. Any data overflow resulting from the above process is stored in the vacated space of the most significant bits. The remaining space serves two purposes: embedding additional information and adjusting the image to approximate the thumbnail. Compared with existing TPE works, PR3 has fewer states in the Markov chain and supports lossless recovery of images. In addition, additional information can be embedded in the encrypted image to enhance usability.",

        "abstract": "The traditional K-means algorithm is very sensitive to the selection of the initial clustering point and the calculation of the distance measure, which is likely to result in the convergence of only partly optimal solutions. An improved k-means algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of unbalanced clustering effect caused by the fact that the first initial clustering centre falls in the non-dense region of the boundary in the initial clustering centre optimisation process. An improved k-means algorithm for initial clustering centres is proposed, namely, the optimal matching algorithm for K-means clustering, and related experimental analysis of the algorithm is carried out. The improved algorithm first selects the initial points of the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and analyses the clustering results. Then, the initial clustering centre selection and distance determination were tested and the clustering effect was evaluated by introducing the contour coefficient. Experiments on both artificial data sets and UCI data sets show that the algorithm can achieve better clustering results. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a much higher clustering quality than the traditional K-means algorithm and other improved algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers an effective learning architecture to protect data privacy in a distributed manner. However, the inevitable network asynchrony, overdependence on a central coordinator, and lack of an open and fair incentive mechanism collectively hinder FLâs further development. We propose IronForge, a new generation of FL framework, that features a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based structure, where nodes represent uploaded models, and referencing relationships between models form the DAG that guides the aggregation process. This design eliminates the need for central coordinators to achieve fully decentralized operations. IronForge runs in a public and open network and launches a fair incentive mechanism by enabling state consistency in the DAG. Hence, the system fits in networks where training resources are unevenly distributed. In addition, dedicated defense strategies against prevalent FL attacks on incentive fairness and data privacy are presented to ensure the security of IronForge. Experimental results based on a newly developed test bed FLSim highlight the superiority of IronForge to the existing prevalent FL frameworks under various specifications in performance, fairness, and security. To the best of our knowledge, IronForge is the first secure and fully decentralized FL (DFL) framework that can be applied in open networks with realistic network and training settings.",

        "abstract": "Federated recommender systems (FRSs), with their improved privacy-preserving advantages to jointly train recommendation models from numerous devices while keeping user data distributed, have been widely explored in modern recommender systems (RSs). However, conventional FRSs require transmitting the entire model between the server and clients, which brings a huge carbon footprint for cost-conscious cross-device learning tasks. While several efforts have been dedicated to improving the efficiency of FRSs, itâs suboptimal to treat the whole model as the objective of compact design. Besides, current research fails to handle the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue in real-world FRSs, where the items only occasionally appear in the testing phase but were not observed during the training process, which is another practical challenge and has not been well studied yet. To this end, we propose a privacy-enhanced federated recommendation framework with shared hash embedding, PrivFR, in cross-device settings, which is an efficient representation mechanism specialized for the embedding parameters without compromising the model capability. Specifically, it represents items in a resource-efficient way by delicately utilizing shared hash embedding and multiple hash functions. As such, it just maintains a small shared pool of hash embedding in local clients, rather than fitting all embedding vectors for each item, which can exactly achieve the dual advantages of conserving resources and handling the OOV issue. Whatâs more, we prove that this mechanism can protect the data privacy of local clients from a theoretical perspective. Extensive experiments show that our method not only effectively reduces storage and communication overheads, but also outperforms state-of-the-art FRSs.",

        "abstract": "As a basic primitive in spatial and multimedia databases, the $k$ -nearest neighbors ( $k$ -NN) query has been widely used in electronic medicine, location-based services and so on. With the boom in cloud computing, it is currently a trend to upload massive data to the cloud server to enjoy its powerful storage and computing resources. Recently, research communities and commercial applications have proposed many schemes to support $k$ -NN query on cloud data. However, most of the existing schemes were designed under the assumption that the query users (QUs) are fully trusted and hold the key of the data owner (DO). In this case, even if the queries were encrypted, the QUs can capture the query content from each other, leading to the query privacy leakage. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, few $k$ -NN query schemes can ensure data security and result verification under the key confidentiality condition. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and privacy-preserving $k$ -NN query scheme with multiple keys (VP $k$ NN), in which each QU's partial private key can only decrypt the encrypted query results belonging to its own , but not the encrypted database, the encrypted query data and query results of other QUs. Moreover, our proposal not only answers the query efficiently, but also ensures the privacy of the data, the query and the result, and the verification of the correctness of the results. Finally, the complexity and security are theoretically analyzed, and the practicality and efficiency of our proposed scheme are compared by simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "Data privacy breaches have prompted growing concerns regarding privacy issues on social networks. Preserving the privacy of links in the directed social graph, where edges signify the information flow or data contributions, poses a formidable challenge. However, existing methods for uncertain graphs primarily target undirected graphs and lack rigorous privacy guarantees. In this paper, we present a personal evidence protection algorithm called PEPA, which provides formally dual privacy guarantees for directed social links. Specifically, we implement out-link privacy to protect the out-links of nodes. Despite this protection, the exposure of in-links can still compromise privacy, potentially affecting service quality. To address this, we further introduce an uncertain directed graph algorithm as a post-processing approach for out-link privacy. This algorithm injects uncertainty into nodes' in-links, effectively transforming the original directed graph into a probability-driven uncertain structure. Additionally, we propose an effective noise optimization method. Finally, we evaluate the trade-off between privacy and utility achieved by PEPA through comparative experiments. The results demonstrate privacy enhancements of PEPA compared to the $(k, \u000barepsilon )$ -obfuscation algorithm and utility improvements over the RandWalk algorithm and UG-NDP. Particularly, PEPA demonstrates approximately a 2- fold improvement in utility compared to PEPA without noise optimization.",

        "abstract": "Urban Rail Transit (URT) system is often disturbed by various types of security incidents during operation. Therefore, effective utilization of passenger in-transit information to dynamically assess the URT systemâs abilities to maintain and resume normal operation under disturbances (operational resilience) is the key and prerequisite for URT safety management and emergency response. Based on typical operational disruption scenario, this paper study the multimodal data-driven URT operational resilience and its evaluation methods. The main contributions of this research includes: capturing key information about passengers in the travel process based on historical data, and quantifying the systemâs service capabilities; proposing the concept of operational resilience oriented towards URT emergency management based on service level; employing the resilience curve to analyze the evolutionary patterns of URT service levels during safety events, and emphasizing the relativity and dynamism of operational resilience; constructing a two-stage âdisruption-recoveryâ URT operational resilience evaluation model and taking Hangzhou URT as an example to verify the effectiveness of the model through experiments. The results provide a good reference for URT safety status assessment and emergency response. Note to Practitioners âWith the expansion of urban rail transit scale, the passenger flow it undertakes is also increasing. Frequent security incidents can seriously disrupt the operation of urban rail transit, causing significant economic losses and even threatening the safety of passengers. If the ability of urban rail transit to resist safety incidents and restore normal operation can be understood in advance, it will help operation managers make reasonable judgments and emergency decisions. Therefore, this paper proposed an evaluation method for operational resilience with the service level of urban rail transit as the key.",

        "abstract": "Mirrors play a significant role in our daily lives and are ubiquitous. However, deep learning computer vision models find them challenging owing to the negative impact of reflected information on scene understanding. This study addresses two key challenges faced by multimodal models. First, the cross-modal variability of features at different stages is generally overlooked by contemporary backbone networks. Second, good performance has only been achieved at an unacceptable computational expense, owing to the numerous parameters used. To address the first challenge, we propose a differential-mode multistage adaptive fusion network (differential mode refers to images generated by different sensors that are differentiated to complement each other) that incorporates two-step fusion in the coding stage to account for the degrees of difference among the cross-modal features. In the first stage, wherein considerable differences in modal features exist, multi-angle fusion is performed. In the second stage, wherein the differences are smaller, a hierarchical adaptive fusion strategy is employed. Regarding the second challenge, we introduce a companion training framework for mirror segmentation that combines knowledge distillation and contrastive learning. Our proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on an available mirror segmentation dataset without requiring numerous parameters.",

        "abstract": "Network alignment, which integrates multiple network resources by identifying anchor nodes that exist in different networks, is beneficial for conducting comprehensive network analysis. Although there have been many studies on network alignment, most of them are limited to static scenarios and only can achieve acceptable top-\nÎ±\n(\nÎ±>10\n) results. In the absence of considering dynamic changes in networks, accurate network alignment (i.e., top-1 result) faces two problems: 1) Missing information: focusing solely on aligning networks at a specific time leads to low top-1 performance due to the lack of information from other time periods; 2) Confusing information: ignoring temporal information and focusing on aligning networks across the entire time span leads to low top-1 performance due to inability to distinguish the neighborhood nodes of anchor nodes. In this paper, we propose a dynamic network alignment method, which aims to achieve better top-1 alignment results with consider changing network structures over time. Towards this end, we learn the representations of nodes in the changing network structure with time, and preserve the consistency of anchor node pairs during the time-evolution process. Firstly, we employ a Structure-Time-aware module to capture network dynamics while preserving network structure and learning node representations that incorporate temporal information. Secondly, we ensure the global and local consistency of anchor node pairs over time by utilizing linear and similarity functions, respectively. Finally, we determine whether two nodes are anchor node pairs by maintaining consistency between global, local, and node representations. Experimental results obtained from real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves performance comparable to several state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge reasoning has been widely researched in knowledge graphs (KGs), but there has been relatively less research on hyper-relational KGs, which also plays an important role in downstream tasks. Existing reasoning methods on hyperrelational KGs are based on representation learning. Though this approach is effective, it lacks interpretability and ignores the graph structure information. In this paper, we make the first attempt at symbolic reasoning on hyper-relational KGs. We introduce rule extraction methods based on both individual facts and paths, and propose a rule-based symbolic reasoning approach, HyperPath. This approach is simple and interpretable, it can serve as a baseline model for symbolic reasoning in hyper-relational KGs. We provide experimental results on almost all datasets, including five large-scale datasets and seven subdatasets of them. Experiments show that the expressive power of the proposed model is similar to simple neural networks like convolutional networks, but not as advanced as more complex networks such as Transformer and graph convolutional networks, which is consistent with the performance of symbolic methods on KGs. Furthermore, we also analyze the impact of rule length and hyperparameters on the model's performance, which can provide insights for future research in hypergraph symbolic reasoning.

        "abstract": "Recommender systems face a daunting challenge when entities (users or items) without any historical interactions, known as the â Completely Cold-Start Problem â. Due to the absence of collaborative signals, Collaborative Filtering (CF) schema fails to deduce user preferences or item characteristics for such cold entities. A common solution is incorporating auxiliary discrete attributes as the bridge to spread collaborative signals to cold entities. Most previous works involve embedding collaborative signals and discrete attributes into different spaces before aligning them for information propagation. Nevertheless, we argue that the separate embedding approach disregards potential high-order similarities between two signals. Furthermore, existing alignment modules typically narrow the geometric-based distance, lacking in-depth exploration of semantic overlap between collaborative signals and cold entities. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete attribute-enhanced completely cold-start recommendation framework, which aims to improve recommendation performance by modeling heterogeneous signals in a unified space. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous user-item-attribute graph and capture high-order similarities between heterogeneous signals in a graph-based message-passing manner. To achieve better information alignment, we propose two self-supervised alignment modules from the semantic mutual information and user-item preference perspective. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets in two types of discrete attribute scenarios consistently verify the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge Bases (KBs) have become more complex because some facts in KBs include more than two entities. The construction and completion of these KBs require a new relation extraction task to retrieve complex facts from the text. To address this issue, we present a new N-ary Document-Level relation extraction task that involves extracting relations that 1) include an arbitrary number of entities, and 2) can span multiple sentences within a document. This new task requires inferring relation labels and entity completeness, i.e., whether the entities in the document are (insufficient to describe the relation. We propose a reinforcement learning-based relation classifier training framework that can adapt most existing binary document-level relation extractors to this task. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed framework is effective in reducing the impact of noise introduced by distant supervision or unrelated sentences in the document.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) reveal significant robustness deficiencies due to their susceptibility to being misled by small and imperceptible adversarial examples, thus it is crucial to improve the robustness of DNNs against such harmful perturbations. The current $L_{p}$ specification ignores differences in human visual perception when measuring similarity, and most existing image quality assessment (IQA) methods and adversarial example datasets lack subjective scores for evaluation. In this paper, we construct a new database of adversarial examples, called the AED, which contains 35 original images, 1050 adversarial examples, and the corresponding subjective scores of adversarial examples. Then, a novel full-reference IQA model for the quality evaluation of the adversarial examples is proposed by taking into full consideration the hierarchical perception of human visual system (HVS) and the outstanding capabilities of the multi-scale feature extraction network in feature extraction. Specifically, a feature encoding network that uses continuous convolution layers to pre-extract features and expand the receptive field of the image is employed. To simulate the HVS hierarchical perception, the features of different scales are further obtained by designing a multi-scale feature extraction network. The structural similarity scores of the feature maps at different scales are calculated for jointly arriving at the final IQA score of the adversarial examples. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model is closer to the perception of HVS in small imperceptible distortions evaluation of adversarial examples compared with other classical and state-of- the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Fact verification tasks aim to identify the integrity of textual contents according to the truthful corpus. Existing fact verification models usually build a fully connected reasoning graph, which regards claim-evidence pairs as nodes and connects them with edges. They employ the graph to propagate the semantics of the nodes. Nevertheless, the noisy nodes usually propagate their semantics via the edges of the reasoning graph, which misleads the semantic representations of other nodes and amplifies the noise signals. To mitigate the propagation of noisy semantic information, we introduce a Confidential Graph Attention Network (CO-GAT), which proposes a node masking mechanism for modeling the nodes. Specifically, CO-GAT calculates the node confidence score by estimating the relevance between the claim and evidence pieces. Then, the node masking mechanism uses the node confidence scores to control the noise information flow from the vanilla node to the other graph nodes. CO-GAT achieves a 73.59% FEVER score on the FEVER dataset and shows the generalization ability by broadening the effectiveness to the science-specific domain.",

        "abstract": "Superpixel segmentation is a powerful image pre-processing tool in computer vision applications. However, fewer superpixel segmentation methods consider automatically determining the number of initial superpixels. Focusing on high-precision and connectivity, we propose a superpixel segmentation algorithm with non-uniform seed initialization. The proposed algorithm can adaptively determine the number and the position of initial seeds, and is robust to the segmentation of small objects and slender regions. First, we propose a seed initialization scheme based on the side of the circumscribed rectangle of the small object and interval boundary gradient. To enhance the regularity of superpixels, we equally added seeds for grids with sparse seed distribution. Second, we construct a weighted distance measure with search region and feature constraints, which reduces the computational complexity and enhances the precision of pixel label assignment. Finally, we quantify the disconnected regions are present in abundance, and propose a post-processing method based on the area of predefined small objects. The proposed method can significantly improve the connectivity and regularity of the generated superpixels. Extensive experiments on the widely-used BSDS and CamVid datasets demonstrate that the non-uniform seed initialization is effective, and the performance of the proposed superpixel segmentation is favorably compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) plays a crucial role in mitigating the inefficiencies of current public transit systems. Efficient routing is paramount for enhancing the flexibility and applicability of this transportation mode. Machine learning techniques, such as the attention-based encoder-decoder methodology, have the capability to produce solutions within seconds after offline training. However, these algorithms encounter convergence issues during training process, and demonstrate limited generalization ability, particularly across different scales. Thus, this paper proposes a graph prompt learning-based method comprising an information encoder, token generation, and token mapping to effectively train models that can adapt to diverse vehicles and demand variations. Particularly, token generation considers the characteristics of the problem by integrating vehicle and customer urgency information each time step. Token mapping obtains vehicle decoding sequences through attention mechanisms and mask function. The proposed model's performance is comprehensively evaluated against commonly baselines across various request contexts. Results show that our method can significantly reduce the computational time, and improve the quality of routing solution compared with baselines. Overall, the proposed model can enhance the routing efficiency of DRT systems through token mapping and prompts design.",

        "abstract": "Accurately locating the question-related regions in one given image is crucial for visual question answering (VQA). The current approaches suffer two limitations: (1) Dividing one image into multiple regions may lose parts of semantic information and original relationships between regions; (2) Choosing only one or all image regions to predict the answer may correspondingly result in the insufficiency or redundancy of information. Therefore, how to effectively mine the relationship between image regions and choose the relevant image regions are vital. In this paper, we propose a novel M ulti-granularity feature interaction and M ulti-region selection-based triplet VQA model (M2TVQA). To tackle the first limitation, we propose the multi-granularity feature interaction strategy that adaptively supplements the global coarse-granularity features with the regional fine-granularity features. To overcome the second limitation, we design the Top- $K$ learning strategy to adaptively select $K$ most relevant image regions to the question, even if the selected regions are far away in space. Such a strategy can select as many relevant image regions as possible and reduce introducing noise. Finally, we construct the multi-modality triplet to predict the answer of VQA. Extended experiments on two public outside knowledge datasets OK-VQA and KRVQA verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Personalized search aims at re-ranking search results with reference to users' background information. The state-of-the-art personalized search methods often consider both the short-term search interests from current session behaviors and the long-term search interests from previous session behaviors. However, sessions in real-world search scenarios are usually very short, and a large number of sessions contain only one query, which makes it difficult to model short-term search interests. Intuitively, apart from current session behaviors, some recent historical session behaviors could also contribute to the current search interests, and the influence of these behaviors typically decays over time. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph based Hawkes process to improve the effectiveness of personalized search. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous graph to model multiple relations between users, queries, and documents. Then, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based algorithm to encode the representations of users' historical search behaviors. After that, we develop a multivariate Hawkes process to capture the influence of historical search behaviors on the current search intent. Our approach can dynamically model the influence of historical behaviors in a continuous time space. Thus, both the current session behaviors and the historical session behaviors can be utilized to characterize a more accurate current search intent. We evaluate our method using three real-life datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several widely-used precision metrics.",

        "abstract": "Answering complex logical queries on large-scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs) efficiently and accurately has always been crucial for question-answering systems. Recent studies have significantly improved the performance of complex logical queries on massive knowledge graphs by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the existing GNN-based methods still have limitations in dealing with long-sequence logical queries. They usually decompose complex queries into multiple independent first-order logical queries, which leads to the inability to optimize globally, and the query accuracy will drop sharply with the increase of query length. In addition, the knowlege in the real world is dynamically changing, but most of the existing methods are more suitable for dealing with static knowledge graphs, and there is still much room for improvement when dealing with logical queries in temporal knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal Complex Logical Query (TCLQ) model to achieve temporal logical queries on temporal knowledge graphs. We add time series embedding into GNN, and use multi-layer GRUs to aggregate the node features of previous time and current time, which effectively enhances the time series reasoning ability of the model. In order to solve the problem that the accuracy of logical query model decreases significantly with the increase of query sequence length, we establish a multi-level attention coefficients model to learn and optimize the whole logical queries, thus reducing the error accumulation problem when the queries are decomposed into multiple independent first-order logical queries. We conduct experiments on multiple temporal datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of TCLQ.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a task of leveraging deep neural networks to enhance the image illumination while keeping the image content unchanged. From the perspective of training data, existing methods complete the LLIE task driven by one of the following three data types: paired data, unpaired data and zero-reference data. Each type of these data-driven methods has its own advantages, e.g., zero-reference data-based methods have very low requirements on training data and can meet the human needs in many scenarios. In this paper, we leverage pure Gaussian noise to complete the LLIE task, which further reduces the requirements for training data in LLIE tasks and can be used as another alternative in practical use. Specifically, we propose Noise SElf-Regression (NoiSER) without access to any task-related data, simply learns a convolutional neural network equipped with an instance-normalization layer by taking a random noise image, $\\mathcal {N}(0,\\sigma ^{2})$ for each pixel, as both input and output for each training pair, and then the low-light image is fed to the trained network for predicting the normal-light image. Technically, an intuitive explanation for its effectiveness is as follows: 1) the self-regression reconstructs the contrast between adjacent pixels of the input image, 2) the instance-normalization layer may naturally remediate the overall magnitude/lighting of the input image, and 3) the $\\mathcal {N}(0,\\sigma ^{2})$ assumption for each pixel enforces the output image to follow the well-known gray-world hypothesis [1] when the image size is big enough. Compared to current state-of-the-art LLIE methods with access to different task-related data, NoiSER is highly competitive in enhancement quality, yet with a much smaller model size, and much lower training and inference cost. In addition, the experiments also demonstrate that NoiSER has great potential in overexposure suppression and joint processing with other restor...",

        "abstract": "Federated learning is a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for distributed machine learning. In this context, there is sometimes a need for a specialized process called machine unlearning, which is required when the effect of some specific training samples needs to be removed from a learning model due to privacy, security, usability, and/or legislative factors. However, problems arise when current centralized unlearning methods are applied to existing federated learning, in which the server aims to remove all information about a class from the global model. Centralized unlearning usually focuses on simple models or is premised on the ability to access all training data at a central node. However, training data cannot be accessed on the server under the federated learning paradigm, conflicting with the requirements of the centralized unlearning process. Additionally, there are high computation and communication costs associated with accessing clients' data, especially in scenarios involving numerous clients or complex global models. To address these concerns, we propose a more effective and efficient federated unlearning scheme based on the concept of model explanation. Model explanation involves understanding deep networks and individual channel importance, so that this understanding can be used to determine which model channels are critical for classes that need to be unlearned. We select the most influential channels within an already-trained model for the data that need to be unlearned and fine-tune only influential channels to remove the contribution made by those data. In this way, we can simultaneously avoid huge consumption costs and ensure that the unlearned model maintains good performance. Experiments with different training models on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Graph data contains rich node features and unique edge information, which have been applied across various domains, such as citation networks or recommendation systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are specialized for handling such data and have shown impressive performance in many applications. However, GNNs may contain of sensitive information and susceptible to privacy attacks. For example, link stealing is a type of attack in which attackers infer whether two nodes are linked or not. Previous link stealing attacks primarily relied on posterior probabilities from the target GNN model, neglecting the significance of node features. Additionally, variations in node classes across different datasets lead to different dimensions of posterior probabilities. The handling of these varying data dimensions posed a challenge in using a single model to effectively conduct link stealing attacks on different datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform link stealing attacks on GNNs. LLMs can effectively integrate textual features and exhibit strong generalizability, enabling attacks to handle diverse data dimensions across various datasets. We design two distinct LLM prompts to effectively combine textual features and posterior probabilities of graph nodes. Through these designed prompts, we fine-tune the LLM to adapt to the link stealing attack task. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LLM using multiple datasets and enable the LLM to learn features from different datasets simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of existing link stealing attack tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Our method can execute link stealing attacks across different datasets using only a single model, making link stealing attacks more applicable to real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation system in location-based social networks is pivotal, offering versatile applications. Personalized recommendations hinge on pre-established user relationships, emphasizing geographic proximity and character similarities. To attain spatial and temporal information, natural language text mining, particularly relation extraction tasks, emerges as crucial, drawing from the abundant textual data on the Internet. However, challenges arise with traditional supervised methods relying on human-annotated data and distant supervision introducing noises, which prickly and seriously degrade the effectiveness of the sentence encoding for valid relation mentions. To address this issue, we aim to rectify the sentence encoder by acquiring external knowledge from an existing fully supervised dataset. More specifically, we craft transfer learning, together with adversarial training, to discover the semantic consistency in the valid relation mentions. During training, the sentence encoder receives data from both domains successively and generates a consistent output for them. While the discriminator distinguishes, as far as possible, which domain these sentences come from. After the above training procedure, the encoder can be made insensitive to the noise in distantly supervised data for denoising purposes. The experimental results on the widely used dataset NYT10 demonstrate that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for relation extraction.",

        "abstract": "Visual analysis has been increasingly integrated into the exploration of temporal networks, as visualization methods have the capability to present time-varying attributes and relationships of entities in an easy-to-read manner. Visualization techniques have been employed in a variety of dynamic network datasets, including social media networks, academic citation networks, and financial transaction networks. However, effectively visualizing dynamic basketball player network data, which consists of numerical networks, intensive timestamps, and subtle changes, remains a challenge for analysts. To address this issue, we propose a snapshot extraction algorithm that involves human-in-the-loop methodology to help users divide a series of networks into hierarchical snapshots for subsequent network analysis tasks, such as node exploration and network pattern analysis. Furthermore, we design and implement a prototype system, called DBNetVizor, for dynamic basketball player network data visualization. DBNetVizor integrates a graphical user interface to help users extract snapshots visually and interactively, as well as multiple linked visualization charts to display macro- and micro-level information of dynamic basketball player network data. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of our proposed methods, we present two case studies based on dynamic basketball player network data in a competition. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation and receive positive feedback.",

        "abstract": "The edge computing paradigm has revolutionized the healthcare sector, providing more real-time medical data processing and analysis, which also poses more serious privacy and security risks that must be carefully considered and addressed. Based on differential privacy, we presented an innovative privacy-preserving model named Edge-DPSDG (Edge-Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generator) for smart healthcare under edge computing. It also develops and evolves a privacy budget allocation mechanism. In a distributed environment, the privacy budget for local medical data is personalized by computing the Shapley value and the information entropy value of each attribute in the dataset, which takes into account the trade-off between data privacy and utility. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets are performed to evaluate the performance of Edge-DPSDG on two metrics. For utility evaluation, Edge-DPSDG shows a best 21.29% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art; our privacy budget allocation mechanism improved existing models' accuracy by up to 6.05%. For privacy evaluation, Edge-DPSDG shows that can effectively ensure the privacy of the original datasets. In addition, Edge-DPSDG helps smooth the data, and results in a 3.99% accuracy loss decrease over the non-private model.",

        "abstract": "Reflection removal is a crucial issue in image reconstruction, especially for high-definition images. Removing undesirable reflections can greatly enhance the performance of various visual systems, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and security surveillance. However, the resolution of existing reflection removal datasets is not high and the training data heavily relies on synthetic data, which hampers the performance of reflection removal methods and restricts the development of effective techniques tailored for high-definition images. Therefore, this paper introduces a new dataset, Real-world Reflection Removal in 4K (RR4K). This novel dataset, with its large capacity and high resolution of 6000Ã4000 pixels, represents a significant advancement in the field, ensuring a realistic and high quality benchmark. Furthermore, building upon the dataset, we propose an efficient method for single-image reflection removal, optimized for high-definition processing. This method employs the U-Net architecture, enhanced with large kernel distillation and scale-aware features, enabling it to effectively handle complex reflection scenarios while reducing computational demands. Comprehensive testing on the RR4K dataset and existing low-resolution datasets has demonstrated the methodâs superior efficiency and effectiveness. We believe that our constructed RR4K dataset can better evaluate and design algorithms for removing undesirable reflection from real-world high-definition images. Our dataset and code are available at GitHubâ .",

        "abstract": "In the era of Industry 5.0, the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to extend its applications to broader human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-machine connectivity. With the increasing number of healthcare groups, there is an urgent need to develop embodied neuromorphic intelligent human-machine connectivity products based on these technologies. However, it remains a critical challenge to address the influencing factors of such product designs and how to quantify interaction efficacy. This study proposes a product framework combining IoT with embodied neuromorphic intelligence and conducts a user study. A cognitive rehabilitation product was developed using Leap Motion technology, with gesture recognition difficulty as a design variable, and product efficacy was quantified using a combination of brain-computer interaction and multi-source interactive feedback. Fifteen elderly and fifteen young participants engaged in puppet control tasks under resting, simple, and complex conditions. The study compared brain activation levels, brain network connectivity, and eight behavioral indicators. The results demonstrated that the difficulty level significantly affects interaction efficacy. This research reveals neurological changes in the rehabilitation process of healthcare groups and opens new directions for the design and efficacy evaluation of embodied neuromorphic intelligence in HCI rehabilitation products through IoT and big data analytics, thereby advancing the development of Healthcare Industry 5.0.",

        "abstract": "The few-shot image classification task is to enable a model to identify novel classes by using only a few labeled samples as references. In general, the more knowledge a model has, the more robust it is when facing novel situations. Although directly introducing large amounts of new training data to acquire more knowledge is an attractive solution, it violates the purpose of few-shot learning with respect to reducing dependence on big data. Another viable option is to enable the model to accumulate knowledge more effectively from existing data, i.e., improve the utilization of existing data. In this article, we propose a new data augmentation method called self-mixup (SM) to assemble different augmented instances of the same image, which facilitates the model to more effectively accumulate knowledge from limited training data. In addition to the utilization of data, few-shot learning faces another challenge related to feature extraction. Specifically, existing metric-based few-shot classification methods rely on comparing the extracted features of the novel classes, but the widely adopted downsampling structures in various networks can lead to feature degradation due to the violation of the sampling theorem, and the degraded features are not conducive to robust classification. To alleviate this problem, we propose a calibration-adaptive downsampling (CADS) that calibrates and utilizes the characteristics of different features, which can facilitate robust feature extraction and benefit classification. By improving data utilization and feature extraction, our method shows superior performance on four widely adopted few-shot classification datasets.",

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL), a variant of Federated Learning (FL), has recently drawn increasing attention as the VFL matches the enterprises' demands of leveraging more valuable features to achieve better model performance. However, conventional VFL methods may run into data deficiency as they exploit only aligned and labeled samples (belonging to different parties), leaving often the majority of unaligned and unlabeled samples unused. The data deficiency hampers the effort of the federation. In this work, we propose a Federated Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning framework, named FedHSSL, that utilizes cross-party views (i.e., dispersed features) of samples aligned among parties and local views (i.e., data augmentation) of unaligned samples within each party to improve the representation learning capability of the VFL joint model. FedHSSL further exploits invariant features across parties to boost the performance of the joint model through partial model aggregation. FedHSSL, as a framework, can work with various representative SSL methods. We empirically demonstrate that FedHSSL methods outperform baselines by large margins. We provide an in-depth analysis of FedHSSL regarding label leakage, which is rarely investigated in existing self-supervised VFL works. The experimental results show that, with proper protection, FedHSSL achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off against the state-of-the-art label inference attack compared with baselines.

        "abstract": "By reconfiguring wireless channels via passive signal reflection, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can bring significant performance enhancement for wireless communication systems. However, such performance improvement generally relies on the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) for IRS-involved links. Prior works on IRS CSI acquisition mainly estimate IRS-cascaded channels based on the extra pilot signals received at the users/base station (BS) with time-varying IRS reflections, which, however, needs to modify the existing channel training/estimation protocols of wireless systems. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new channel estimation scheme for IRS-assisted communication systems based on the received signal power measured at the user terminal, which is practically attainable without the need of changing the current protocol. Due to the lack of signal phase information in measured power, the autocorrelation matrix of the BS-IRS-user cascaded channel is estimated by solving an equivalent rank-minimization problem. To this end, a low-rank-approaching (LRA) algorithm is proposed by employing the fractional programming and alternating optimization techniques. To reduce computational complexity, an approximate LRA (ALRA) algorithm is also developed. Furthermore, these two algorithms are extended to be robust against the receiver noise and quantization error in power measurement. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation algorithms as well as the IRS passive reflection design based on the estimated channel autocorrelation matrix.",

The AFS is used to extract semantics of concepts for fuzzy representation using data distribution. The FCM with memory is trained to model the influence relationships between different semantics of concepts and multiple targets based on multi-dimensional time series data. And a multidimensional learning algorithm of AFS-FCM with memory based on gradient descent is developed to investigate the influences of different semantics of concepts on multiple targets. Finally, we validate our model by comparing with other FCMs, intrinsic interpretable models and machine learning methods for prediction of air quality multidimensional time series data, and discuss the performance of AFS-FCM with different transformation functions. The model can not only predict air quality accurately, but also explicitly reveal the specific quantitative relationship of different semantics of meteorology on air quality",

        "abstract": "The intelligent vehicle manufacturing industry is flourishing, but its large-scale adoption and application require not only ensuring driving safety and high-quality service but also addressing a multitude of data security threats. Among these, authentication and unauthorized access are significant factors hindering its implementation. To ensure the secure communication and operation of intelligent vehicles, we propose an new matchmaking encryption scheme with inner product, which supports bilateral control, as well as authentication with anonymity. As a cornerstone of this paper, we design a secure attribute-based anonymous credential scheme, enabling authentication. Moreover, by introducing the dual-policy of inner product, the authenticating process ensures the vehicle privacy through anonymity. We formalize the definitions of authentication and anonymity and prove that our scheme satisfies these properties. Compared with the most related works, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme provides enhanced security while maintaining comparable computational overhead. Notably, the computational performance in encryption, verification, and decryption processes is impressive. The high efficiency of these processes makes them well-suited for resource-constrained devices in intelligent vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) leverages both video and audio information for model training, aiming to classify new video categories that were not seen during the training. However, existing methods often failed to learn robust multi-modal feature representations because they overlook the importance of object-aware images. Moreover, these methods require complete modal information to operate effectively, which limits their performance in resource-constrained environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Object-Aware Image Augmentation Network (OAIA) for audio-visual ZSL. OAIA introduces a Cross-Modal Feature Augmentation (CMFA) subnet and a Missing Modality Generation (MMG) subnet to enhance feature representations and generate virtual features for missing modalities. Specifically, the CMFA subnet uses attention mechanisms to integrate and enhance the features of video, audio, and object-aware images, providing a richer training signal for the model and promoting the learning of more diverse and discriminative multi-modal representations. The MMG subnet employs a multi-layer perceptron to generate virtual features for missing modalities based on existing modal information, ensuring that the model can operate effectively even when modal data is incomplete during testing. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "To improve the accuracy and time efficiency of medical brain image segmentation, we propose a deformable registration network EDUNet in the registration stage of multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) of brain images. We perform data preprocessing on the floating and fixed images to minimize external influences. In the registration stage, we use ANTs instead of traditional âcoarseâ registration, and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve âfineâ registration, estimate the deformation field, and introduce an attention mechanism and a dilated convolution module. We propose a deep learning based multimodal cross-reconstruction inverted pyramid network MCRAIP-Net, which uses multimodal magnetic resonance images as input, extracts features of each modality through three independent encoder structures, and fuses the extracted features at the same resolution level. We use a dual-channel cross-reconstruction attention module to refine and fuse multimodal features. On this basis, we use an inverted pyramid decoder to integrate the features of different resolutions at each stage of the decoder, and complete the task of brain tissue segmentation. We compare the segmentation results of two datasets, and show that the proposed algorithm has simpler interaction and faster speed than the confidence connected algorithm, and also greatly improves the segmentation performance. On the Synapse dataset, we use 18 samples as training sets and 12 samples as testing sets; 5 On the ACDC dataset, we use 70 samples as training set, 10 samples as validation set, and 20 samples as testing set. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional U-Net network and other existing models, our model has better accuracy and feasibility in rib fracture segmentation.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of big data technology, deep learning automatic modulation recognition (DLAMR) has undergone new improvements. Existing DLAMR methods focus mostly on the primary matching of the model itself or ubiquitous big communications data, which lack interpretability and ignore deep representations for the modulation mechanism of the communication signals; thus, difficulties in further improving the recognition accuracy and multiquadrant amplitude modulation (MQAM) discriminability in complex communication environments are encountered. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative communication signal graph mapping method to address the uncertainty in the modulation mechanisms. Specifically, it models sampling points as nodes; connects inter- and intra-symbol points with edges to represent modulation mechanisms and propagation uncertainty; and maps amplitude, phase, in-phase, and quadrature values as node features. A deep graphical and temporal neuro-fuzzy methodology (GT-DNFS) that integrates graph attention networks and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks is subsequently proposed for DLAMR. The numerical results show that GT-DNFS achieves a significantly higher recognition accuracy of 93.01%, and an MQAM (M=16, 64) discrimination of 94.5%. This research offers valuable insights for neuro-fuzzy networks and efficient DLAMR algorithm design.",

        "abstract": "In healthcare, training examples are usually hard to obtain (e.g., cases of a rare disease), or the cost of labelling data is high. With a large number of features ( $p$ ) be measured in a relatively small number of samples ( $N$ ), the âbig $p$ , small $N$ â problem is an important subject in healthcare studies, especially on the genomic data. Another major challenge of effectively analyzing medical data is the skewed class distribution caused by the imbalance between different class labels. In addition, feature importance and interpretability play a crucial role in the success of solving medical problems. Therefore, in this paper, we present an interpretable deep embedding model (IDEM) to classify new data having seen only a few training examples with highly skewed class distribution. IDEM model consists of a feature attention layer to learn the informative features, a feature embedding layer to directly deal with both numerical and categorical features, a siamese network with contrastive loss to compare the similarity between learned embeddings of two input samples. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world medical data demonstrate that our IDEM model has better generalization power than conventional approaches with few and imbalanced training medical samples, and it is able to identify which features contribute to the classifier in distinguishing case and control.",

        "abstract": "Temporal graph learning aims to generate high-quality representations for graph-based tasks with dynamic information, which has recently garnered increasing attention. In contrast to static graphs, temporal graphs are typically organized as node interaction sequences over continuous time rather than an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model current interactions by incorporating historical neighborhood. However, such methods only consider first-order temporal information while disregarding crucial high-order structural information, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised method called S2T for temporal graph learning, which extracts both temporal and structural information to learn more informative node representations. Notably, the initial node representations combine first-order temporal and high-order structural information differently to calculate two conditional intensities. An alignment loss is then introduced to optimize the node representations, narrowing the gap between the two intensities and making them more informative. Concretely, in addition to modeling temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider structural knowledge at both local and global levels. At the local level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) requires vision models to quickly adapt to brand-new classification tasks with changing task distributions in the presence of limited annotated samples. However, the learned model is susceptible to overfitting and may fail to identify effective classification boundaries due to the biased distribution resulting from a limited number of training samples. Moreover, if the support samples from different classes in the new task are in close proximity, this may lead to fuzzy or even biased class decision boundaries. To address the issues, we propose a generation-based Feature Transductive Distribution Optimization (FTDO) in our research. Specifically, we calibrate the distribution of novel classes by utilizing high-confidence unlabeled query samples from these novel classes, together with the statistics of similar base classes, to generate a sufficient number of virtual training samples. In addition, we introduce a task commonality removal and discriminability enhancement module, which eliminates commonality from all features in the task along the task-commonality direction, and reinforces the retained discriminative features through a channel transformation function. Our method can be implemented using off-the-shelf pre-trained feature extractors and classification models, without requiring additional parameters. Experiments conducted on four few-shot classification datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Recently domain adaptation methods based on contrastive learning are widely used to solve the cross-scene classification problem. However, existing contrastive learning methods only focus on source domain or target domain features, or do not adequately consider the interaction of domain information, thus the learned domain-invariant features still have large discrepancies. To address this problem, we propose a novel domain fusion contrastive learning (DFCL) framework for cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. DFCL employs an inter-domain, intra-domain dual domain fusion strategy at the feature level, which introduces domain information as a noise interference term for sample enhancement. With the interference of domain information, same category samples are pulled closer and different categories samples are pushed further apart to learn more discriminative features. In addition, we construct an intermediate domain through the source and target domains and define a feature space loss that measures domain discrepancy by feature similarity and label similarity. Finally, a progressive selection strategy based on prototype learning is proposed to select high-confidence pseudo-labels for domain fusion contrastive learning. Experiments on three HSI cross-scene datasets show that the proposed method is superior to existing domain adaptation methods.",

        "abstract": "The diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. The primary method of identifying LNM is to perform frozen sections and pathologic analysis, but this method is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, combining intraoperative fluorescence imaging with deep learning (DL) methods can improve efficiency. The majority of recent studies only analyze uni-modal fluorescence imaging, which provides less semantic information. In this work, we mainly established a multi-modal fluorescence imaging feature fusion prediction (MFI-FFP) model combining white light, fluorescence, and pseudo-color imaging of lymph nodes for LNM prediction. Firstly, based on the properties of various modal imaging, distinct feature extraction networks are chosen for feature extraction, which could significantly enhance the complementarity of various modal information. Secondly, the multi-modal feature fusion (MFF) module, which combines global and local information, is designed to fuse the extracted features. Furthermore, a novel loss function is formulated to tackle the issue of imbalanced samples, challenges in differentiating samples, and enhancing sample variety. Lastly, the experiments show that the model has a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), and F1 score than the uni-modal and bi-modal models and has a better performance compared to other efficient image classification networks. Our study demonstrates that the MFI-FFP model has the potential to help doctors predict LNM and shows its promise in medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "The recent advent of in-context learning (ICL) capabilities in large pre-trained models has yielded significant advancements in the generalization of segmentation models. By supplying domain-specific image-mask pairs, the ICL model can be effectively guided to produce optimal segmentation outcomes, eliminating the necessity for model fine-tuning or interactive prompting. However, current existing ICL-based segmentation models exhibit significant limitations when applied to medical segmentation datasets with substantial diversity. To address this issue, we propose a dual similarity checkup approach to guarantee the effectiveness of selected in-context samples so that their guidance can be maximally leveraged during inference. We first employ large pre-trained vision models for extracting strong semantic representations from input images and constructing a feature embedding memory bank for semantic similarity checkup during inference. Assuring the similarity in the input semantic space, we then minimize the discrepancy in the mask appearance distribution between the support set and the estimated mask appearance prior through similarity-weighted sampling and augmentation. We validate our proposed dual similarity checkup approach on eight publicly available medical segmentation datasets, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the performance metrics of existing ICL-based segmentation models, particularly when applied to medical image datasets characterized by substantial diversity.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel privacy-preserving multilayer community detection framework based on federated learning which is called federated multilayer community detection (FMCD). First, we propose a novel aggregation strategy by utilizing the network average degree of local networks to aggregate the parameters uploaded by clients in the step of aggregation, which can improve the performance of community detection. Second, we design a training procedure to complete multilayer community detection in multiorganizations, which can reduce communication overhead by transmitting merged community information instead of the global parameter. Finally, experiment results on synthetic and real networks with different criteria illustrate that FMCD can achieve significant performance gains, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Conversational emotion recognition (CER) is an important research topic in human-computer interactions. Although recent advancements in transformer-based cross-modal fusion methods have shown promise in CER tasks, they tend to overlook the crucial intra-modal and inter-modal emotional interaction or suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we introduce a novel and lightweight cross-modal feature fusion method called Low-Rank Matching Attention Method (LMAM). LMAM effectively captures contextual emotional semantic information in conversations while mitigating the quadratic complexity issue caused by the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, by setting a matching weight and calculating inter-modal features attention scores row by row, LMAM requires only one-third of the parameters of self-attention methods. We also employ the low-rank decomposition method on the weights to further reduce the number of parameters in LMAM. As a result, LMAM offers a lightweight model while avoiding overfitting problems caused by a large number of parameters. Moreover, LMAM is able to fully exploit the intra-modal emotional contextual information within each modality and integrates complementary emotional semantic information across modalities by computing and fusing similarities of intra-modal and inter-modal features simultaneously. Experimental results verify the superiority of LMAM compared with other popular cross-modal fusion methods on the premise of being more lightweight. Also, LMAM can be embedded into any existing state-of-the-art CER methods in a plug-and-play manner, and can be applied to other multi-modal recognition tasks, e.g., session recommendation and humour detection, demonstrating its remarkable generalization ability.",

        "abstract": "Uplink sensing in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, such as Perceptive Mobile Networks, is challenging due to the clock asynchronism between transmitter and receiver. Existing solutions typically require the presence of a line-of-sight path and the knowledge of the transmitterâs location. In this paper, these requirements, we propose a novel uplink sensing scheme to relieve these requirements by introducing static anchor points for the first time. The scheme consists of two efficient algorithms. The first algorithm estimates the relative timing and carrier frequency offsets, with respect to a randomly selected reference snapshot. Its estimation performance is analyzed with closed-form bias and root mean squared error derived. The estimates from the first algorithm are then used to eliminate clock offsets, enabling the construction of angle-Doppler maps. Using the maps, the second algorithm is developed to identify anchor points and then locate the transmitter and dynamic targets. The impact of the locations of the transmitter and anchor points is also analytically illustrated. Extensive simulation results are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed sensing scheme in practical 5G communication setups and its superiority over prior art in terms of noise resilience and asymptotic performances.",

        "abstract": "CT-based bronchial tree analysis is a key step for the diagnosis of lung and airway diseases. However, the topology of bronchial trees varies across individuals, which presents a challenge to the automatic bronchus classification. To solve this issue, we propose the Bronchus Classification Network (BCNet), a structure-guided framework that exploits the segment-level topological information using point clouds to learn the voxel-level features. BCNet has two branches, a Point-Voxel Graph Neural Network (PV-GNN) for segment classification, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for voxel labeling. The two branches are simultaneously trained to learn topology-aware features for their shared backbone while it is feasible to run only the CNN branch for the inference. Therefore, BCNet maintains the same inference efficiency as its CNN baseline. Experimental results show that BCNet significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art methods by over 8.0% both on F1-score for classifying bronchus. Furthermore, we contribute BronAtlas: an open-access benchmark of bronchus imaging analysis with high-quality voxel-wise annotations of both anatomical and abnormal bronchial segments. The benchmark is available at link 1 .",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has long had great success in advancing the field of annotation-efficient learning. However, when applied to CT volume segmentation, most SSL methods suffer from two limitations, including rarely using the information acquired by different imaging modalities and providing supervision only to the bottleneck encoder layer. To address both limitations, we design a pretext task to align the information in each 3D CT volume and the corresponding 2D generated X-ray image and extend self-distillation to deep self-distillation. Thus, we propose a self-supervised learner based on Cross-modal Alignment and Deep Self-distillation (CADS) to improve the encoderâs ability to characterize CT volumes. The cross-modal alignment is a more challenging pretext task that forces the encoder to learn better image representation ability. Deep self-distillation provides supervision to not only the bottleneck layer but also shallow layers, thus boosting the abilities of both. Comparative experiments show that, during pre-training, our CADS has lower computational complexity and GPU memory cost than competing SSL methods. Based on the pre-trained encoder, we construct PVT-UNet for 3D CT volume segmentation. Our results on seven downstream tasks indicate that PVT-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods like MOCOv3 and DiRA, as well as prevalent medical image segmentation methods like nnUNet and CoTr. Code and pre-trained weight will be available at https://github.com/yeerwen/CADS.",

        "abstract": "Interpretability of neural networks (NNs) and their underlying theoretical behavior remain an open field of study even after the great success of their practical applications, particularly with the emergence of deep learning. In this work, NN2Poly is proposed: a theoretical approach to obtain an explicit polynomial model that provides an accurate representation of an already trained fully connected feed-forward artificial NN a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach extends a previous idea proposed in the literature, which was limited to single hidden layer networks, to work with arbitrarily deep MLPs in both regression and classification tasks. NN2Poly uses a Taylor expansion on the activation function, at each layer, and then applies several combinatorial properties to calculate the coefficients of the desired polynomials. Discussion is presented on the main computational challenges of this method, and the way to overcome them by imposing certain constraints during the training phase. Finally, simulation experiments as well as applications to real tabular datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Actual image super-resolution is an extremely challenging task due to complex degradations existing in the image. To solve this problem, two dominant methodologies have emerged: degradation-estimation-based Addressing actual image super-resolution remains a formidable challenge due to the intricate degradations present in images. Two primary methodologies have emerged: degradation-estimation-based and blind-based methods. The former often struggle to accurately estimate degradation, limiting their effectiveness on real low-resolution images. Conversely, blind-based methods rely on a single perceptual perspective, constraining their adaptability to diverse perceptual characteristics. In response to these challenges, we present MPF-Net, a novel super-resolution approach aimed at enhancing real-world image super-resolution tasks by enabling the model to learn multiple perceptual features from input images. Our method features a Multi-Perception Feature Extraction module (MPFE) designed to extract diverse perceptual details, complemented by Cross-Perception Blocks (CPB) facilitating the fusion of this information for efficient super-resolution reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive regularization term (CR) to enhance the modelâs learning by leveraging newly generated HR and LR images as positive and negative samples. Experimental results on challenging real-world SR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "abstract": "GIFT, as a lightweight block cipher algorithm, is mainly suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as the Internet of Things, to achieve efficient cryptographic communication. For the diffusion characteristics of round function of GIFT algorithm, this paper proposes two byte-based differential fault attack models. Theoretically, the first and second models require 53.44 and 12.42 byte faults to recover the master key. Experimental results show that the first and second models require about 79 and 16 byte faults, respectively, to recover the master key. The models proposed in this paper have made significant breakthroughs in terms of both the attack range and the number of required faults, which provide important guidance for algorithmic security research and the design of fault-tolerant mechanisms for IoT devices.",

        "abstract": "Paper-reviewer recommendation is an effective method to match reviewers for papers in peer review. However, existing recommendation methods are either sensitive to the order of paper process or not excepted fair in total. How to efficiently and accurately recommend is still a tough task and needs to be further explored. Thus, in this paper, we propose a greedy-version automatic paper-reviewer recommendation algorithm regarding both aspects of depth and breadth, named as GMCTS. More specifically, from the depth aspect, we focus on the maximum weight matching between paper and reviewer for each recommendation. While from the breadth aspect, we consider the broadest of distinctive topics (expertise) covered by the recommended reviewers. Furthermore, to avoid the unfairness of recommendation, we consider three types of constraints both theoretically and experimentally, including paper demand constraint, reviewer workload constraint and multiple types of Conflict Of Interests (COIs). Finally, extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GMCTS achieves an impressive performance. Specifically, GMCTS scores a 90.5% and 12.67% gain in topic coverage and recall respectively compared to some advanced recommendation methods.",

        "abstract": "Computational effectiveness and limited resources in evolutionary algorithms are interdependently handled during the working of low-power microprocessors for real-world problems, particularly in many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs). In this respect, the balance between them will be broken by evolutionary algorithms with a normal-sized population, but which doesn't include a micro population. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a micro many-objective evolutionary algorithm with knowledge transfer ( $\\mu$ MaOEA). To address the oversight that knowledge is often not considered enough between niches, the knowledge-transfer strategy is proposed to bolster each unoptimized niche through optimizing adjacent niches, which enables niches to generate better individuals. Meanwhile, a two-stage mechanism based on fuzzy logic is designed to settle the conflict between convergence and diversity in many-objective optimization problems. Through efficient fuzzy logic decision-making, the mechanism maintains different properties of the population at different stages. Different MaOEAs and micro multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were compared on benchmark test problems DTLZ, MaF, and WFG, and the results showed that $\\mu$ MaOEA has an excellent performance. In addition, it also conducted simulation on two real-world problems, MPDMP and MLDMP, based on a low-power microprocessor. The results indicated the applicability of $\\mu$ MaOEA for low-power microprocessor optimization.",

        "abstract": "Complex evidence theory (CET), an extension of the traditional D-S evidence theory, has garnered academic interest for its capacity to articulate uncertainty through complex basic belief assignment (CBBA) and to perform uncertainty reasoning using complex combination rules. Nonetheless, quantifying uncertainty within CET remains a subject of ongoing research. To enhance decision making, a method for complex pignistic belief transformation (CPBT) has been introduced, which allocates CBBAs of multielement focal elements to subsets. CPBTâs core lies in the fractal-inspired redistribution of the complex mass function. This article presents an experimental simulation and analysis of CPBTâs generation process along the temporal dimension, rooted in fractal theory. Subsequently, a novel fractal-based complex belief (FCB) entropy is proposed to gauge the uncertainty of CBBA. The properties of FCB entropy are examined, and its efficacy is demonstrated through various numerical examples and practical application.",

        "abstract": "With increasing emphasis on vehicular automation and traffic efficiency, the management and coordination of platoon-based systems have become important. This research introduces a unique control framework based on a behavioral stability strategy, designed to enhance the cohesion of vehicle platoons and improve their ability to resist disturbances. Our approach integrates a vehicle scheduling system with a real-time platoon control mechanism to enhance the behavioral stability, robustness, and safety of the platoon. Given the heterogeneous nature of vehicles, we propose an optimal platoon formation model. This model strategically determines the number of platoons, arranges the sequence of vehicles within each platoon, and selects optimal cruising speeds to maximize platoon cohesion. To further enhance system robustness, a centralized robust model predictive controller is deployed for each platoon, ensuring stability against stochastic perturbations in vehicle dynamics and guaranteeing platoon safety. Finally, we conduct a simulation study involving multiple platoons with 20 heterogeneous vehicles to validate the effectiveness of the multi-layer optimization model.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a microscopic right-of-way trading mechanism (Micro-ROWTM) is developed to encourage cooperative behavior in mixed traffic, which consists of cooperative vehicles (CoVs) and non-cooperative vehicles (NCoVs). Micro-ROWTM encompasses the following functions: (i) detection of traffic conflicts and system-improving opportunities; (ii) participants reporting their attributes; (iii) right-of-way trade proposed by the system; and (iv) trade settlement and cooperative control. In the experiments, the proposed mechanism is tested using an illustrative ramp-merging example, in which each right-of-way trade proposal is offered to a group of participants comprised of a mainline leader, a mainline follower, and a ramp vehicle. Upon the acceptance of a proposal, the mainline leader and/or mainline follower agrees to behave cooperatively (yield) to the ramp vehicle, and receive monetary compensation from the ramp vehicle in return. To help design the trading mechanism, six important definitions are introduced and discussed, including (i) strong individual rationality, (ii) system efficiency and group efficiency, (iii) dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, (iv) social welfare maximization, (v) utilitarian envy minimization and (vi) payoff difference minimization. A linear programming-based trading and taxation model which satisfies the above definitions is then developed and solved. Using the Micro-ROWTM, when the flow rate is 1000veh/h for both the mainline and ramp traffic, the ramp vehicles can save 6.8% travel time and 27.4% fuel consumption on average, and the mainline vehicles can eventually obtain a positive payoff by compensation. From a system perspective, the ramp-merging section can save 107.5s of travel time and 2450.3g of fuel consumption per hour.",

        "abstract": "The increasing use of wireless sensor networks necessitates rapid detection and mitigation of system anomalies and state changes, which can be achieved through change point detection (CPD) methods. This paper introduces a novel approach to detect change points in wireless sensor networks, employing an integrated multimodal method that combines three innovative feature extraction models and a learnable weighted fusion layer for evidence synthesis. Leveraging subjective logic and Dempster-Shafer theory with multivariate time series deep learning, the proposed approach establishes a prior probability distribution informed by subjective logistic loss, thus enhancing decision-making reliability by quantifying uncertainty. To address sample imbalance, this study integrates subjective logistic loss with a sample size parameter and introduces a Kullback.Leibler loss to prevent overconfident errors. A novel semi-supervised training model employing self-distillation and a multi-model Kullback.Leibler loss is also proposed, which significantly improves accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive experiments validate the method, with accuracy improvements of up to 97.79% and 99.69% on various datasets, setting a new benchmark for CPD performance and demonstrating the methodfs potential for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Crowd localization aims to predict the positions of humans in images of crowded scenes. While existing methods have made significant progress, two primary challenges remain: (i) a fixed number of evenly distributed anchors can cause excessive or insufficient predictions across regions in an image with varying crowd densities, and (ii) ranking inconsistency of predictions between the testing and training phases leads to the model being sub-optimal in inference. To address these issues, we propose a Consistency-Aware Anchor Pyramid Network (CAAPN) comprising two key components: an Adaptive Anchor Generator (AAG) and a Localizer with Augmented Matching (LAM). The AAG module adaptively generates anchors based on estimated crowd density in local regions to alleviate the anchor deficiency or excess problem. It also considers the spatial distribution prior to heads for better performance. The LAM module is designed to augment the predictions which are used to optimize the neural network during training by introducing an extra set of target candidates and correctly matching them to the ground truth. The proposed method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches on five challenging datasets: ShanghaiTech A and B, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++, and NWPU-Crowd.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) promotes target learning via a single-directional transfer from label-rich source domain to unlabeled target, while its reverse adaption from target to source has not been jointly considered yet. In real teaching practice, a teacher helps students learn and also gets promotion from students, and such a virtuous cycle inspires us to explore dual-directional transfer between domains. In fact, target pseudo-labels predicted by source commonly involve noise due to model bias; moreover, source domain usually contains innate noise, which inevitably aggravates target noise, leading to noise amplification. Transfer from target to source exploits target knowledge to rectify the adaptation, consequently enables better source transfer, and exploits a virtuous transfer circle. To this end, we propose a dual-correctionâadaptation network (DualCAN), in which adaptation and correction cycle between domains, such that learning in both domains can be boosted gradually. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first naive attempt of dual-directional adaptation. Empirical results validate DualCAN with remarkable performance gains, particularly for extreme noisy tasks (e.g., approximately $+$ 10 $\\%$ on $D$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ of Office-31 with 40 $\\%$ label corruption).",

        "abstract": "This paper explores two novel compressed sensing (CS) strategies for estimating the directions of incoming signals in a coherent environment using a lens antenna array (LAA). Compared to the subspace-based algorithm family, CS techniques, such as the conventional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), can effectively address the direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation without prior knowledge about the number of signals at low complexity. However, they are sensitive to noise and can be adversely affected by multipath distortion. To overcome these limitations, we leverage the energy-concentrating property of an LAA and introduce the signal covariance matrix-based OMP (SCM-OMP) method. This method enhances the accuracy of angular estimation, even in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, by analyzing the definition of mutual coherence (MC), we demonstrate that the SCM-OMP scheme achieves improved performance with a large number of antennas. We then propose the multiple sub-covariance matrices-based OMP (MSCM-OMP) to reduce computational complexity. We also analyze the exact recovery conditions of the studied OMP algorithms and utilize the noise reduction property to show that our proposed SCM-OMP and MSCM-OMP algorithms have better successful recovery probabilities than the OMP scheme. Moreover, we combine the Rife method with two proposed CS-based algorithms to overcome the off-grid effect. Simulation results confirm that the SCM- and MSCM-OMP schemes out-perform other high-resolution DoA estimation methods in both on-grid and off-grid scenarios. Furthermore, the MSCM-OMP method can achieve a detection accuracy of higher than 60%, even in a low-SNR regime, i.e., SNR = â10 dB.",

        "abstract": "To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Extensive analysis and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has been significantly advancing the field of image deblurring. However, existing deep learning models usually rely on overloaded large kernel convolutions or overweighted attention modules. This leads to a heavy computational burden and restricts real applications. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight deblurring network, termed RGE-Net. Our RGE-Net possesses two novel features: 1) We propose a recurrent path into the convolutions to ensure each kernel weight can learn better and stronger feature information, thus increasing the parameter efficiency and reducing the parameters. Furthermore, we propose gated attention to suppress incorrect features flowing in the recurrent path, thus improving performance. 2) We decouple the kernels into spatial and channel components to reduce learning difficulty by reducing parameters and then perform an attention mechanism to obtain significant performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of RGE-Net over state-of-the-art deblurring models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) represents a novel approach within swarm intelligence optimization, introduced in recent years. Renowned for its minimal control parameters and straightforward implementation, the SSA algorithm has swiftly emerged as one of the most proficient and attractive optimization methodologies. Despite its significant accuracy in solutions and rapid convergence, the SSA is hampered by its underperformance in tackling intricate optimization challenges and an imbalanced distribution between exploration and exploitation capabilities. Consequently, this paper proposes a dynamic two-factor sparrow search algorithm based on an enhanced differential evolution operator (DSSADE). Initially, to harmonize both the global and local search capabilities and enhance the convergence speed of the SSA algorithm, a dynamic two-factor mode is put forward. Subsequently, a tolerance mechanism is devised to gauge the algorithm's likelihood of gravitating towards local optima. Furthermore, an embedded enhanced differential evolution operator (EDE) fortifies the SSA's capacity to escape local optima. Notably, experimental results obtained from both classical and CEC2017 benchmark functions exhibit substantial confirmation and endorse the superior efficacy of DSSADE compared to various SSA variants and other cutting-edge swarm intelligent algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The concept of Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) represents a powerful model within the Internet of Things. It perceives different phenomena in the urban environment by taking advantage of the mobility of individuals and the sensors embedded in smartphones. Existing MCS task allocation systems typically assume that workers are in an idle state without any current tasks. However, this overlooks workers who are already engaged in other tasks but are closer to the task location, leading to potential resource wastage. In this paper, we refer to such workers as \"the latent workers\". To address this issue, we propose a novel model called the Constrained Many-Objective Mobile Crowd Sensing Task Allocation Model Considering Latent Workers (CMaO-MCSTA-LW). This model aims to find a set of compromise solutions under multiple uncontrollable objective environments. To effectively solve this model, we developed a new algorithm called the dual-Population Constrained Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Easing Strategy and Elite Parent Strategy (dCMaOEA-E-P), which builds upon the original dCMaOEA-RAE. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several other representative algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows superior performance across multiple perspectives, significantly improving task allocation efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In this letter, we propose using the conical conformal array antenna to launch the steering electromagnetic OAM vortex waves. Firstly, the theoretical calculation method for generating the steering OAM beams using conical array antenna is deduced and the formula of compensated phase shift for each antenna unit located in the conical array is derived. In addition, a polarization correction approach is proposed to achieve better radiation characteristics of the OAM vortex beam. Next, a prototype of a conical conformal array antenna, which consists of 114 U-slot microstrip patch antennas, is fabricated and experimentally verified. The measured results indicate that using the conical array antenna to launch steering OAM vortex beams directing at the elevation angle of 0Â° to 60Â° can prevent significant distortion and guarantee high mode purity even though the scanning angle becomes large. This could serve as a reference for potential future applications of electromagnetic vortex communication on a conformal carrier.",

        "abstract": "Drug discovery is an expensive and risky process. To combat the challenges in drug discovery, an increasing number of researchers and pharmaceutical companies recognize the benefits of utilizing computational techniques. Evolutionary computation (EC) offers promise as most drug discovery problems are essentially complex optimization problems beyond conventional optimization algorithms. EC methods have been widely applied to solve these complex optimization problems especially in lead com-pound generation and molecular virtual evaluation, substantially speeding up the process of drug discovery and development. This article presents a comprehensive survey of EC-based drug discovery methods. Particularly, a new taxonomy of the methods is provided and the advantages and limitations of the methods are reviewed. In addition, the potential future directions of EC-based drug discovery are discussed and the publicly available resources including databases and computational tools are compiled for the convenience of researchers seeking to pursue this field.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a safe reinforcement learning algorithm for the zero-sum game (ZSG) problem of hypersonic flight vehicles within the actor-critic-disturbance framework. Initially, a system transformation on the basis of barrier-function is suggested in which an original safe control issue with full-state constraints is transformed into an equivalent unconstrained optimization problem. Then, an actor-critic-disturbance structure for adaptive optimal learning is proposed to solve the ZSG issue online while assuring safety and stability. Furthermore, based on experience replay technique, novel learning rules for network weights are presented, which not only enable the convergence process of network weights to be more stable, but also accelerate the convergence speed. Thereafter, the stability of the closed-loop system and uniform ultimate boundedness of weight estimation errors are demonstrated by the Lyapunov method. Ultimately, a simulation example is executed to verify the efficiency of the suggested safe reinforcement learning algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The functionality of a battery, including its charge and discharge efficiency, power and energy capacity, gradually decreases as its state of health (SOH) declines. Neglecting the functionality degradation of battery can result in an overestimation of the profitability of a battery swapping station (BSS). To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose a life-cycle decision model for BSS that considers the varying degrees of functionality degradation caused by heterogeneous batteries with different SOH levels. We apply the decision model to energy and transportation applications involving energy arbitrage, ancillary services, and battery swapping services for electric vehicles. Based on the electricity price scenarios in California, we reveal that in the annual operation of BSS, not considering battery functionality degradation can lead to a revenue deviation of 8%, while neglecting battery heterogeneity can lead to an average revenue deviation of 32%. Furthermore, we evaluate the long-term profitability of BSS with different business modes. The proposed model is expected to provide decision support for BSS operators to decide whether to use, how much to use, and which batteries to use, thereby achieving the tradeoff of battery use between energy and transportation sectors.",

        "abstract": "In-memory cache systems such as Redis provide low-latency and high-performance data access for modern internet services. However, in large-scale Redis systems, the workloads show strong skewness and varied locality, which degrades system performance and incurs low CPU utilization. Though there are many approaches toward load imbalance, the two-layered architecture of Redis makes its workload skewness show special characteristics. Redis first maps data into data groups, which is called Group Mapping . Then the data groups are distributed to instances by Instance Mapping . Under Redisâs layered architecture, it gives rise to a small number of hot-spot instances with very limited hot data groups, as well as a large number of remaining cold instances. To improve Redisâs performance and CPU utilization, it entails the accurate identification of instance and data group hotness, and handling hot data groups and cold instances. We propose HPUCache+ to address the hot-spot problem via hotness identification, hot data copying, and cold instance merging. HPUCache+ accurately and dynamically detects instance and data group hotness based on multiple resources and workload characteristics at low cost. It enables access to multiple data copies by dynamically updating the cached mapping in Redis client, achieving high user access performance with Redis client compatibility, while providing highly self-definable service level agreement. It also proposes an asynchronous instance merging strategy based on disk snapshots and temporal caches, which separates the massive data movement from the critical user access path to achieve high-performance instance merging. We implement HPUCache+ into Redis. Experiments show that, compared to the native Redis design, HPUCache+ achieves up to 2.3Ã and 3.5Ã throughput gains, 11.3Ã and 14.3Ã CPU utilization gains, respectively. It also achieves up to 50% less CPU and 75% less memory consumption compared to the state-of-the-art approach Anna.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the success of transformers in natural language processing, vision transformers have been proposed to address a wide range of computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation, and they have achieved very promising performance. However, the robustness of vision transformers has been relatively under-explored. Recent studies have revealed that pre-trained vision transformers are also vulnerable to white-box adversarial attacks on the downstream image classification tasks. The adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM and PGD) designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also cause severe performance drop for vision transformers. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of vision transformers fine-tuned with the off-the-shelf methods under adversarial attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and further propose a data-augmented virtual adversarial training approach called MixVAT, which is able to enhance the robustness of pre-trained vision transformers against adversarial attacks on the downstream tasks with the unlabelled data. Extensive results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over baselines on adversarial robustness, without compromising generalization ability of the model.",

        "abstract": "When capturing images under strong light sources at night, intense lens flare artifacts often appear, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting downstream computer vision tasks. Although transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable results in nighttime flare removal, they fail to adequately distinguish between flare and non-flare regions. This unified processing overlooks the unique characteristics of these regions, leading to suboptimal performance and unsatisfactory results in real-world scenarios. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel approach incorporating Location Prior Guidance (LPG) and a specialized flare removal model, LPFSformer. LPG is designed to accurately learn the location of flares within an image and effectively capture the associated glow effects. By employing Location Prior Injection (LPI), our method directs the modelâs focus towards flare regions through the interaction of frequency and spatial domains. Additionally, to enhance the recovery of high-frequency textures and capture finer local details, we designed a Global Hybrid Feature Compensator (GHFC). GHFC aggregates different expert structures, leveraging the diverse receptive fields and CNN operations of each expert to effectively utilize a broader range of features during the flare removal process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LPFSformer achieves state-of-the-art flare removal performance compared to existing methods. Our code and a pre-trained LPFSformer have been uploaded to GitHub for validation.",

        "abstract": "Audio and visual signals complement each other in human speech perception, and the same applies to automatic speech recognition. The visual signal is less evident than the acoustic signal, but more robust in a complex acoustic environment, as far as speech perception is concerned. It remains a challenge how we effectively exploit the interaction between audio and visual signals for automatic speech recognition. There have been studies using visual signals as redundant or complementary information to audio input in a synchronous manner. However, human studies suggest another mechanism that visual signal primes the listener in advance, indicating when and which frequency to attend to. To simulate such a visual cueing mechanism, we propose a Predict-and-Update Network (P&U net) for Audio- Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). In particular, we first predict the character posteriors of the spoken words, i.e. the visual embedding, based on the visual signal. The audio signal is then conditioned on the visual embedding via a novel cross-modal Conformer, that updates the character posteriors. We validate the effectiveness of the visual cueing mechanism through extensive experiments. The proposed P&U net outperforms the state-of-theart AVSR methods on both LRS2-BBC and LRS3-BBC datasets, with the relative Word Error Rate (WER) reductions exceeding 10% and 40% under clean and noisy conditions, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores new frontiers in agricultural natural language processing (NLP) by investigating the effectiveness of food-related text corpora for pretraining transformer-based language models. Specifically, we focus on semantic matching, establishing mappings between food descriptions and nutrition data through fine-tuning AgriBERT with the FoodOn ontology. Our work introduces an expanded comparison with state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-4, Mistral-large, Claude 3 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.0 Ultra. This exploratory investigation, rather than a direct comparison, aims to understand how AgriBERT, a domain-specific, fine-tuned, open-source model, complements the broad knowledge and generative abilities of these advanced LLMs in addressing the unique challenges of the agricultural sector. We also experiment with other applications, such as cuisine prediction from ingredients, expanding our research to include various NLP tasks beyond semantic matching. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of integrating domain-specific models like AgriBERT with advanced LLMs to enhance the performance and applicability of agricultural NLP applications.",

        "abstract": "In reversible data hiding (RDH) in the plaintext domain, the reversibility of the data and the image is the greatest strength but also comes with limitations, such as low embedding capacity and weak generalization ability. These limitations make it challenging for RDH to be applied in scenarios that require the concealment of high-capacity data. To address these issues, we propose a compatible reversible data hiding with high capacity and generalization (CRDH), which can perform a second embedding based on all existing RDH methods and the two extractions are independent of each other. The nearest-neighbor interpolation (NNI) algorithm and integer wavelet transform are initially designed to create additional redundancy room, diverging from existing RDH methods that typically exploit the inherent redundancy within the image itself. Following this, we derive a novel method to prevent pixel value overflow or underflow, which is employed to guide the data embedding process. In the experimental results on standard test images, the average maximum embedding capacity of the CRDH method reaches 4.41 bits per pixel (BPP), which is 1.98 times that of other methods. As the embedded data increases, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of CRDHâs stego-images becomes higher compared to other methods. Furthermore, CRDH exhibits a significantly superior generalization ability in terms of both capacity and quality compared to state-of-the-art RDH methods.",

        "abstract": "The Web of Things (WoT) is a network that facilitates the formation and distribution of information its users make. Young people nowadays, digital natives, have no trouble relating to others or joining groups online since they have grown up in a world where new technology has pushed communications to a nearly real-time level. Shared private messages, rumours, and sexual comments are all examples of online harassment that have led to several recent cases worldwide. Therefore, academics have been more interested in finding ways to recognise bullying conduct on these platforms. The effects of cyberbullying, a terrible form of online misbehaviour, are distressing. It takes several documents, but the text is predominant on social networks. Intelligent systems are required for the automatic detection of such occurrences. Most previous research has used standard machine-learning techniques to tackle this issue. The increasing pervasiveness of cyberbullying in WoT and other social media platforms is a significant cause for worry that calls for robust responses to prevent further harm. This study offers a unique method of leveraging the deep learning (DL) model binary coyote optimization-based Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) in social networks to identify and classify cyberbullying. An essential part of this method is the combination of DL-based abuse detection and feature subset selection. To efficiently detect and address cases of cyberbullying via social media, the proposed system incorporates many crucial steps, including preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. A binary coyote optimization (BCO)-based feature subset selection method is presented to enhance classification efficiency. To improve the accuracy of cyberbullying categorization, the BCO algorithm efficiently chooses a selection of key characteristics. Cyberbullying must be tracked and classified across all internet channels, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed. With a best-ca...",

        "abstract": "With the expansion of mobile devices and cloud computing, massive spatial trajectory data is generated and outsourced to the cloud for storage and analysis, enabling location-based mobile computing services. However, due to the sensitivity of the trajectory data, sharing it in plaintext could lead to privacy risks, especially in operations like contact queries. Thus, achieving secure and efficient contact queries based on the trajectory data in the cloud is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving contact query processing over trajectory data in mobile cloud computing. The projection-based secure trajectory encoding is designed to convert trajectories into secure codes such that the comparison between the distance of two moving objects and the contact distance threshold is transformed into a problem of secure code matching. Adopting the secure code matching method, a baseline privacypreserving contact query processing is proposed. To improve the query accuracy and efficiency, an amplification factor, an HTG-index and a filter table are designed for query processing optimization, based on which an enhanced privacy-preserving contact query processing is proposed. The game stimulationbased security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed query scheme is secure and performs well in query accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is used for extracting blood oxygen signals from brain regions to map brain functional connectivity for brain disease prediction. Despite its effectiveness, fMRI has not been widely used: on the one hand, collecting and labeling the data is time-consuming and costly, which limits the amount of valid data collected at a single healthcare site; on the other hand, integrating data from multiple sites is challenging due to data privacy restrictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel, integrated Federated learning and Split learning Spatio-temporal Graph framework (FS 2 G). Specifically, we introduce federated learning and split learning techniques to split a spatio-temporal model into a client temporal model and a server spatial model. In the client temporal model, we propose a time-aware mechanism to focus on changes in brain functional states and use an InceptionTime model to extract information about changes in the brain states of each subject. In the server spatial model, we propose a united graph convolutional network to integrate multiple graph convolutional networks. Integrating federated learning and split learning, FS 2 G can utilize multi-site fMRI data without violating data privacy protection and reduce the risk of overfitting as it is capable of learning from limited training data sets. Moreover, it boosts the extraction of spatio-temporal features of fMRI using spatio-temporal graph networks. Experiments on ABIDE and ADHD200 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we explore biomarkers associated with brain disease prediction using community discovery algorithms using intermediate results of FS 2 G.

        "abstract": "Large amounts of high-dimensional unlabeled data typically contain only a small portion of truly effective information. Consequently, the issue of unsupervised feature selection methods has gained significant attention in research. However, current unsupervised feature selection approaches face limitations when dealing with datasets that exhibit uneven density, and they also require substantial computational time. To address this problem, this research article proposes a feature extraction technique that combines the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and $k$ -nearest neighbor rough sets. FCM is a clustering algorithm grounded in fuzzy theory, which takes into account the inherent data structure and the correlations between different features. Consequently, FCM is particularly well-suited for datasets with uneven density. Our proposed method consists of three steps. First, the FCM algorithm is used to cluster the unlabeled data. Second, a measure that evaluates the importance of features is defined and sorted based on the clustering results. Finally, redundant features are filtered using $k$ -nearest neighbor rough sets while retaining important features, significantly reducing the running time. In addition, we designed the feature selection algorithm (KND-UFS) and conducted experiments on 12 public datasets. We compared KND-UFS with eight existing algorithms in terms of running time, classification accuracy, and the number of selected features. The experimental results provided strong evidence supporting the superior performance of the KND-UFS algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Introduced by Google in 2016, Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework to ensure data privacy amid the surge in big data. FL enables secure data sharing without accessing local data. Despite its advantages, it faces challenges due to the limited participation of the data owner. To address this, this paper proposes the Model Value Transfer Incentive (MVTI) to enhance FL incentives for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). MVTI allows active participation of data requesters in FL training, addressing limited data owner engagement, and facilitating personalized model construction. The integrated model bail and contribution assessment mechanism ensures fair benefit redistribution. Using Smart Contracts (SC) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) enhances security and reliability, ensuring transparent and tamper-resistant execution for secure transactions and data integrity. Our experiments highlight MVTIâs superiority in addressing FL incentive challenges for AIoT compared to state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets. We also demonstrate the compatibility of multiple gradient protections with incentive mechanisms, especially with gradient compression. The proposed SC-MVTI scheme is resilient and demonstrates the potential to significantly improve the overall efficacy of the FL system within incentive frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Object detection, a fundamental task in computer vision, is crucial for various intelligent edge computing applications. However, object detection algorithms are usually heavy in computation, hindering their deployments on resource-constrained edge devices. Traditional edge-cloud collaboration schemes, like deep neural network (DNN) partitioning across edge and cloud, are unfit for object detection due to the significant communication costs incurred by the large size of intermediate results. To this end, we propose a Difficult-Case based Small-Big model (DCSB) framework. It employs a difficult-case discriminator on the edge device to control data transfer between the small model on the edge and the large model in the cloud. We also adopt regional sampling to further reduce the bandwidth consumption and create a discriminator zoo to accommodate the varying networking conditions. Additionally, we extend DCSB to video tasks by developing an adaptive sampling rate update algorithm, aiming to minimize computational demands without sacrificing detection accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DCSB can detect 97.26%-97.96% objects while saving 74.37%-82.23% network bandwidth, compared to cloud-only methods. Furthermore, DCSB significantly outperforms the latest DNN partitioning methods, reducing inference time by 92.60%-95.10% given an 8Mbps transmission bandwidth. In video tasks, DCSB matches the detection accuracy of leading video analysis methods while cutting the computational overhead by 40%.",

        "abstract": "Sound Source Localization (SSL) enabling technology for applications such as surveillance and robotics. While traditional Signal Processing (SP)-based SSL methods provide analytic solutions under specific signal and noise assumptions, recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have significantly outperformed them. However, their success depends on extensive training data and substantial computational resources. Moreover, they often rely on large-scale annotated spatial data and may struggle to adapt to evolving sound classes. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Class Incremental Learning (CIL) approach, termed SSL-CIL, which avoids serious accuracy degradation due to catastrophic forgetting by incrementally updating the DL-based SSL model through a closed-form analytic solution. In particular, data privacy is ensured since the learning process does not revisit any historical data (exemplar-free), which is more suitable for smart home scenarios. Empirical results in the public SSLR dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal, achieving a localization accuracy of 90.9%, surpassing other competitive methods.

        "abstract": "Transfer learning generally addresses to reduce the distribution distance between source-domain and target-domain. However, it is unreasonable to use a distribution to represent the life-cycle signals as they are always time-varying, and the improper assumption affects the efficacy of transfer remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. To fill this gap, this research proposes a micro transfer learning mechanism for multiple differentiated distributions, and a transfer RUL prediction model is constructed. First, a multi-cellular long short-term memory (MCLSTM) neural network is applied to obtain multiple differentiated distributions of the monitoring data at some point. Then the domain adversarial mechanism is used to achieve the knowledge transfer of multiple differentiated distributions at the cell level. Furthermore, an active screen mechanism is designed for weighting the domain discrimination losses of multiple differentiated distributions. Through the transfer RUL prediction experiments on aero-engines and actual wind turbine gearboxes, the superiority of this model over the advanced transfer prediction models is verified. Note to Practitioners âThe work is motivated by the accuracy reduction problem caused by the time-varying characteristics of life-cycle data in the cross domain equipment RUL prediction scenario, where a fixed single distribution is difficult to cover the full life-cycle data. This article proposes a micro transfer learning mechanism containing multiple differentiated distributions, and a novel transfer RUL prediction model based on the mechanism is constructed for solving the problem caused by the time-varying characteristics of life-cycle data. There are four steps for implementing this method in practice: 1) collecting the full-life cycle signals of historical equipment; 2) modeling the degradation curves of equipment by MCLSTM; 3) solving the cross domain RUL prediction by narrowing the distributions of degradation curves by the micro trans...",

        "abstract": "Accurate tissue segmentation of infant brain in magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for charting early brain development and identifying biomarkers. Due to ongoing myelination and maturation, in the isointense phase (6-9 months of age), the gray and white matters of infant brain exhibit similar intensity levels in MR images, posing significant challenges for tissue segmentation. Meanwhile, in the adult-like phase around 12 months of age, the MR images show high tissue contrast and can be easily segmented. In this paper, we propose to effectively exploit adult-like phase images to achieve robustmulti-view isointense infant brain segmentation. Specifically, in one way, we transfer adult-like phase images to the isointense view, which have similar tissue contrast as the isointense phase images, and use the transferred images to train an isointense-view segmentation network. On the other way, we transfer isointense phase images to the adult-like view, which have enhanced tissue contrast, for training a segmentation network in the adult-like view. The segmentation networks of different views form a multi-path architecture that performs multi-view learning to further boost the segmentation performance. Since anatomy-preserving style transfer is key to the downstream segmentation task, we develop a Disentangled Cycle-consistent Adversarial Network (DCAN) with strong regularization terms to accurately transfer realistic tissue contrast between isointense and adult-like phase images while still maintaining their structural consistency. Experiments on both NDAR and iSeg-2019 datasets demonstrate a significant superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development of the health insurance system, the problem of health insurance fraud is becoming more and more prominent. Health insurance fraud not only harms health insurance organizations financially but also causes serious disruptions to the normal provision of healthcare services. Current fraud detection methods usually rely on a single data source or specific features, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex patterns and intrinsic associations of fraudulent behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study is to efficiently integrate feature information from different perspectives of health insurance data using multiperspective representation learning. Health insurance fraud detection via multiview heterogeneous information networks with augmented graph structure learning (MHINAGSL) is proposed. Initially, multiple heterogeneous graphs are constructed based on health insurance datasets, encompassing diffusion, topology, feature, and semantic graphs. To enhance these foundational perspectives, a confidence fusion optimizer is employed. Additionally, a multichannel semantic graph convolution with shared parameters is introduced to effectively integrate diverse meta-path semantic graphs. Subsequently, an adaptive attention mechanism assigns weights to different views, facilitating the comprehensive fusion of information from multiple perspectives and enabling a more accurate characterization of the richness of health insurance data. Ultimately, the combination of multiple loss functions is employed for end-to-end model training, aiming to fully leverage the complementary advantages of multiview data, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of fraud detection models. We fully apply the proposed method to real health insurance datasets and provide in-depth validation of its comprehensive utility in real-world scenarios. Extensive experimental results fully confirm that our approach achieves significant results in imp...",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on comparing surface reflectances and optical water types (OWTs) obtained in Alqueva reservoir, located in the Alentejo region (Portugal), over a period of two decades (2003-2022) using four datasets: the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard Sentinel-3 and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2. The MODIS instrument, covers the entire study period, and acts as the benchmark for intercomparing the surface reflectances obtained with the other three sensors. The classification of OWTs is based on differences in reflectance spectra, facilitating a qualitative assessment of water quality. This approach identified four distinct clusters, with two OWTs representing water with higher turbidity, facilitating the differentiation of reflectances associated with microalgae blooms and other phenomena such as runoff. However, when using MODIS, which covers only the central area of the reservoir, only three clusters were identified as the ideal number. Using 300 m or 1000 m of spatial resolution, the Alqueva reservoir mostly exhibits high water transparency, associated with low surface reflectances for the majority of the time. Seasonal analysis revealed periods with the presence of microalgae in summer (JJA) and autumn (SON), with a noticeable increase in the intensity and duration of these blooms in the SON period over the last 10 years. This methodology enables the identification of advantages and disadvantages associated with the utilization of each sensor in large reservoirs and across extensive datasets.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a common and disabling mental illness, and most patients encounter cognitive deficits. The eye-tracking technology has been increasingly used to characterize cognitive deficits for its reasonable time and economic costs. However, there is no large-scale and publicly available eye movement dataset and benchmark for SZ recognition. To address these issues, we release a large-scale Eye Movement dataset for SZ recognition (EMS), which consists of eye movement data from 104 schizophrenics and 104 healthy controls (HCs) based on the free-viewing paradigm with 100 stimuli. We also conduct the first comprehensive benchmark, which has been absent for a long time in this field, to compare the related 13 psychosis recognition methods using six metrics. Besides, we propose a novel mean-shift-based network (MSNet) for eye movement-based SZ recognition, which elaborately combines the mean shift algorithm with convolution to extract the cluster center as the subject feature. In MSNet, first, a stimulus feature branch (SFB) is adopted to enhance each stimulus feature with similar information from all stimulus features, and then, the cluster center branch (CCB) is utilized to generate the cluster center as subject feature and update it by the mean shift vector. The performance of our MSNet is superior to prior contenders, thus, it can act as a powerful baseline to advance subsequent study. To pave the road in this research field, the EMS dataset, the benchmark results, and the code of MSNet are publicly available at https://github.com/YingjieSong1/EMS.",

        "abstract": "Automated analysis of aviation safety reports is helpful in effectively preventing future accidents and improving emergency response capabilities. To date, there are no publicly available large-scale aviation text similarity datasets, which hinders the successful application of NLP techniques in the aviation domain. We present an automatically created aviation text similarity dataset consisting of more than 500,000 pairs for fine-tuning pretrained language models. Since technical terms have specialized meanings that differ from everyday language, we propose an efficient semantic encoding algorithm to improve the ability of embeddings to adequately represent aviation terms. We provide new solutions and revised evaluation metrics for the classification and the retrieval of safety reports, confirming the reliability of our dataset and the superiority of our algorithm. Note to Practitioners âText representation is an essential task in natural language processing(NLP). A crucial step towards the successful application of NLP in safety reports analysis is to ensure that aviation texts are adequately encoded. Aiming at the problem of poor ability of current embeddings to represent technical terms, we automatically create an aviation text similarity dataset and propose a semantic encoding algorithm for aviation terms. It is clear that the proposed method has great potential in representation of technical terms, thus providing assistance for downstream tasks such as text classification, information retrieval and question answering.",

        "abstract": "To avoid the complex and resource-intensive electromagnetic absorber (EMA) modeling and simulation, this letter proposes to use the convolutional perfectly matched layer (CPML) with the complex frequency-shifted (CFS) factor instead of the EMA in broadband full-wave simulations by optimizing the CPML so that its frequency-domain reflection coefficient (FDRC) approaches that of the EMA. Six parameters determining the distribution of the space-stretched variable, the conductivity, and the CFS factor in the perfectly matched layer (PML) regions and, thus, the absorbing performance of the PML are used as the optimized parameters. An efficient optimization method based on the artificial neural network is proposed to optimize these six parameters by minimizing the mean square error between the FDRCs of the CPML and the EMA. An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.",

        "abstract": "In the era of complex data environments, accurately measuring uncertainty is crucial for effective decision making. Complex evidence theory (CET) provides a framework for handling uncertainty reasoning in the complex plane. Within CET, complex basic belief assignment (CBBA) aims to tackle the uncertainty and imprecision inherent in data coinciding with phase or periodic changes. However, measuring the uncertainty of CBBA over time remains an open issue. This study introduces a novel entropy model, the complex belief (CB) entropy, within the framework of CET, designed to tackle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in data with phase or periodic changes. The model is developed by integrating concepts of interference and fractal theory to extend the understanding of uncertainty over time. Methodologically, the CB entropy is constructed to include discord, nonspecificity, and an interaction term for focal elements, defined as interference. In addition, thanks to the concept of the fractal, the model is further generalized to time fractal-based CB (TFCB) entropy for forecasting future uncertainties. We furthermore analyze the properties of the entropy models. Findings demonstrate that the proposed entropy models provide a more comprehensive measure of uncertainty in complex scenarios. Finally, a decision-making method based on the proposed entropy is proposed.",

        "abstract": "With advancements in AI, smart home gyms are becoming increasingly popular for providing fitness assistance in indoor environments. In this research, we propose a layer-by-layer framework, called Wi-Fitness, which bridges video perception with Wi-Fi sensing for smart fitness. At the data pre-processing layer, the SVD-based CSI denoising mechanism is leveraged to do the Wi-Fi data calibration. Diverse and high-quality training samples are generated by a random quantization-based data augmentation method. At the bimodal fusion layer, the heterogeneity between the Wi-Fi and video is mitigated by the local attention mechanism and the bimodal feature integration mechanism. For the video modality, the attention-based spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (AST-GCN Net) is proposed to refine spatial information. The spatio-temporal semantic alignment module is proposed to transfer spatial information from video to Wi-Fi and maintain temporal consistency across modalities. The fitness assessment layer provides exercise visualization. The generalization of Wi-Fitness is enhanced by layer-by-layer collaboration. Wi-Fitness demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving an average F1-Score of 92.68% in three typical indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "As the representative density-based clustering algorithm, density peaks clustering (DPC) has wide recognition, and many improved algorithms and applications have been extended from it. However, the DPC involving privacy protection has not been deeply studied. In addition, there is still room for improvement in the selection of centers and allocation methods of DPC. To address these issues, vertical federated density peaks clustering under nonlinear mapping (VFDPC) is proposed to address privacy protection issues in vertically partitioned data. Firstly, a hybrid encryption privacy protection mechanism is proposed to protect the merging process of distance matrices generated by client data. Secondly, according to the merged distance matrix, a more effective cluster merging under nonlinear mapping is proposed to ameliorate the process of DPC. Results on man-made, real, and multi-view data fully prove the improvement of VFDPC on clustering accuracy.",

        "abstract": "High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data commonly arise in various Big Data-related applications, e.g., recommender systems and bioinformatics. Representation is a learning paradigm to map HDI data into low-dimensional latent space for attracting valuable knowledge and patterns. Currently, deep neural network (DNN) is one of the most popular and successful approaches to represent HDI data due to its powerful nonlinear learning ability. However, previous DNNs-based approaches primarily focused on advancing the sophisticated model structure, neglecting the potential adverse effects of outliers. Unfortunately, outliers usually exist in the collected HDI data. For example, HDI data collected from recommender systems inevitably contain many outlier ratings due to some malicious users. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel outlier-resilient autoencoder (termed ORA). Its core idea is to design an adaptive Cauchy loss strategy to measure the difference between the observed and predicted data for an autoencoder in representing the HDI data. This strategy leverages a more aggressive Cauchy loss to impose a higher penalty on outlier data with large deviation, while utilizing a smoother Cauchy loss to capture the nuanced, deeper features of HDI data. As such, ORA can dynamically adjust the smoothness of the Cauchy loss during training to handle different levels of data deviation. To evaluate the proposed ORA, extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark HDI datasets. The results validate that: (1) ORA achieves significantly better representation accuracy than State-of-the-Art DNN- and non-DNN-based models, and (2) ORA possesses higher robustness to outlier data than its peers.",

        "abstract": "Energy trading in distributed microgrids represents an effective means of enhancing the utilization of renewable energy. However, the aggregation of large-scale consumption data may encounter business scalability issues and potential privacy exposure concerns, necessitating the development of novel secure and scalable frameworks for integrating consumption demands between prosumer and microgrid entities. we research focuses on providing a user-friendly transaction model for consumers and microgrid operators. Firstly, a privacy aggregation scheme for user resource requests is designed to ensure the security and decentralization of user data. In addition, the model employs a bidirectional heterogeneous resource allocation mechanism to support the optimal allocation of multiple resources, such as renewable energy, power assets, energy storage devices, and carbon credits, among different microgrids. Finally, a microgrid transaction prototype has been constructed on the Truffle development framework. In this context, smart contracts has been designed to ensure that the transactions are carried out automatically. Experimental results indicate that the scheme provides enhanced security for multi-resource trading in a cluster context relative to existing methodologies. The number of transactions increases linearly with the resource overhead, resulting in more efficient utilization of energy trading. Furthermore, the frameworkâs scalability has been demonstrated through both temporal and spatial considerations.",

        "abstract": "The complexity and heterogeneity of the Sixth Generation (6G) networks raise trust issues among network users. Implementing blockchain-based decentralized trust management in 6G networks ensures user trustworthiness while mitigating the risk of single-point failures. However, the throughput limitation of the blockchain restricts the efficiency of recording trust data, leading to the inability to promptly expose trustless users in the system. To address this issue, this article proposes a Multi-State Consensus (MSC), a blockchain-based trust management scheme that incorporates three novel consensus protocols. These three novel consensus protocols are utilized in different network states to efficiently record the trust data of trustless users, thereby exposing them more quickly. Additionally, in MSC, new users gain initial trust values through the multi-signatures of blockchain miners, thereby addressing the trust value cold-start problem. Experimental results demonstrate that MSC not only exposes trustless users more rapidly but also ensures the robustness of network operations.",

        "abstract": "Scaling up power infrastructures to accommodate growing data center demand is very costly and one of the biggest challenges faced by data centers today. In this paper, we propose to leverage market approaches for maximizing power capacity utilization in multi-tenant data centers, a crucial but under-explored type of data centers. Our study transforms the current practice that simply allocates power capacity in a fixed manner, into a dynamic, scalable, and coordinated market-based paradigm. To illustrate our design, we consider power oversubscription and study gracefully handling the occasional power emergencies in oversubscribed multi-tenant data centers. Concretely, we present a market approach, called COOrdinated Power management solution (COOP), which extracts tenantsâ power reduction capabilities at runtime and judiciously coordinates tenantsâ power reduction at a minimum performance cost.",

        "abstract": "Accurately identifying correct correspondences (inliers) in two-view images is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent studies usually adopt Graph Neural Networks or stack local graphs into global ones to establish neighborhood relations. However, the smoothing properties of Graph Convolutional Neural network (GCN) cause the model to fall into local extreme, which leads to the issue of indistinguishability between inliers and outliers. Especially when the initial correspondences contain a large number of incorrect correspondences (outliers), these studies suffer from severe performance degradation. To address the above issues and refocus perspective information on distinct features, we design a Consistency Guided ResFormer Network (CGR-Net) that uses consistent correspondences to guide model perspective focusing, thereby avoiding the negative impact of outliers. Specifically, we design an efficient Graph Score Calculation module, which aims to compute global graph scores by enhancing the representation of important features and comprehensively capturing the contextual relationships between correspondences. Then, we propose a Consistency Guided Correspondences Selection module to dynamically fuse global graph scores and consistency graphs and construct a novel consistency matrix to accurately recognize inliers. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate that our CGR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/XiaojieLi11/CGR-Net.",

        "abstract": "Real-world datasets are often imbalanced, posing frequent challenges to canonical machine learning algorithms that assume a balanced class distribution. Moreover, the imbalance problem becomes more complicated when the dataset is multiclass. Although many approaches have been presented for imbalanced learning (IL), research on the multiclass imbalanced problem is relatively limited and deficient. To alleviate these issues, we propose a forest of evolutionary hierarchical classifiers (FEHC) method for multiclass IL (MCIL). FEHC can be seen as a classifier fusion framework with a forest structure, and it aggregates several evolutionary hierarchical multiclassifiers (EHMCs) to reduce generalization error. Specifically, a multichromosome genetic algorithm (MCGA) is designed to simultaneously select (sub)optimal features, classifiers, and hierarchical structures when generating these EHMCs. The MCGA adopts a dynamic weighting module to learn difficult classes and promote the diversity of FEHC. We also present the âstratified underbaggingâ (SUB) strategy to address class imbalance and the âsoft tree traversalâ (STT) strategy to make FEHC converge faster and better. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed algorithm using 14 multiclass imbalanced datasets with various properties. Compared with popular and state-of-the-art approaches, FEHC obtains better performance under different evaluation metrics. Codes have been made publicly available on GitHub.https://github.com/CUHKSZ-NING/FEHCClassifier",

        "abstract": "Fingerprint localization methods typically require a substantial amount of manual effort to collect fingerprint data from various scenarios to construct an accurate radio map. While some existing research has attempted to use path planning strategies to save on labor costs, these approaches often suffer from being time-consuming and prone to locally optimal solutions. To address these shortcomings, our paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes imitation learning to construct and update a highly accurate radio map with minimal manual intervention in dynamic environments. Specifically, we employ a multivariate Gaussian process model to fit a rough standby fingerprint database with only a few pilot data points. We then utilize a state space model to calculate the variation range of the pilot data, which forms the CSI error band used to filter the rough radio map. Imitation learning and a confidence coefficient are utilized to predict and calibrate the global CSI data distribution. And we utilize the K-nearest neighbor algorithm to achieve the real-time localization function. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in most test cases, exhibiting low computation complexity, lower localization error, and saving 73.3% of the manual workload.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a debilitating ocular complication demanding timely intervention and treatment. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) has notably enhanced the efficiency of conventional manual diagnosis. However, the scarcity of existing DR datasets hinders the progress of data-driven DL models, especially for pixel-level lesion annotation datasets, which severely impedes the advancement of DR lesion segmentation tasks required for precise interpretations of DR grading. Furthermore, the escalating concerns surrounding medical data security and privacy induce data collection challenges for traditional centralized learning, exacerbating the issue of data silos. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive FL framework for DR diagnosis and fails to exploit multiple diverse DR datasets simultaneously. To address the challenges of data scarcity and privacy, we construct a high-quality pixel-level DR lesion annotation dataset (TJDR) and propose a novel FL-based DR diagnosis framework including both DR grading and multi-lesion segmentation. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of pixel-level DR lesion datasets, we propose $\bm {\u0007lpha }$ -Fed and adaptive- $\bm {\u0007lpha }$ -Fed, two efficient cross-dataset FL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and the two cross-dataset FL algorithms. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/NekoPii/TJDR-FL .",

        "abstract": "Time-series prediction has drawn considerable attention during the past decades fueled by the emerging advances of deep learning methods. However, most neural network based methods fail in extracting the hidden mechanism of the targeted physical system. To overcome these shortcomings, an interpretable sparse system identification method without any prior knowledge is proposed in this study. This method adopts the Fourier transform to reduces the irrelevant items in the dictionary matrix, instead of indiscriminate usage of polynomial functions in most system identification methods. It shows an visible system representation and greatly reduces computing cost. With the adoption of $l_{1}$ norm in regularizing the parameter matrix, a sparse description of the system model can be achieved. Moreover, three data sets including the water conservancy data, global temperature data and financial data are used to test the performance of the proposed method. Although no prior knowledge was known about the physical background, experimental results show that our method can achieve long-term prediction regardless of the noise and incompleteness in the original data more accurately than the widely-used baseline data-driven methods. This study may provide some insight into time-series prediction investigations, and suggests that a white-box system identification method may extract the easily overlooked yet inherent periodical features and may beat neural-network based black-box methods on long-term prediction tasks.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable development goals (SDGs) promoted by the United Nations guide the survival and development of human beings. Sustainable community development is an important part of SDGs, which aims at efficient and equitable utilizations of natural and social resources to construct more livable, productive, and environmentally-sound communities. Despite the growing concern of this issue, there are few review efforts to clarify the concepts, technical development and challenges in facilitating sustainable communities. Accordingly, this study will review the emerging spatiotemporal big data and novel analysis techniques to explore their contributions to community modeling, monitoring, evaluation, and optimization, and, more importantly, the study will point out the great challenges and future directions of applying spatiotemporal data to sustainable community development. For community modeling, existing geographic object modeling struggled to capture the spatial structures, functional services, and temporal changes of communities, and cannot provide accurate and comprehensive geographic representations of communities. For community monitoring and evaluation, previous monitored indicators often exhibit variations in spatial/temporal scales and representations, affecting the integration of multiple indicators and overall evaluation of community sustainability. For community optimization, existing spatial optimization and simulation methods ignored the evolutionary processes of communities, making the optimization results far away from the actual development trends. Addressing these challenges through innovative geographic modeling methods, comprehensive indicator monitoring and evaluation, and novel understandings on community optimization will unlock the potential of spatiotemporal big data to empower sustainable community development initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Areas of interest (AOIs) are well-established means of providing semantic information for visualizing, analyzing, and classifying gaze data. However, the usual manual annotation of AOIs is time-consuming and further impaired by ambiguities in label assignments. To address these issues, we present an interactive labeling approach that combines visualization, machine learning, and user-centered explainable annotation. Our system provides uncertainty-aware visualization to build trust in classification with an increasing number of annotated examples. It combines specifically designed EyeFlower glyphs, dimensionality reduction, and selection and exploration techniques in an integrated workflow. The approach is versatile and hardware-agnostic, supporting video stimuli from stationary and unconstrained mobile eye tracking alike. We conducted an expert review to assess labeling strategies and trust building.",

        "abstract": "Given the critical role of rotating machinery in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS), ensuring their reliable operation is essential for the stability and safety of ICPS. Deep neural networks have demonstrated competitive results for intelligent fault diagnosis, which are usually trained via the historical data of all fault modes. However, in real engineering, it is usually difficult to collect samples and exhaust all failures during the training stage. As a result, out-of-distribution fault diagnosis (OOD-FD) becomes a more realistic problem that requires the methods to not only accurately diagnose the known faults, but also effectively recognize unknown ones. Therefore, a novel orthogonal anchor clustering with focal attention (FA-OAC) is proposed in this paper for OOD-FD. Firstly, an orthogonal anchor clustering (OAC) algorithm is proposed to fix the class center of each fault mode orthogonally and distinguish the known and unknown faults at the class level. Then, because the identifiability of different fault modes changes a lot in OOD-FD, the focal attention mechanism is applied to dynamically adjust the attention to different fault modes according to the distance loss of OAC, thus addressing the identifiability imbalance problem. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, different OODFD tasks are designed based on two rotating machinery datasets. The experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art fault diagnosis methods have demonstrated that the proposed method has improved the OOD-FD performance greatly and therefore provides an effective tool in real engineering.",

A self-supervised auxiliary task is proposed to help the agent to learn environmental knowledge.

The agent is trained and evaluated in real-world data, and experimental results demonstrate that it can obtain traversable and safe paths while generalizing effectively to unknown environments.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) is expected to achieve effective knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a heterogeneous target domain with scarce labeled data. Most prior HDA methods strive to align the cross-domain feature distributions by learning domain invariant representations without considering the intrinsic semantic correlations among categories, which inevitably results in the suboptimal adaptation performance across domains. Therefore, to address this issue, we propose a novel semantic correlation transfer (SCT) method for HDA, which not only matches the marginal and conditional distributions between domains to mitigate the large domain discrepancy, but also transfers the category correlation knowledge underlying the source domain to target by maximizing the pairwise class similarity across source and target. Technically, the domainwise and classwise centroids (prototypes) are first computed and aligned according to the feature embeddings. Then, based on the derived classwise prototypes, we leverage the cosine similarity of each two classes in both domains to transfer the supervised source semantic correlation knowledge among different categories to target effectively. As a result, the feature transferability and category discriminability can be simultaneously improved during the adaptation process. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on standard HDA tasks, such as text-to-image, image-to-image, and text-to-text, have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed SCT against several state-of-the-art HDA methods.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is an innovative paradigm expected to enable various consumer applications that is transforming our lives. While enjoying benefits and services from these applications, we also face serious security issues due to malicious cyber attacks on the massive growth of AIoT consumer devices. Accurate anomaly detection is one of the critical tasks for the trustworthy AIoT removing those obstacles. However, limited by the vector-based data pattern and ill-considered factors for anomalous samples analysis, existing methods suffer from the low detection performance. In this paper, a multi-scale correlation tensor convolutional Gaussian mixture network (named as MTCGM) is presented for ameliorating this actuality. Specifically, MTCGM suggests to construct the multi-scale correlation tensor by stacking one self-correlation matrix and multiple surrounding-correlations of different scales, which well characterizes the network status of AIoT. Subsequently, a 3D-convolutional autoencoder (3DCA) is designed for capturing inter-feature correlations, and followed with a Gaussian mixture probability (GMP) network for the observations likelihood estimation. Moreover, low-dimensional space features, relative Euclidean distance and tensor cosine similarity (TCS) are adopted in MTCGM as the multi-factor to boost the likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets verify the validity of MTCGM, and demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines even in presence of contaminated training samples and input noise.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty is a crucial aspect in real-life scenarios, especially when dealing with ambiguous information from multimodal data sources. Complex evidence theory (CET), a generalized form of DempsterâShafer evidence theory that uses complex numbers to describe uncertainty, offers a more promising framework for dealing with uncertainty in many fields. Focusing on conflict management in the CET framework, new divergence measures, namely, complex belief KullbackâLeibler (CBKL) divergence and complex belief JensenâShannon (CBJS) divergence, are proposed in this article to quantify the discrepancy between complex evidence bodies. Additionally, novel multisource information fusion methods based on CBKL divergence and CBJS divergence for decision making are proposed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, classification tasks are performed. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed methods in handling complex evidence fusion and decision-making tasks.",

        "abstract": "Stance detection on social media has become increasingly important for understanding public opinions on controversial issues. Existing methods often require large amounts of labeled data to learn target-independent transferable knowledge, which is infeasible under zero-shot settings where the target is unseen. Furthermore, most current stance detection models, primarily based on end-to-end deep learning architectures, lack transparency and may produce counter-intuitive and uninterpretable predictions. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge-augmented interpretable network (KAI) to enable zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD). First, we introduce an unsupervised approach based on large language models (LLMKE) to elicit analysis perspectives, which is target-independent knowledge shared across different targets. This transferable knowledge bridges connections between seen and unseen targets. Second, we develop a bidirectional knowledge-guided neural production system (Bi-KGNPS) that effectively integrates such transferable knowledge through an iterative knowledge-variable binding process to guide stance predictions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate KAI achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ZSSD. Moreover, our approach also delivers strong results on conventional in-target and cross-target stance detection. With the dual benefits of knowledge-augmented accuracy and model interpretability, this work represents an important advance toward practical stance detection systems that can generalize to emerging topics of interest. The proposed KAI framework provides an interpretable approach to effectively transfer knowledge across domains for zero-shot learning.",

        "abstract": "Identifying subcellular localization of microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for comprehensive understanding of cellular function and has significant implications for drug design. In the past, several computational methods for miRNA subcellular localization is being used for uncovering multiple facets of RNA function to facilitate the biological applications. Unfortunately, most existing classification methods rely on a single sequencebased view, making the effective fusion of data from multiple heterogeneous networks a primary challenge. Inspired by multi-view multi-label learning strategy, we propose a computational method, named MMLmiRLocNet, for predicting the subcellular localizations of miRNAs. The MMLmiRLocNet predictor extracts multi-perspective sequence representations by analyzing lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of biological sequences. Specifically, it integrates lexical attributes derived from k-mer physicochemical profiles, syntactic characteristics obtained via word2vec embeddings, and semantic representations generated by pre-trained feature embeddings. Finally, module for extracting multi-view consensus-level features and specific-level features was constructed to capture consensus and specific features from various perspectives. The full connection networks are utilized as the output module to predict the miRNA subcellular localization. Experimental results suggest that MMLmiRLocNet outperforms existing methods in terms of F1, subACC, and Accuracy, and achieves best performance with the help of multi-view consensus features and specific features extract network.",

        "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of the IoT and data-driven applications, low-latency task scheduling methods that quickly respond to user tasks has become a significant challenge for edge servers. However, the existing task scheduling strategies do not overcome the impact of factors such as task characteristics, resource availability, and network conditions on delays. Meanwhile, the cross-regional maldistribution of edge servers is obvious, and the edge servers are either idle or overloaded. To address these issues, we propose a low-latency edge scheduling strategy based on the Hard Attention Mechanism and Advantage Actor-Critic (HA-A2C). The core element of this method is the adoption of a hard attention mechanism, which reduces computing complexity and increases efficiency. Effective attention allocation during the resource allocation process further reduces job completion time. Additionally, the deep reinforcement learning method is employed to enhance task dynamic scheduling capabilities, thereby reducing scheduling delays. The HA-A2C approach reduces task latency by approximately 40% compared to the DQN method. Consequently, the intelligent allocation of task resources achieved by integrating the hard attention technique significantly reduces task scheduling time in edge environments.",

        "abstract": "Fuzzy logic can effectively deal with many uncertain problems due to its unique fuzziness and insensitivity to data, so it is widely used in health scenarios with precision grading quantification. Therefore, an analog circuit of memristive fuzzy logic for blood pressure grading quantification is designed in this paper. The circuit includes 1) fuzzifier module, 2) rule base module, 3) inference engine module. The fuzzifier module uses a memristor array to build a membership function circuit that can be fully programmed in parallel, and converts the input systolic and diastolic blood pressure signals into corresponding membership degrees through the circuit. The rule base module mainly implements fuzzy rules based on blood pressure fuzzy semantic sets through analog circuits. The function of the inference engine module is to transform the blood pressure rules stored in the rule base into the mapping relationship between fuzzy semantic sets, and to infer the results of blood pressure grading quantification. The PSPICE simulation results show that the calculation precision of the memristive fuzzy logic circuit can reach about 99.7%, and the accuracy rate of the circuit to achieve the blood pressure grading quantification reaches 98.69%. Compared to traditional digital circuits, this circuit has significant advantages in terms of power consumption and computational speed.",

        "abstract": "The matrix factorization (MF) model has a wide range of applications in signal processing and machine learning. Existing decentralized MF methods require to know the matrix rank a prior, which however is difficult to obtain especially when the data are distributively stored in a network. In the two-part paper, we study a rank-adaptive MF algorithm which proceeds in decentralized setting and meanwhile does not need to know the matrix rank precisely. In the Part-I paper, we have proposed to achieve the rank adaption through a novel l1-norm regularizer, and demonstrated its efficacy via numerical experiments. In this Part-II paper, our goal is to build the convergence conditions and the convergence rate of the proposed rank-adaptive algorithm. In particular, we first consider the decentralized MF algorithm with known rank and show that when the step size is set as $O(t^{-\\delta})$ for $\\delta \\in (1/2, 2/3]$ , the algorithm converges to the global optima with rate $O(t^{-\\delta})$ with high probability, whereas when the step-size is a constant, the algorithm converges with a linear rate, but only to the neighborhood of the global optima. Then we extend the analysis to the rank-adaptive algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources into power systems is crucial to lower carbon emissions, yet the resulting uncertainty presents challenges to network reliability. In the era of digital energy, Big Data models help reduce uncertainty by identifying data patterns for accurate predictions. Yet, the efficacy of data-driven models is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality training data, underscoring the significance of identifying and selecting datasets of superior quality. This paper proposes a novel data valuation framework based on deep reinforcement learning for the analysis and decomposition of uncertainty in renewable energy datasets. Our framework merges meteorological and power uncertainty through predictive tasks, training a neural network to uncover the intrinsic relationships between data features and their value via a sampling-feedback mechanism. By incorporating policy gradient and other optimization techniques, we enhance the algorithm's stability and efficiency, supplemented by comparative experiments for validation. We tested our valuation approach using 2017-2018 aggregate wind related data from Yunnan province for power forecasting. The results demonstrate that our proposed data value approach effectively enhances the quality of the dataset, leading to a proportional improvement of 7.69% in prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The mass volume of data in the modern business world requires fraud detection to be automated. Hence, some researchers constructed the fraud scenario into graph data and proposed graph-based fraud detection methods. These methods treat the problem of fraud detection as a binary node classification task. However, the differences between the nodes of the same class are ignored. In this paper, we try to distinguish differences in behavior among nodes of the same class to improve the model's ability to detect deviation, i.e., we make a fine-grained classification of user behavior (called prototypes) and propose an adaptive prototype-based graph neural network (APGNN) for fraud detection. APGNN learns node behavior representations by extracting both neighborhood and global information, supplying preliminary knowledge for the adaptive creation of several prototypes, each representing a distinct behavior pattern. Subsequently, a new loss function is employed to enhance the prototypes' capacity to capture these behavior patterns and to amplify the feature differences between different prototypes. Nodes are then projected onto these prototypes to derive the final behavior patterns. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that this method can provide better fraud detection as well as a more understandable result.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL) has made impressive progress in natural language processing, especially in sentence representation learning. Plenty of data augmentation methods have been proposed for the generation of positive samples. However, due to the highly abstract nature of natural language, these augmentations cannot maintain the quality of generated positive samples, e.g., too easy or hard samples. To this end, we propose to improve the quality of positive examples from a data arrangement perspective and develop a novel model-agnostic approach: ( DCLCSE ) for sentence embeddings. Specifically, we propose to incorporate a curriculum learning strategy to control the positive example usage. At the early learning stage, easy samples are selected to optimize the CL-based model. As the model's capability increases, we gradually select harder samples for model training, ensuring the learning efficiency of the model. Furthermore, we design a novel difficulty measurement module to calculate the difficulty of generated positives, in which the model's capability is considered for the accurate sample difficulty measurement. Based on this, we develop multiple arrangement strategies to facilitate the model learning process based on learned difficulties. Finally, extensive experiments over multiple representative models demonstrate the superiority of  DCLCSE . As a byproduct, we have released the codes to facilitate other researchers.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) enables the retrieval and update of massive encrypted data and is thus widely applied in cloud storage. Malicious cloud servers may tamper with outsourced data or return incorrect search results, making verification indispensable. However, current verifiable conjunctive DSSE with forward and backward privacy cannot simultaneously achieve accurate search and empty result verification. Given the above problems, we propose a novel forward and backward private conjunctive DSSE with comprehensive verification called VCFB. VCFB introduces the notion of random blinding factors and secure dynamic cross-tags to achieve accurate conjunctive search with sublinear overhead. We design the search state and construct chain structures to ensure forward security. The new verification algorithm based on bilinear-map dynamic accumulators can guarantee the verifiability of search results even if an empty result is returned. We use a sample check method to verify the new dynamic cross-tags, reducing computation costs. We precisely define the leakage function of VCFB and give detailed security proof, demonstrating that VCFB is forward and backward private under the malicious server model. Experimental results show that VCFB ensures efficient and accurate conjunctive search, outperforming the similar verifiable conjunctive DSSE scheme regarding indexing storage and update performance.",

        "abstract": "Depending on large-scale devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) provides massive data support for resource sharing and intelligent decision, but privacy risks also increase. As a popular distributed learning framework, Federated Learning (FL) is widely used because it does not need to share raw data while only parameters to collaboratively train models. However, Federated Learning is not spared by some emerging attacks, e.g., membership inference attack. Therefore, for IoT devices with limited resources, it is challenging to design a defense scheme against the membership inference attack ensuring high model utility, strong membership privacy and acceptable time efficiency. In this paper, we propose MemDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism to prevent membership inference attack from local models and global models in IoT-based FL, while maintaining high model utility. MemDefense adds crafted pruning perturbations to local models at each round of FL by deploying two key components, i.e., parameter filter and noise generator. Specifically, the parameter filter selects the apposite model parameters which have little impact on the model test accuracy and contribute more to member inference attacks. Then, the noise generator is used to find the pruning noise that can reduce the attack accuracy while keeping high model accuracy, protecting each participant's membership privacy. We comprehensively evaluate MemDefense with different deep learning models and multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that lowcost MemDefense drastically reduces the attack accuracy within limited drop of classification accuracy, meeting the requirements for model utility, membership privacy and time efficiency.",

        "abstract": "As the accumulation of multi-view data continues to grow, multi-view clustering has become increasingly important in research fields like data mining. However, current methods have been criticized for their unsatisfactory performance, such as insufficient exploration of intra-view high-order relationships and poor characterization of inter-view diverse features. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Local Highorder Graph Learning for Multi-View Clustering (LHGL_MVC). Our method aims to explore high-order relationships within a view while also considering diverse information between views. In LHGL_MVC, we learn the initial graphs of each view through self-representation, which are decomposed into consistent and diverse parts to better capture the diversity of different views. Based on consistent parts, we propose a novel local high-order graph learning approach to more effectively explore high-order relationships between samples within each view. At the same time, we leverage high-order relationships between views using the rotated tensor nuclear norm. Finally, we obtain a unified graph for clustering by fusing all consistent affinity graphs and their high-order graphs with adaptive weights. All procedures are integrated into an overall objective function, which mutually promotes during the optimization process. The comprehensive experiments conducted on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that LHGL_MVC significantly outperforms existing algorithms in various measurements, highlighting the superiority of the proposed method",

        "abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data era, large-scale data analysis necessitates rapid and efficient machine learning techniques. Traditional distributed learning methods often rely on a central server and an online privacy model, which poses challenges for scalability and data privacy. We propose a decentralized high-level Proof-of-Work (HPoW) algorithm to address these issues, leveraging blockchain technology to develop a comprehensive predictive model. Our approach ensures participant data privacy through the implementation of a differential privacy scheme and establishes a secure environment against Byzantine attacks. Furthermore, the training of numerous machine learning models in cloud computing environments can lead to data anomalies, adversely affecting resource allocation and overall system performance. We introduce a cloud computing incentive mechanism designed specifically for distributed machine learning frameworks to mitigate these challenges. We present novel methodologies and provide mathematical proof that our blockchain-based approach significantly enhances the establishment of a Nash equilibrium among participating entities. Finally, we present the machine learning service on the blockchain with the cloud service aiding through in-depth experiments to show how well it works and to conclude on a transparent Nash equilibrium value with an incentive value of 14.3Gwei after a successful session, highlighting our proposed systemâs practical viability and performance benefits.",

        "abstract": "Robot perception difficulties in complex environments seriously affect robot operational efficiency. The application of generative big model (GBM) technology on robots through the agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) can solve the difficulty of low operational efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic decision-making localization algorithm for robots fused with generative big models in agriculture Internet of Things. First, in the agriculture Internet of Things, the complex agricultural scene information is acquired in real-time by the Realsense D435i equipped on the robot, which is accessed in the GBM through a proprietary network to realize real-time intelligent sensing and control between the environmental information and the robot. Then, the innovative reinforcement learning method based on human solid feedback (S-RLHF) and the automatic generation method of weakly supervised fine-tuning data (WS-FT DAGM) are designed in the generative large model. At the same time, by combining the characteristics of the robot operation, two generative significant model recommendation methods are designed, which solves the problem of the difficulty of the target perception in the complex agricultural scene. Finally, by integrating the agriculture Internet of Things and generative large models, the critical method of real-time analysis of crop shading characteristics by the large model is innovatively proposed to solve the problem of low efficiency in robot operation. In the robot test experiments, the operation efficiency using the fusion of agriculture Internet of Things and generative large model reaches more than 92%, significantly improving the operation efficiency compared to the small model (CNN) method without agriculture Internet of Things and generative large model in the traditional agricultural robot.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 10 million people worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the detection of PD remains a complicated task, as no gold standard test has yet been developed to provide an accurate diagnosis. In this context, many recent studies have focused on the automatic detection and progression tracking of PD from voice-related characteristics, being feature engineering the most common approach. This work intends to address an existing research gap by introducing a novel strategy that analyzes raw voice waveforms. Despite recent advancements, one of the significant hurdles is still the lack of extensive and diverse datasets. This paper also implements a data augmentation solution. Big Vocoder Slicing Adversarial Network (BigVSAN) is used to generate synthetic voice data that mimics the characteristics of real patients and healthy subjects. For the PD detection task, deep learning models such as ResNet, LSTM-FCN, InceptionTime, and CDIL-CNN are used. The experiments were performed using the speech task of sustained vowel /a/ in the PC-GITA database, which contains the recordings of healthy and PD subjects. CDIL-CNN achieves the best results, improving the accuracy by 15.87% (8.96%) compared to the model that does not use augmented data (from the best method found in the literature that uses voice waveforms). The results of this study indicate that models trained with raw waveforms showcase modest but promising performance, underlying the potential of audio analysis to improve the early detection of PD, providing a non-invasive and potentially remotely applicable method.",

        "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology empowers WiFi to function as both sensors for wireless sensing and communication devices for data exchange. Currently, achieving accurate object tracking with commercial WiFi devices is still challenging due to the limited bandwidth, a small number of antennas, and the clock asynchronization in a bi-static setup. Many existing methods achieve tracking only via extracting a dominant Doppler frequency shift (DFS) from a moving person. However, since the human body is non-rigid, various body parts generate different DFSs, and different subcarriers can exhibit varying Doppler characteristics in a multipath environment. This work presents WiDFS2.0, an enhanced real-time tracking scheme that leverages the micro-Doppler effect to extract multiple signal features from various body parts of a moving person, represented as WiFi point clouds. Each point cloud consists of Doppler, AoA, Range, and signal-to-noise ratio. We design a novel signal processing chain to extract the WiFi point clouds. Then we refine these point clouds and implement an extended Kalman filter-based algorithm to track the personâs trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate that WiDFS2.0 can achieve real-time tracking with a median position error of 0.55 m, while determining the presence of a moving person with over 98% accuracy during tracking.",

        "abstract": "Gesture recognition has drawn considerable attention from many researchers owing to its wide range of applications. Although significant progress has been made in this field, previous works always focus on how to distinguish between different gesture classes, ignoring the influence of inner-class divergence caused by gesture-irrelevant factors. Meanwhile, for multimodal gesture recognition, feature or score fusion in the final stage is a general choice to combine the information of different modalities. Consequently, the gesture-relevant features in different modalities may be redundant, whereas the complementarity of modalities is not exploited sufficiently. To handle these problems, we propose a hierarchical gesture prototype framework to highlight gesture-relevant features such as poses and motions in this article. This framework consists of a sample-level prototype and a modal-level prototype. The sample-level gesture prototype is established with the structure of a memory bank, which avoids the distraction of gesture-irrelevant factors in each sample, such as the illumination, background, and the performersâ appearances. Then the modal-level prototype is obtained via a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based subnetwork, in which the modal-invariant features are extracted and pulled together. Meanwhile, the modal-specific attribute features are used to synthesize the feature of other modalities, and the circulation of modality information helps to leverage their complementarity. Extensive experiments on three widely used gesture datasets demonstrate that our method is effective to highlight gesture-relevant features and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Point-voxel 3D object detectors have achieved impressive performance in complex traffic scenes. However, they utilize the 3D sparse convolution (spconv) layers with fixed receptive fields, such as voxel-based detectors, and inherit the fixed sphere radius from point-based methods for generating the features of keypoints, which make them weak in adaptively modeling various geometrical deformations and sizes of real objects. To tackle this issue, we propose a shape-adaptive set abstraction network (SASAN) for point-voxel 3D object detection. First, the proposal and offset generation module is adopted to learn the coordinates and confidences of 3D proposals and shape-adaptive offsets of the certain number of offset points for each voxel. Meanwhile, an extra offset supervision task is employed to guide the learning of shifting values of offset points, aiming at motivating the predicted offsets to preferably adapt to the various shapes of objects. Then, the shape-adaptive set abstraction module is proposed to extract multiscale keypoints features by grouping the neighboring offset pointsâ features, as well as features learned from adjacent raw points and the 2-D bird-view map. Finally, the region of interest (RoI)-grid proposal refinement module is used to aggregate the keypoints features for further proposal refinement and confidence prediction. Extensive experiments on the competitive KITTI 3D detection benchmark demonstrate that the proposed SASAN gains superior performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) fingerprint positioning technology has the benefits of affordable hardware and easy operation, making it a popular choice in the realm of indoor positioning. However, this technologyâs positioning accuracy tends to be on the meter scale, with room for further improvement. This paper proposes a novel indoor positioning method based on range limit weighted k nearest neighbours (SLWKNN) algorithm to improve the accuracy of indoor positioning. Firstly, in order to improve robustness to device heterogeneity, this paper designs a fusion distance that combines the Euclidean distance and the cosine distance, it integrates the spatial distance and signal pattern similarity of location fingerprints. Subsequently, to avoid the hassle of setting the k value manually, the adaptive k value is designed, it automatically determines the k value based on the maximum difference in fusion distance. Finally, to further filter location fingerprints, range limit is introduced, it determines whether to filter the location fingerprint by checking the distance between the location fingerprint collection location and the last predicted user location. Experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper surpasses conventional positioning methods across a range of indoor environments and exhibits higher performance.",

        "abstract": "Developing optimal bidding strategies for the market participants plays a crucial role in increasing the profit of the electricity market. For the complex double-sided auction market featured with partial observability, uncertainty and dynamic nature in the bidding transaction, current methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) based on single agent framework are difficult to model the strategic bidding behavior of both supply side and demand side with elastic demand. For this purpose, this paper proposes a multi-agent system based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), combined with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) mechanism, namely MADDPG-PER, to simulate the complex market environment. The multi-agent system based on MADDPG-PER is not only able to deal with the sparse reward gradient phenomenon for auction-based electricity market, but also can find superior bidding strategies for the market participants. The MADDPG-PER algorithm is evaluated on 9- bus and 30- bus congested network, where both supply and demand sides are modeled as RL agents. The results demonstrate that MADDPG-PER outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different level of system uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "Evolutionary multitasking algorithms use information exchange among individuals in a population to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously. Negative transfer is a critical factor that affects the performance of evolutionary multitasking algorithms. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to mitigate negative transfer in evolutionary multitasking algorithms. The proposed approach is grounded in rigorous theoretical analysis, which provides valuable theoretical insights into the design of an optimal linear crossover operator for mitigating negative transfer. By identifying interpretable conditions, we establish a solid theoretical foundation to prevent negative transfer in diverse scenarios. Building upon these findings, we theoretically derive a closed-form expression for the optimal crossover operator and propose practical design methods based on approximations. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed optimal crossover operator into a fundamental evolutionary multitasking algorithm framework. The resultant algorithm is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art methods. Empirical validation through comprehensive experiments confirms the effectiveness of our theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "De novo drug design speeds up drug discovery, mitigating its time and cost burdens with advanced computational methods. Previous work either insufficiently utilized the 3D geometric structure of the target proteins, or generated ligands in an order that was inconsistent with real physics. Here we propose an equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model, named DiffFBDD, for generating new pharmaceutical compounds based on 3D geometric information of specific target protein pockets. DiffFBDD overcomes the underutilization of geometric information by integrating full atomic information of pockets to backbone atoms using an equivariant graph neural network. Moreover, we develop a diffusion approach to generate drugs by generating ligand fragments for specific protein pockets, which requires fewer computational resources and less generation time (65.98%\nâ¼\n96.10% lower). DiffFBDD offers better performance than state-of-the-art models in generating ligands with strong binding affinity to specific protein pockets, while maintaining high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, with clear potential for exploring the drug-like chemical space.

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in reconnaissance missions due to their good maneuverability, low cost and high efficiency. When multiple UAVs complete reconnaissance tasks, they need accurate positioning and cooperation. In the case that some UAVs lack positioning equipment, cooperative reconnaissance of UAV groups in a certain spatial area can be realized. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of a novel combinatorial metaheuristic optimization method, named Combinatorial Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (CM RFO). This method uniquely combines the Hungarian algorithm from combinatorial optimization with the manta ray foraging optimization from metaheuristic optimization to systematically address collaborative task planning problems for multiple UAVs. According to the requirements of the cooperative reconnaissance task, a model is established that is divided into three stages: estimation of the optimal reconnaissance position of the UAV, estimation of the position of the UAV itself and reconnaissance subtask assignment. In the experiment, through the optimization results of particle swarm optimization, the Harris eagle algorithm and Manta ray foraging optimization in position estimation, the superiority of the Manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is demonstrated, and the Hungarian algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal distribution results of reconnaissance subtasks. We also show the completion process of the multi UAV cooperative reconnaissance task in some scenes where UAVs lack positioning equipment through graphical simulation and verify the proposed multiple unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance model",

        "abstract": "By using the intelligent edge computing technologies, a large number of computing tasks of end devices in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can be offloaded to edge servers, which can effectively alleviate the burden and enhance the performance of IIoT. However, in large-scale multi-service-oriented IIoT scenarios, offloading service resources are heterogeneous and offloading requirements are mutually exclusive and time-varying, which reduce the offloading efficiency. In this paper, we propose a cloud-edge-end collaboration intelligent service computation offloading scheme based on Digital Twin (DT) driven Edge Coalition Formation (DECF) approach to improve the offloading efficiency and the total utility of edge servers, respectively. Firstly, we establish a DT model to obtain accurate digital representations of heterogeneous end devices and network state parameters in dynamic and complex IIoT scenarios. The DT model can capture time-varying requirements in a low latency manner. Secondly, we formulate two optimization problems to maximize the offloading throughput and total system utility. Finally, we convert the multiobjective optimization problems to a Stackelberg coalition game model and develop a distributed coalition formation approach to balance the two optimizing objectives. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the nearest coalition scheme and non-coalition scheme, the proposed approach achieves offloading throughput improvements of 11.5% and 148%, and enhances the overall utility by 12% and 170%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "EEG emotion recognition is crucial in both human-machine interaction and healthcare. However, recognizing emotions across different subjects remains challenging due to individual variability. While existing multi-source domain adaptation methods have been utilized for cross-subject EEG emotion decoding, they often struggle with irrelevant or weakly relevant source domains, leading to negative transfer. Additionally, variations within subdomains are often neglected in these studies. We propose a joint domain adaptation method, Adaptive Source Joint Domain Adaptation (ASJDA) to address these issues. ASJDA utilizes an unsupervised adaptive source selection strategy to select a subset of source domains by evaluating the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the source and target domains, choosing those most relevant to the target. Subsequently, it implements joint domain adaptation with these chosen sources at both the domain and category subdomain levels. Our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving cross-subject accuracies of 96.81% in SEED, 89.69% in SEED-IV, and 69.31% in DEAP. This work significantly advances the state of the art in EEG emotion recognition by effectively addressing the challenges of cross-subject variability.

        "abstract": "Early action recognition endeavors to deduce the ongoing action by observing partial video, presenting a formidable challenge due to limited information available in the initial stages. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an innovative adversarial attention network based on generative adversarial networks. This network leverages the characteristics of both the generator and discriminator to generate unobserved action information from partial video input. The proposed method comprises a cross attention generator, self Attention discriminator, and feature fusion module. The cross attention generator captures temporal relationships in input action sequences, generating discriminative unobserved action information. The self attention discriminator adds global attention to the input sequence, capturing global context information for accurate evaluation of consistency in generated unobserved feature from cross attention generator. Finally, the feature fusion module helps the model obtain richer and more comprehensive feature representations. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Something-Something v2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods across different observation ratios. Detailed ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot single-view 3D reconstruction learns to reconstruct the novel category objects based on a query image and a few support shapes. However, since the query image and the support shapes are of different modalities, there is an inherent feature misalignment problem damaging the reconstruction. Previous works in the literature do not consider this problem. To this end, we propose the cross-modal feature alignment network (CMFAN) with two novel techniques. One is a strategy for model pretraining, namely, cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL), here the 2D images and 3D shapes of the same objects compose the positives, and those from different objects form the negatives. With CMCL, the model learns to embed the 2D and 3D modalities of the same object into a tight area in the feature space and push away those from different objects, thus effectively aligning the global cross-modal features. The other is cross-modal feature fusion (CMFF), which further aligns and fuses the local features. Specifically, it first re-represents the local features with the cross-attention operation, making the local features share more information. Then, CMFF generates a descriptor for the support features and attaches it to each local feature vector of the query image with dense concatenation. Moreover, CMFF can be applied to multilevel local features and brings further advantages. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our designs, and CMFAN sets new state-of-the-art performance in all of the 1-/10-/25-shot tasks of ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets.",

        "abstract": "Band selection (BS) is a critical method for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which helps to reduce the computational burden while providing a good class separability. However, most BS methods only deal with each HSI dataset independently, which cannot effectively exploit useful knowledge across multiple datasets. Only one BS method tries to transfer knowledge across multiple datasets, but it ignores the negative transfer effect caused by the inherent difference among datasets. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes an evolutionary multitasking BS method with adaptive cross-dataset knowledge transfer. Specifically, a new knowledge transfer strategy is designed based on the linear mapping to filter out irrelevant knowledge among different datasets. Then, an adaptive transfer control strategy is designed to adaptively adjust the frequency and intensity of knowledge transfer, which can further enhance the knowledge transfer performance. As validated by our experimental studies, our method can properly mitigate the negative transfer effect caused by the differences in cross-dataset knowledge transfer. When compared to several state-of-the-art BS methods on three common HSI datasets, our method can find superior band subsets with higher quality.",

However, this process often leads to the problem of error propagation and prevents cross-task information integration. To address this issue, we propose a novel transition-based model that performs nested entity recognition and relation extraction jointly without the need of word segmentation beforehand, which is achieved by leveraging the recent advance in using a lattice structure for Chinese sentence encodings. On standard ACE benchmarks, our model gives the best results in the literature. Further analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in capturing structural outputs.",

        "abstract": "Establishing network slices in line with the intent of particular applications through closed-loop automation represents a key goal on designing future advanced networks. However, the lack of association between application intents and network services imposes challenges to accurately capture user preference and generate customized network slices. This article introduces Intent-Oriented Network Slicing (IONS) based on hypergraph theory to realize the customization of application intents, while maximizing the utilization of network resources. Specifically, IONS introduces a cutting-edge hypergraph framework, utilizing scenarios and patterns as the foundational elements of its hyperedges, which can be further enhanced by creating a dynamic adaptive attention mechanism tailored to the hypergraphâs structure. Through this innovative approach, a sophisticated correlation model is established, linking application intents with network slicing strategies. This model significantly enhances the precision of user acquisition, optimizing network resources and user experience, while thus improving the customization of slice generation. Simulations demonstrate that the generated network slices can accurately reflect application intents.",

        "abstract": "Channel estimation is one of the main challenges for deploying the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, due to the large number of transmission and reflection channels. This letter proposes two channel estimation strategies for the STAR-RIS-assisted multi-user mmWave systems. Firstly, a sparse matrix recovery problem is proposed to estimate the cascaded channels, which comprise the channels from the base station to the STAR-RIS and from the STAR-RIS to the users. Subsequently, an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to exploit the sparsity and low-rank characteristics of mmWave channels, where the optimal solution of each variable can be computed analytically at each iteration. Additionally, a method based on parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition and the least-squares (LS) technique is proposed to estimate each channel separately. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes over existing ones.",

        "abstract": "State abstraction is a widely used technique in reinforcement learning (RL) that compresses the state space to accelerate learning algorithms. However, designing an effective abstraction function in large-scale or high-dimensional state space problems remains a significant challenge. In this brief, we present a novel state abstraction method based on deep supervised hash learning (DSH) and provide a theoretical analysis of its near-optimal property. Furthermore, by leveraging the DSH-based representation as the optimization objective, we propose a direct and concise optimization method based on the target value. In addition, we construct an auxiliary learning task for state abstraction that can be combined with various RL algorithms. In particular, we apply the DSH-based state abstraction to both deep $Q$ -learning (DQN) and soft actorâcritic (SAC). Extensive experiments are conducted on Atari and several classic control benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSH-based state abstraction method, showing that our method surpasses existing state abstraction algorithms in performance.",

        "abstract": "Camera-based stereo 3D object detection estimates 3D properties of objects with binocular images only, which is a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving. The state-of-the-art methods mainly improve the detection accuracy of general objects by designing ingenious stereo matching algorithms or complex pipeline modules. Moreover, additional fine-grained annotations, such as masks or LiDAR point clouds, are often introduced to deal with the occlusion problems, which brings in high manual costs for this task. To address the detection bottleneck caused by occlusion in a more cost-effective manner, we develop a novel stereo 3D object detection method named DSC3D, which achieves significant improvements for occluded objects without introducing additional supervision. Specifically, we first report the ambiguity in feature sampling, which refers to the presence of noisy features in the sampling for occluded objects. Then, we propose the Epipolar Constraint Deform-Attention (ECDA) module to address the unreliable left-right correspondence computation in stereo matching caused by occlusion, which reweights epipolar features by adaptively aggregating local neighbor information. Furthermore, to ensure that 3D property estimation is based on robust object features, we propose visible regions guided constraint to explicitly guide the offset learning for feature sampling. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI benchmark have demonstrated the proposed DSC3D outperforms the state-of-the-art camera-based methods.",

        "abstract": "Factorizing a low-rank matrix into two matrix factors with low dimensions from its noisy observations is a classical but challenging problem arising from real-world applications. This paper develops decentralized matrix factorization algorithms, i.e., factorizing a matrix whose columns are stored distributively over a network without a central agent. The performance of existing algorithms relies heavily on the accuracy of the matrix rank estimate. However, acquiring an accurate estimate is difficult in the distributed setting. In this paper and its Part II, we address this problem by introducing a novel regularization into the objective function to induce the solution with correct rank. Based on this, we propose a rank-adaptive decentralized MF algorithm. In Part I, we delineate the algorithm development from the centralized with known rank, decentralized with known rank, to the rank-adaptive decentralized settings. For the centralized algorithm, we present the first globally linear convergence analysis for the alternating gradient descent method. In the Part II, we analyze conditions for which the proposed rank-adaptive decentralized MF algorithm converges to the global solution with the correct rank. Numerical experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and corroborate the theoretical claims.",

To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Transformer-based Vnet framework (DT-VNet), which consists of a symmetric encoder-decoder architecture that explores global contextual features and retains local feature information. To effectively learn global and local features, We propose the Deep Union Transformer (DU-Trans) as an encoding base module for capturing comprehensive information. Additionally, we introduce a Pool Fusion Attention (PFA) module for decoding, which emphasizes learning context dependencies and interaction relationships. PFA can also facilitate the fusion of deep and shallow features. To our knowledge, this is the first study about deep transformer-based Vnet framework for prostate segmentation. We validate and compare our method on several public datasets against current state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in segmenting 3D prostate MRI.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of intelligent and networked technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) faces an escalating threat from cyberattacks, especially by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. These novel and complex attacks, characterized by their dynamic nature and life-long duration, pose significant challenges to existing security protection methods. The challenges are twofold, i.e., sparse reward problem in the long-lasting attack, and partial observation of attack actions. To this end, we propose a Security-as-a-Service based reinforcement learning method, namely Attention Augmented Dueling Deep Q-learning Network (AD2QN), to make real-time defense strategies for the hot standby IIoT. Firstly, we build the attack-defend confrontation model as black boxes interact with the IIoT environment to play a long-lasting partially observable zero-sum stochastic game on the server. Then, to dynamically generate optimal defense strategies as the service, AD2QN is proposed employing information completion and prediction to more informed action selection. Furthermore, AD2QN utilizes an iteratively updated reward network to deal with the sparse reward problem. Extensive simulation results shown that the defense strategies generated by our method have a higher defense success rate and a stable defense performance with the average success rate of 0.7384, while the average success rate of baseline methods was 0.7375, in the best case.",

        "abstract": "It is a widely recognized challenge to achieve independently steerable multiple beams using analog circuits. The generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrices have been proved capable of realizing multiple beams with flexible beam directions and low sidelobe levels. A major advantage of GJC matrix is that the phase shifters in each row are the same, thus facilitating easy and independent control of beams. In this paper, for the first time, a reconfigurable GJC matrix as a multibeam feed network is reported using planar circuits and verified experimentally. Beam steering is realized by a series of novel low-loss tunable reflection-type phase shifters, which are modelled and thoroughly analyzed. Based on the hybrid couplers and tunable phase shifters, a 2 Ã 8 reconfigurable GJC matrix is modeled and simulated using planar microstrip lines, and prototype is fabricated and tested. Low loss, excellent matching and continuous tuning phases with minimum phase error are obtained from simulation as well as measurements. Finally, the designed matrix is employed to feed a linear array for steering multiple beams. The realized beam patterns have successfully demonstrated that the designed reconfigurable GJC matrix is capable of independently controlling multiple beams simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "This letter presents a novel and high-performance reconfigurable true-time-delay (TTD) phase shifter. A compact dumbbell-shaped defected ground structure (DGS) is introduced to achieve a certain amount of TTD phase shift and low-transmission insertion loss. The p-i-n diode is used to control the on and off modes of the DGS unit. To enhance the impedance matching in both on and off modes, additional matching circuits are designed using microstrip stubs. Moreover, to realize a larger phase shift value, a six-unit DGS-reconfigurable TTD phase shifter is reported. The result reveals that the operating bandwidth ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 GHz, with a maximum phase shift of 120 $^{\\circ}$ and an insertion loss of less than 1 dB across the entire bandwidth. A prototype is simulated, fabricated, and successfully measured, and the measured results show excellent agreement with the simulation ones.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic conditions and internal states of portable energy storage system (PESS), such as temperature, electricity price, state of charge (SOC), and state of health (SOH), significantly impact battery degradation. Current decision-making models for PESS operation often oversimplify the modeling of battery degradation. To address this, we introduce an environment-adaptive online learning framework that effectively integrates deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to exploit and explore external environments (i.e., electricity prices and temperature) and internal dynamics (i.e., battery degradation), providing decision support for PESS operation. This framework dynamically updates battery degradation and decision-making models in real-time, enhancing adaptive responses to external changes. Specifically, we developed a neural network based on porous electrode theory that considers multi-physical factors, such as charging power, initial and terminal SOC, SOH, and temperature to accurately assess battery degradation. This network is embedded within a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling real-time, adaptive decision-making for PESS amidst varying environmental conditions. Furthermore, to navigate complex operational environments, a fine-tuning mechanism is incorporated into the degradation neural network. Application of this framework to the energy arbitrage of PESS in the California power grid demonstrates an average benefit increase of 37% compared to traditional degradation assessment models. Note to Practitioners âIn this work, we develop a novel approach to addressing the critical issue of battery degradation in PESS. Existing models often oversimplify degradation, hindering accurate assessments of performance and lifespan projections.

        "abstract": "Robustness, discrimination and security are essential characteristics of perceptual image hashing in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose two image hashing schemes based on block discrete wavelet transform (BDWT) to achieve these three characteristics. The basic scheme combines block discrete wavelet transform, singular value decomposition and statistics feature to extract the features of each overlapping image block. And chaotic cryptography is applied to encrypt these features. Furthermore, image correction is added to the basic scheme to realize a more comprehensive image hashing IC-BDWT, which can resist rotation attack. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments on 400 images from four public databases to analyze the proposed schemes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the experimental results demonstrates that the proposed hashing algorithms exhibit superior robustness and discrimination compared to the latest hashing algorithms under common content-preserving attacks. And the IC-BDWT hashing is far better than other algorithms in resisting rotation attack. Experimental results show that our schemes are secure and sensitive to secret keys.",

        "abstract": "The development of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is hindered by high costs associated with evaluating network architectures. Recently, several zero-cost proxies have been proposed as a promising method to reduce the evaluation cost of network architectures in NAS. They can quickly estimate the final performance of the network in a few seconds during the initial phase. However, existing zero-cost proxies either ignore the network structure's impact on performance or are limited to specific tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-cost proxy called Skeleton Path Kernel Trace (SPKT) that leverages the whole network architecture's skeleton path structure information. We then integrate it into an effective Bayesian optimization for NAS framework called PATNAS, and demonstrate its efficacy on different datasets. The results show that our proposed SPKT zero-cost proxy can achieve a high correlation with the final performance of the network across multiple tasks. Furthermore, it can significantly accelerate the search process for finding the best-performing network architectures.",

        "abstract": "The wide applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the low altitude urban airspace require the elaborate airspace conflict resolution mechanism. The online decentralized coordination method is the essential part of this mechanism. This paper proposes a novel classification model-based coordination method. Firstly, the collision cone-based safe separation constraints are studied and the decentralized conflict resolution problem is analyzed. Secondly, the right turn policy is proposed, that to establish the basic consensus of UAVs with regard to conflict resolution. Thirdly, the linearization conflict avoidance constraint is studied. The start angle that integrates the motion direction of each given UAV and the safe separation constraint of the relevant pairwise conflict is defined. The pairwise conflicts are classified as ordinary conflicts and singular conflicts according to the start angles of related UAVs. A comprehensive coordination method is proposed based on right turn policy and the classification model. We validate our approach on representative scenarios, and the results demonstrate that our novel method is beneficial in reducing the impact on the air traffic, and is capable of dealing with complex conflict scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The selection and utilization of different color spaces significantly impact the recognition performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks. Existing studies typically leverage image information from various color spaces through model integration or channel concatenation. However, these methods result in excessive model size and suboptimal utilization of image information. In this study, we propose the structure-preserved self-attention network (SPSANet) model for efficient fusion of image information from different color spaces. This model incorporates a novel structure-preserved self-attention (SPSA) module that employs a single-head pixel-wise attention mechanism, as opposed to the conventional multihead self-attention (MHSA) approach. Specifically, feature maps from all color space grouping paths are utilized for similarity matching, enabling the model to focus on critical pixel locations across different color spaces. This design mitigates the dependence of the SPSANet model on the choice of color space while enhancing the advantages of integrating multiple color spaces. The SPSANet model also employs channel shuffle operations to facilitate limited interaction between information flows from different color space paths. Experimental results demonstrate that the SPSANet model, utilizing eight common color spacesâRGB, Luv, XYZ, Lab, HSV, YCrCb, YUV, and HLSâachieves superior recognition performance with reduced parameters and computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Over the recent years, with the increasing adoption of Federated Learning (FL) algorithms and growing concerns over personal data privacy, Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. Practical PPFL typically allows multiple participants to individually train their machine learning models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a privacy-preserving manner. As such, Privacy-Preserving Aggregation (PPAgg) as the key protocol in PPFL has received substantial research interest. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on PPFL, where PPAgg is adopted to provide a privacy guarantee, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the PPAgg protocols applied in FL systems. This survey reviews the PPAgg protocols proposed to address privacy and security issues in FL systems. The focus is placed on the construction of PPAgg protocols with an extensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these selected PPAgg protocols and solutions. Additionally, we discuss the open-source FL frameworks that support PPAgg. Finally, we highlight significant challenges and future research directions for applying PPAgg to FL systems and the combination of PPAgg with other technologies for further security improvement.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning has been recently proposed for many clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model in a privacy-preserving manner. However, it also amplifies the difficulty in designing good neural network architecture, especially considering heterogeneous mobile devices. To this end, we propose a novel neural architecture search algorithm, namely FedNAS, which can automatically generate a set of optimal models under federated settings. The main idea is to decouple the two primary steps of the NAS process, i.e, model search and model training, and separately distribute them on the cloud and devices. It also tackles the primary challenge of limited on-device computational and communication resources through its novel designs: FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidate training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Evaluated on typical CNN architectures and large-scale datasets, FedNAS is able to achieve comparable model accuracy as a state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to 200_ or more compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS.",

        "abstract": "With the surge in various types of network traffic and the widespread application of encryption technology, the classification of encrypted traffic plays an increasingly important role in ensuring network security, enhancing quality of service, and managing network traffic. However, most existing methods often suffer from issues such as excessive reliance on manual feature extraction and expert knowledge, unstable classification performance, and lack of transfer learning capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a high-performance hybrid encrypted traffic classification framework, FERNN-AC. It directly extracts features from raw traffic and fully explores and utilizes the spatiotemporal information of traffic data by integrating specially designed feature enhancement module and temporal feature extraction module in a reasonable manner. It introduces angle constraints and can be combined with metalearning, thereby improving classification performance while possessing certain transfer learning capabilities. The experiments are conducted on three datasets, and the results shows that compare with relevant baseline methods, FERNN-AC has excellent and stable classification performance",

        "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection has been received growing interest in industrial and academic communities due to its substantial theoretical value and practical significance in reality. Recent advanced methods for time series anomaly detection are based on deep learning techniques, since they have shown their superiority in some specific situations. However, most existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods require predefined, specific tasks of reconstruction or prediction, necessitating task-specific loss functions. Designing such anomaly-aware loss functions poses a significant challenge due to the ambiguity in defining ground-truth anomalies. Moreover, these methods often rely on complex network architectures that tend to lead to over-generalization, resulting in even abnormal data being well reconstructed or fitted. To mitigate this situation, grounded in activation learning theory, we propose a novel unsupervised time series anomaly detection paradigm termed ALAD. ALAD utilizes a straightforward fully connected network architecture, measuring the typicality of input patterns through the sum of the squared output. Despite its simplicity, ALAD achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models trained using backpropagation. By utilizing various real-world and synthetic datasets, experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed paradigm. This work also demonstrates that biologically-plausible local learning can sometimes outperform backpropagation in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning is widely accepted as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training a shared global model across multiple client devices in a collaborative fashion. However, in practice, the significantly limited computational power on client devices has been a major barrier when we wish to train large models with potentially hundreds of millions of parameters. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, referred to as Infocomm , that incorporates locally supervised learning in federated learning. With locally supervised learning, the disadvantages of split learning can be avoided by using a more flexible way to offload training from resource constrained clients to a more capable server. Infocomm enables parallel training of different modules of the neural network in both the server and clients in a gradient-isolated fashion. The efficacy in reducing both training time and communication time is supported by our theoretical analysis and empirical results. In the scenario involving larger models and fewer available local data, Infocomm has been observed to reduce the elapsed time per round by over 37% without sacrificing accuracy compared to both conventional federated learning or directly combining federated learning and split learning, which showcases the advantages of Infocomm under power-constrained IoT scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose pFedMo, a personalized federated learning algorithm with contrastive momentum. In pFedMo, we design a score function to personalize worker models by distilling knowledge from the aggregator's representation model so as to address the non-i.i.d. issue. To accelerate the convergence, we leverage the momentum acceleration on both the worker side and the aggregator side. However, the typical momentum without personalization does not suit well for the worker models with personalization, influencing convergence performance. To address this, we develop a personalized/contrastive momentum method for efficient momentum acceleration. We provide mathematical proof for the convergence of pFedMo on non-i.i.d. data. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets and IoT system are conducted, verifying that pFedMo outperforms existing mainstream benchmarks, and achieves up to 35.90% accuracy increase and 3.64x training time speedup under a wide range of settings.",

        "abstract": "To determine the real-time changes in brain arousal introduced by anesthetics, Electroencephalogram (EEG) is often used as an objective neuroimaging evidence to link the neurobehavioral states of patients. However, EEG signals often suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio due to environmental noise and artifacts, which limits its application for a reliable estimation of depth of anesthesia (DoA), especially under high cross-subject variability. In this study, we propose an end-to-end deep learning based framework, termed as AnesFormer, which contains a data selection model, a self-attention based classification model, and a baseline update mechanism. These three components are integrated in a dynamic and seamless manner to achieve the goal of improving the effectiveness and robustness of DoA estimation in a leave-one-out setting. In the experiment, we apply the proposed framework to an office-based dataset and a hospital-based dataset, and use seven existing models as benchmarks. In addition, we conduct an ablation experiment to show the significance of each component in AnesFormer. Our main results indicate that 1) the proposed framework generally performs better than the existing methods for DoA estimation in terms of effectiveness and robustness; 2) each designed component in AnesFormer is likely to contribute to the DoA classification improvement.",

        "abstract": "Feature discretization can improve the processing efficiency of remote sensing big data. However, the distribution of target attribute values is often difficult to ascertain, and there are complex correlations between features, making it extremely difficult to obtain an optimal discretization scheme for remote sensing data. Although feature discretization methods based on evolutionary models can achieve some considerable results, it is difficult to formulate appropriate strategies without prior knowledge as guidance, which makes searching in multidimensional space inefficient and prone to falling into local optima. Therefore, we propose a genetic algorithm based on deep Q-learning (DQLGA) to optimize the discretization scheme of remote sensing data. First, we design a state set in the crossover and mutation stages by balancing the global and local search capabilities of genetic operators to obtain an accurate mapping of states in high-dimensional feature space. Then, we simulate the variation pattern of the optimal discretization scheme by analyzing the distribution of all individuals in the population during the evolution process to construct a reasonable adaptive reward function in reinforcement learning model. Finally, we introduce a pair of deep Q-networks with the same structure by treating the calculation of Q-values as a function fitting problem to fulfil an efficient updating of massive Q-values in state transition. We compare DQLGA with state-of-the-art feature discretization methods on remote sensing data. The experimental results indicate that DQLGA significantly improves the search efficiency of feature discretization methods based on evolutionary models, achieving higher classification accuracy while further reducing the number of breakpoints.",

        "abstract": "Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for studying the early development of the brain, as it allows to observe and analyze how the brain changes over time. Unfortunately, existing cohort research suffers from lacking sufficient MRI data for studying the development of fetal brains. Apart from research data, a viable alternative is the use of large-scale clinical fetal brain MRI data, which is currently the primary source for longitudinal studies. Although clinical data has several benefits, it is impeded by the inherent drawback of incomplete data. In the context of clinical practice, nearly all subjects undergo only one MRI scan throughout their entire pregnancy, resulting in a lack of longitudinal data for any fetus. To address this issue and obtain longitudinal clinical fetal brain MRI data, we propose to generate MR images for two adjacent gestational weeks (GWs) within one subject, thereby bridging the information gap between three consecutive GWs. This fetal MRI prediction task suffers from two significant challenges, including 1) heterogeneous generation and 2) the lack of paired training data at adjacent GWs. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a new approach, called the Development-driven Diffusion Model (DDM). Specifically, our approach first involves training a conditional diffusion model using population development information spanning all GWs. This allows the model to generate images at various GWs. Next, during the inference stage, we incorporate individual development information of a specific subject using a specially designed perception feature guidance module. The DDM enables the generated 3D MR images to encompass both the general characteristics representative of the targeted GWs, as well as the distinct feature specific to each individual. To assess the efficacy of our approach, extensive experiments were carried out on a large-scale clinical dataset obtained from three different medical centers. The experimental res...",

        "abstract": "The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enhances device smart decision-making, yet it also makes them more susceptible to cyber-attacks. AI-enabled Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) has been regarded as an effective way to mitigate such attacks. However, large-scale attacks data collection and labeling is prohibitively costly and time-consuming. Therefore, effective Few-Shot Learning based NIDS for IoT are crucial. Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks are widely used in generative few-shot learning but struggle with limited sample diversity and unstable training. Meanwhile, Deep Learning-based NIDS often lacks trustworthiness due to the \"black box\" problem. In response to these challenges, we propose a network traffic sample generation method that leverages the Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (CDDPM) to tackle the issues of samples. Then, we introduce an Intrusion Detection method named CNNBiGRU that combines Convolutional Neural Networks with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units based on the synthetic data generated by CDDPM. Furthermore, we apply the SHAP method to interpret the results to ensure model usersâ trust. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the two public datasets, which illustrate that our approach can successfully generates high-quality samples and improves the performance of NIDS.",

        "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has gradually become a research hotspot with extensive real-world applications. Differences in EEG signals across subjects usually lead to the unsatisfactory performance in subject-independent emotion recognition. To handle this challenge, many researchers have paid attention to the development of transfer learning techniques, which yield promising results. Currently, most researchers focus on transfer learning between subjects within one single dataset. However, cross-dataset transfer learning presents a great challenge, because, in this case, the data collected from different environments and equipments have much more severe variations. Domain Generalization (DG) has great potential to handle the unseen data without involving them in training. Besides, Knowledge Distillation (KD), which can transfer the knowledge learned from the teacher to the student model, has shown promise in generalization for the student model. Inspired by DG and KD, we propose a novel and effective method, Distillation-Based Domain Generalization (DBDG), for cross-dataset EEG-based emotion recognition. Specifically, DBDG contains the modules of feature extraction, online distillation and self-distillation. The feature extraction module can learn the discriminative emotional features from EEG signals; the online distillation and self-distillation modules can enhance the method generalizability. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets, SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for cross-dataset EEG-based emotion recognition.",

        "abstract": "Taking advantage of the natural grouping structure inside data, group sparse optimization can effectively improve the efficiency and stability of high-dimensional data analysis, and it has wide applications in a variety of fields such as machine learning, signal processing, and bioinformatics. Although there has been a lot of progress, it is still a challenge to construct a group sparse-inducing function with good properties and to identify significant groups. This article aims to address the group-sparsity-constrained minimization problem. We convert the problem to an equivalent weighted\nâ\np,q\n-norm (\np>0\n,\n0<qâ¤1\n) constrained optimization model, instead of its relaxation or approximation problem. Then, by applying the proximal gradient method, a solution method with theoretical convergence analysis is developed. Moreover, based on the properties proved in the Lagrangian dual framework, the homotopy technique is employed to cope with the parameter tuning task and to ensure that the output of the proposed homotopy algorithm is an\nL\n-stationary point of the original problem. The proposed weighted framework, with the central idea of identifying important groups, is compatible with a wide range of support set identification strategies, which can better meet the needs of different applications and improve the robustness of the model in practice. Both simulated and real data experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of group feature selection accuracy and computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results in application areas such as compressed sensing, image recognition, and classifier design show that our method has great potential in a wide range of applications.

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based models have revolutionized medical diagnostics by using Big Data to enhance disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, their significant computational demands and opaque decision making processes, often characterized as âblack-boxâ systems, pose major challenges in time-critical and resource constrained healthcare settings. To address these issues, this study explores the application of randomized machine learning models, specifically Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) networks, in medical diagnostics. These models introduce stochasticity into their training processes, reducing computational complexity and training times while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, we integrate Explainable AI techniques namely Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making rationale of ELMs and RVFL. Performance evaluations on genitourinary cancers and coronary artery disease datasets demonstrate that RVFL outperforms traditional deep learning models, achieving superioraccuracyof88.29%withacomputationaloverhead of 6.22 seconds for genitourinary cancers, and an accuracy of 81.64% with a computational time of 0.0308 seconds for coronary artery disease. This research highlights the potential of randomized models in enhancing efficiency and transparency in medical diagnosis, thereby accelerating better treatment outcomes and advocating for more accessible and interpretable AI solutions in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Recently, rumor detection (fake news detection) has seen a surge in research interest, and fact verification (fake news checking) has simultaneously become a significant research aspect. Despite the inherent distinction between fact verification and rumor detection â the former being a three-category task and the latter a binary one â there has yet to be in-depth exploration into the synergies between these two tasks. Furthermore, given the severe scarcity and the time-consuming and costly construction nature of fact verification datasets, few-shot/zeroshot fact verification methods are particularly favored. To tackle these challenges, we conduct a series of studies around âHow can rumor detection enhance few-shot fact verification, and to what extent?â. Specifically, we systematically investigate the knowledge transferability between the two tasks, proposing a framework, Det2Ver, that is applicable to both rumor detection and fact verification. Through the construction of adaptive prompt templates and prompt-tuned LLMs like T5, Det2Ver structurallevel synchronizes the two tasks and utilizes the external knowledge from rumor detection to reinforce fact verification task. We demonstrate the significance and effectiveness of Det2Ver. Through the few-shot/zero-shot experiments on three widelyused datasets, compared to other LLMs prompt-tuning baselines, the Det2Ver for cross-task knowledge augmentation brings a significant improvement in macro-F1 for fact verification",

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has been playing an essential role in machine learning since it can obtain a large number of labels in an economical and fast manner for training increasingly complex learning models. However, the application of crowdsourcing learning still faces several challenges such as the low quality of crowd labels and the urgent requirement for learning models adapting to the label noises. There have been many studies focusing on truth inference algorithms to improve the quality of labels obtained by crowdsourcing. Comparably, end-to-end predictive model learning in crowdsourcing scenarios, especially using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, is still in its infant stage. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network-based framework, namely CGNNAT, which models the correlation of instances by combining the GCN model with an attention mechanism to learn more representative node embeddings for a better understanding of the bias tendency of crowd workers. Furthermore, a specific projection processing layer is employed in CGNNAT to model the reliability of each crowd worker, which makes the model an end-to-end neural network directly trained by noisy crowd labels. Experimental results on several real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed CGNNAT outperforms state-of-the-art and classical methods in terms of label prediction.",

        "abstract": "Social network alignment aims to discover the potential correspondence between users across different social platforms. Recent advances in graph representation learning have brought a new upsurge to network alignment. Most existing representation-based methods extract local structural information of social networks from users' neighborhoods, but the global structural information has not been fully exploited. Therefore, this manuscript proposes a dual graph convolutional networks-based method (DualNA) for social network alignment, which combines user representation learning and user alignment in a unified framework. Specifically, we design dual graph convolutional networks as feature extractors to capture the local and global structural information of social networks, and apply a two-part constraint mechanism, including reconstruction loss and contrastive loss, to jointly optimize the graph representation learning process. As a result, the learned user representations can not only preserve the local and global features of original networks, but also be distinguishable and suitable for the downstream task of social network alignment. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms all baselines. The ablation studies further illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "In multivariate time series prediction tasks, the inter- and intra-variable relations have significant influence on prediction outcomes. In many engineering and industrial scenarios, the multivariate time series also contain a large number of subjective influencing factors such as settings and behaviors of users. Existing learning methods neglect the interactions of these subjective factors among variables. This leads to the learning of incorrect inter-variable influences, consequently yielding inaccurate prediction results. To address this challenge, we propose a Decoupled Casal Attention Network (DECA) for multivariate time series prediction from a spatiotemporal learning perspective. multivariate time series prediction. The causality decoupling module, based on the captured causal relations among variables, disentangles the subjective factors from the objective factors. Then the objective learning module utilizes an objective causal attention to capture objective cross-variable dependencies; while the subjective learning module utilizes a subjective causal graph attention to capture subjective influences. Finally, the prediction module fuses the multi-scale features of subjective and objective factors to produce predictions. The performance is evaluated using three benchmark datasets. Results indicate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, DECA exhibits superior accuracy in multivariate time series prediction and can be effectively used for recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Model updates are exchanged between server(s) and participants in Federated Learning (FL), which can result in excessive delay, especially for large models. Existing communication-efficient FL approaches such as quantization and top-k sampling apply compression to gradients assuming that gradients are sparse and can tolerate small deviations. This can hardly be applied to down-link transmission. In this work, we employ compressive sensing on model parameters instead of gradients and propose a two-way adaptive compression scheme, Cepe-FL, which exploits dictionary learning to project non-sparse model parameters into sparse representations to ensure reconstruction accuracy. Cepe-FL supports joint model reconstruction with drastic reduction in computational complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ . Cepe-FL adjusts the compression ratio adaptively according to the training loss, achieving the best trade-off between communication and model precision. Furthermore, it demonstrates efficacy in defending against membership inference attacks since only compressed models are exchanged. We conduct extensive experiments on three image classification tasks and compare with three communication-efficient approaches including FedPAQ, FedAvg and T-FedAvg. Cepe-FL presents the best performance in all tasks under IID and non-IID scenarios. We also implement white-box membership inference attacks, and the results show Cepe-FL can significantly suppress success ratio of inference in comparison with other approaches.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of optimal neural network architectures is foundational to the progression of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, the existing NAS methods suffer from the following problem using traditional search strategies, i.e., when facing a large and complex search space, it is difficult to mine more effective architectures within a reasonable time, resulting in inferior search results. This research introduces the Generative Pre-trained Transformer NAS (GPT-NAS), an innovative approach designed to overcome the limitations which are inherent in traditional NAS strategies. This approach improves search efficiency and obtains better architectures by integrating GPT model into the search process. Specifically, we design a reconstruction strategy that utilizes the trained GPT to reorganize the architectures obtained from the search. In addition, to equip the GPT model with the design capabilities of neural architecture, we propose the use of the GPT model for training on a neural architecture dataset. For each architecture, the structural information of its previous layers is utilized to predict the next layer of structure, iteratively traversing the entire architecture. In this way, the GPT model can efficiently learn the key features required for neural architectures. Extensive experimental validation shows that our GPT-NAS approach beats both manually constructed neural architectures and automatically generated architectures by NAS. In addition, we validate the superiority of introducing the GPT model in several ways, and find that the accuracy of the neural architecture on the image dataset obtained from the search after introducing the GPT model is improved by up to about 9%.",

        "abstract": "Information diffusion and diffusion prediction have attracted a great deal of research attention over the past decades. Existing approaches usually make predictions based on the order of the activated users, while recently, some studies have taken the social network into consideration and begun to analyze the influence of neighbors via some graph neural networks. However, they ignore the fact that the interests of users and their neighbors may dynamically change along with the growth of the cascade, and thus fail to model the potential impact of activated users. To address the above shortcomings, we proposed in this paper a deep learning model that combines the M ode of cascades G rowth and potential I mpact of users (MGI). It leverages GCNs to represent users from the social network to model their static features. Besides, we designed an attention mechanism on the cascade sequence to compute features of activated users, and added the popularity variable to model features of users in cascades. Finally, we combined the growth of cascades and impact of users in our model for diffusion prediction. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in diffusion prediction.",

        "abstract": "Understanding mobile application usage patterns is significant for producing better services and enriching user experience. The understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of application usage is still limited. In this paper, we aim at finding spatiotemporal mobile app usage patterns and propose a framework to capture who, when, where, and what applications are used. We first collect a large-scale and real-world application usage dataset covering over 400 thousand active users and 600 million records. In order to introduce spatial features, we partition the collection area into small regions. By grouping regions of similar point-of-interest attributes, we then map 796 regions onto 13 region clusters with semantic meanings. As a result, the original data is reformed as a tensor of four dimensions, i.e., users, application categories, region clusters, and time-slots. We then leverage a multi-way clustering algorithm on the tensor to extract coupling relations between different dimensions. Finally, we discover 508 distinct spatiotemporal application usage patterns with meaningful labels, including E- readers, Digital payers, Uber/DiDi drivers, Young parents, Travellers and Travel planners. The results produced by our framework can serve a series of applications, e.g., identifying user habits and inferring user demographics, which are helpful in customized services like personalized recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Accurate entity and relation analysis are crucial for enhancing the user experience of consumer electronics products with integrated social media capabilities. An open gap in this research field is that existing approaches present lower predictive performance due to information conflicts and mismatch among multimodal data. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for multimodal entity recognition and relation extraction, which combines the power of data discrimination and dynamic gating fusion with deep spatiotemporal learning. The idea is to infer inherent relationships between co-occurring entities by overcoming the limitations of multimodal mismatch and parallel task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms advanced approaches on three benchmark datasets, signifying a major performance enhancement due to the effective integration of visual and textual information. Ablation experiments and case studies further demonstrate the potential of the architecture to improve the intelligent social media capabilities of consumer electronics.

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communication has emerged as a powerful technology for reliable and flexible emergency communications (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes and floods), especially when the mobile infrastructure is seriously damaged. UAV assisted mobile edge computing (UAV-MEC) system can be deployed in the natural disaster area as communication relay or air mobile base stations to resume communication and provide computing resources for the users in disaster areas. However, the optimized resource allocation performance of UAV-MEC system can be further guaranteed with the human-fusion decision making. In this paper, we construct an emergency human-machine fusion UAV-MEC system consisting of multiple UAVs equipped with computing resources, and the human-machine decision makings are fused for UAV deployment. In order to solve the resource allocation problem of human-machine fusion UAV-MEC system, we establish an human-machine deep integration model for UAV-MEC system, and the UAVs are dispatched reasonably through human-machine fusion decision makings to maintain efficient communication in emergency communication areas. To minimize task latency and improve the computation efficiency in emergency human-machine fusion UAV-MEC system, we consider the number of dispatched UAVs, deployment plans, flight plans, and simultaneously optimize the task allocation scheme, priority order, and task offloading ratio. We propose a reinforcement learning framework combined with evolutionary algorithms, which is named as multi-agent Q-net enhanced cooperative genetic algorithm (MQCGA), for resource allocation of UAV. Based on neural network forecasts, the greedy rate during training processing can be dynamically controlled, and the learning ability of different agents can be strengthened. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework, and the results show that our proposed MQCGA algorithm is significantly superior to other algorithms in terms of...",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm shows great potential as an effective tool for target tracking through completing complex tasks by collaboration of heterogeneous UAVs. However, UAV swarm scheduling faces challenges with poor quality communication and obstacles, especially in communication denial environment with multiple obstacles. To overcome these challenges, first, this paper proposes a scheduling slot model which divides the scheduling process into multiple time slots, allowing UAVs to communicate in communication slots while predicting instead of communication in communication denial slots. In communication denial slots, this model utilizes route fitting and two-stage Kalman filtering for UAV location prediction and optimizes UAV scheduling to align with predicted positions. In enabled slots, this model corrects position deviations to obtain precise UAV locations manually. Then, we propose an obstacle avoidance strategy to facilitate swarm scheduling for target searching under communication constraints. The obstacle avoidance strategy simplifies obstacles as regular hexagons and facilitates the determination of UAV avoidance routes by introducing intermediary points. Finally, to optimize UAV scheduling strategy, we propose a region co-evolution algorithm (RCEA), which emphasizes the collaboration among diverse individuals or populations. RCEA adopts area evaluation and Pareto strategy to enhance scheduling efficiency with following three steps. RCEA divides the overall scheduling region into multiple sub-regions, generates the foundational solution pool through the implementation of the area evaluation or Pareto strategy, and then proceeds to execute the region cooperation process base on the foundational solution pool. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the performance of human-UAV interaction scheduling model with proposed scheduling methods and obstacle avoidance strategy. The simulation results demonstrate that RCEA outperforms other sched...",

        "abstract": "Protein interactions constitute the fundamental building block of almost every life activity. Identifying protein communities from Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks is essential to understand the principles of cellular organization and explore the causes of various diseases. It is critical to integrate multiple data resources to identify reliable protein communities that have biological significance and improve the performance of community detection methods for large-scale PPI networks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-source Learning based Protein Community Detection (MLPCD) algorithm by integrating Gene Expression Data (GED) and a parallel solution of MLPCD using cloud computing technology. GED under different conditions is integrated with the original PPI network to reconstruct a Weighted-PPI network. To flexibly identify protein communities of different scales, we define community modularity and functional cohesion measurements and detect protein communities from WPPI. In addition, we compare the detected communities with known protein complexes and evaluate the function enrichment of protein functional modules using Gene Ontology annotations. We implement a parallel version of MLPCD on the Apache Spark platform to enhance the performance of the algorithm. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority and notable advantages of the MLPCD algorithm over the relevant algorithms in terms of accuracy and performance.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile computing and the popularity of mobile devices equipped with GPS technology, massive spatial data have become available. Enterprises upload encrypted spatial data to the mobile cloud to save local storage and computation costs. However, the existing secure Geometric Range Search (GRS) solutions are inefficient in terms of building, updating index structure and querying processes. Moreover, the index structures of existing GRS schemes based on Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) leak location order, which may lead to reconstruction attacks. To solve these issues, we first propose an efficient and secure GRS scheme using Radix-Tree, namely GRSRT-I. Specifically, we construct an index structure based on Radix-tree to achieve efficient search and update, then use homomorphic encryption NTRU to resist chosen-plaintext attack, finally design a dual-server architecture to alleviate the burdens on mobile users caused by multiple rounds of interactions. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced scheme, GRSRT-II, by combining Order-Revealing Encryption and OPE, which greatly improves the search efficiency while slightly reducing the security. We formally prove the security of our proposed schemes, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that GRSRT-I can improve the query efficiency by up to at least 1.5 times when compared with previous solutions and GRSRT-II can achieve a higher level of search efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In some applications, edge learning is experiencing a shift in focusing from conventional learning from scratch to new two-stage learning unifying pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning. This paper considers the problem of joint communication and computation resource management in a two-stage edge learning system. In this system, model pre-training is first conducted at an edge server via centralized learning on local pre-stored general data, and then task-specific fine-tuning is performed at edge devices based on the pre-trained model via federated edge learning. For the two-stage learning model, we first analyze the convergence behavior (in terms of the average squared gradient norm bound), which characterizes the impacts of various system parameters such as the number of learning rounds and batch sizes in the two stages on the convergence rate. Based on our analytical results, we then propose a joint communication and computation resource management design to minimize an average squared gradient norm bound, subject to constraints on the transmit power, overall system energy consumption, and training delay. The decision variables include the number of learning rounds, batch sizes, clock frequencies, and transmit power control for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design. It is shown that the proposed joint resource management over the pre-training and fine-tuning stages well balances the system performance trade-off among the training accuracy, delay, and energy consumption. The proposed design is also shown to effectively leverage the inherent trade-off between pre-training and fine-tuning, which arises from the differences in data distribution between pre-stored general data versus real-time task-specific data, thus efficiently optimizing overall system performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised TTS framework, QS-TTS, to improve TTS quality with lower supervised data requirements via Vector-Quantized Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning (VQ-S3RL) utilizing more unlabeled speech audio. This framework comprises two VQ-S3R learners: first, the principal learner aims to provide a generative Multi-Stage Multi-Codebook (MSMC) VQ-S3R via the MSMC-VQ-GAN combined with the contrastive S3RL, while decoding it back to the high-quality audio; then, the associate learner further abstracts the MSMC representation into a highly-compact VQ representation through a VQ-VAE. These two generative VQ-S3R learners provide profitable speech representations and pre-trained models for TTS, significantly improving synthesis quality with the lower requirement for supervised data. QS-TTS is evaluated comprehensively under various scenarios via subjective and objective tests in experiments. The results powerfully demonstrate the superior performance of QS-TTS, winning the highest MOS over supervised or semi-supervised baseline TTS approaches, especially in low-resource scenarios. Moreover, comparing various speech representations and transfer learning methods in TTS further validates the notable improvement of the proposed VQ-S3RL to TTS, showing the best audio quality and intelligibility metrics. The trend of slower decay in the synthesis quality of QS-TTS with decreasing supervised data further highlights its lower requirements for supervised data, indicating its great potential in low-resource scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Graph data analysis has been used in various real-world applications to improve services or scientific research, which, however, may expose sensitive personal information. Differential privacy (DP) has become the gold standard for publishing graph data while still protecting personal privacy. However, most existing studies over differentially private graph data publication mainly focus on static unweighted graphs. As interactions between entities in real systems are often dynamically changing and associated with weights, it is desirable to consider the more general scenario of continuous weighted graph publication under DP in the temporal dimension. Therefore, we investigate the problem of publishing weighted graphs satisfying DP under continuous monitoring. Specifically, we consider a server that continuously monitors user data and publishes a sequence of weighted graph snapshots. We propose SwgDP, a novel framework that leverages historical graph data to guide current snapshot generation. SwgDP consists of four key components: node adaptive sampling, dynamic weight optimization, prediction-based community detection and weighted graph generation. We demonstrate that SwgDP satisfies DP, and comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets and four commonly used graph metrics show that SwgDP can effectively synthesize weighted graph at any time step.",

        "abstract": "The surge in visual general big data has notably advanced data-driven deep learning-based computer vision technologies. Transformer-based methods shine in this era of big data because of their attention mechanism architecture and demand for massive data. However, the difficulty of obtaining medical images has caused the field to continue facing the limited-data challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neuro-fuzzy system named Fuzzy-ViT, which synergistically integrates fuzzy logic with the Vision Transformer (ViT) for cross-domain transfer learning from large-scale general data to medical image domain. Specifically, Fuzzy-ViT utilizes a ViT backbone pre-trained on extensive general datasets such as ImageNet-21K, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B to extract rich general features. Then, a Fuzzy Attention Cross-Domain Module (FACM) is presented to transfer general features to medical features, thereby enhancing the medical image analysis. Thanks to the Fuzzy System Transitioner (FST) in FACM, fuzzy and uninterpretable general domain features can be effectively converted into those needed in the medical domain. In addition, the Attention Mechanism Smoother (AMS) in FACM smoothes the conversion outcomes, ensuring a harmonious integration of the fuzzy system with the neural network architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy-ViT achieves state-of-the-art and satisfactory performance on popular medical image benchmarks (BreakHis and HCRF) with 93.37% and 97.22% F1 scores. Detailed ablation analysis demonstrates that the effectiveness of our method for bridging large general visual and medical images.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of cloud computing has spurred the popularity of storing and querying databases in the cloud. Among others, skyline queries play an important role in the database field due to its usefulness in multi-criteria decision support systems. To accommodate the tailored needs of users, user-defined skyline query has recently emerged, allowing users to define custom preferences in their skyline queries. However, user-defined skyline query services, if deployed in the cloud, may raise critical privacy concerns as the outsourced databases and skyline queries may contain proprietary/privacy-sensitive information. In light of the above, this paper presents ObliuSky, a new solution enabling oblivious user-defined skyline query processing in the cloud. ObliuSky departs from prior work by not only providing confidentiality protection for the content of the outsourced database, the user-defined skyline queries, and the query results, but also hiding the data patterns (e.g., user-defined dominance relations among database points and search access patterns) which may indirectly cause data leakages. We formally analyze the security guarantees and conduct extensive performance evaluations. The results show that while achieving much stronger security guarantees than the state-of-the-art prior work, ObliuSky is superior in database and query encryption efficiency, and scalable in oblivious query processing.",

        "abstract": "Most of the current federated learning schemes aimed at safeguarding privacy exhibit vulnerability to collusion attacks and lack a verification mechanism for participants to consolidate the aggregation results of the parameter server, leading to privacy breaches for users and inaccurate model training outcomes. In order to address these issues, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving federated learning framework against collusion attacks. Primarily, the federated learning scheme is reconfigured utilizing the ElGamal encryption algorithm, which effectively safeguards the data privacy of participants in scenarios involving collusion between certain participants and servers. Additionally, the introduction of the assistant server can realize the joint decryption of the gradient ciphertext by the non-collusive parameter server and assistant server, which can effectively resist the internal attack of a single parameter server model in the process of data upload. Thirdly, this scheme designs a verification mechanism that enables participants to effectively verify the accuracy and integrality of the parameter server's aggregated results, preventing the parameter server from returning incorrect aggregation results to participants. Experimental results and performance analysis demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only fortifies security measures but also upholds the precision of model training, surpassing the security and correctness of many existing methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Accurately predicting nearby agents' future trajectories is fundamental for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. However, existing learning-based trajectory prediction models struggle with poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes, potentially leading to failed predictions in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce IMGTP, a unified framework for systematically evaluating, improving, and measuring the generalization performance of trajectory prediction models in OOD scenes. IMGTP consists of three primary components: the Argoverse-Shift dataset, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy, and an approach for OOD measurement. First, the Argoverse-Shift is a cross-domain dataset that highlights the significant differences in data distributions across domains, serving as a testing platform for models' generalization ability. Second, the FrenÃÂ©t+ strategy leverages map centerlines and the FrenÃÂ©t Frame to enhance the generalizability of baseline models by mitigating the domain gap resulting from road geometry variations. Third, we provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology for OOD measurement, quantifying the range of data that can be effectively handled by prediction models. This measurement approach employs the accuracy rate of the correctly predicted samples and their corresponding mean distance as well as standard deviation to the training set center as indicators of the model's generalization ability. The mean distance also serves as a valid criterion for OOD detection and uncertainty quantification. Experimental results demonstrate that our IMGTP framework enhances the generalization capability of mainstream trajectory prediction models by substantially improving their prediction performance in unseen domains. This advancement contributes to developing more robust and safer prediction models for autonomous driving in the real world.

        "abstract": "Deep learning provides an intelligent analytical approach for Big Data analysis and feature extraction in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, due to concerns about data security and privacy disclosure, conventional data-centralized deep learning often faces difficulties about data famine and data islands. Federated learning (FL) as a novel privacy-preserving deep learning paradigm breaks the data islands among different smart factories by sharing their model parameters instead of raw data, which essentially solves the data famine problem for training a high-quality deep learning model. Nevertheless, exchanging numerous model parameters not only generates considerable communication overhead but also poses the risk of privacy information disclosure hidden in model parameters due to inference attacks launched by external attackers or honest-but-curious servers. The purpose of this article is to build a high-quality trustworthy FL architecture dubbed TrustFedGRU for IIoT while alleviating the communication overhead. First, a multikey decryption assisted privacy-preserving homomorphic encryption scheme is proposed in FL to meet the distinct privacy-preserving requirements of different data owners without impairing model performance. Furthermore, tensor decomposition is leveraged to convert the weight tensor of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) into a low-rank approximation, so as to reduce the communication bandwidth overhead and decrease the storage requirements. Meanwhile, a novel dynamic update-based FL approach is investigated to improve the model performance. The experimental results show that the proposed TrustFedGRU greatly reduces the communication overhead while guaranteeing the model performance and security.",

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve recognition rate in license plate to improve traffic. However, these methods may refer to big computational costs and a lot of parameters. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation with a fast CNN for license plate detection (KDNet). KDNet uses knowledge distillation to guide a CNN to optimize parameters and quickly obtain a detector for license plate. To overcome naive effect of local information, a non-local similarity mechanism is used into a CNN to enhance effect of global information for extracting salient information in license plate detection. Experimental results that this proposed KDNet is superior to detection speed for license plate. The code of KDNet can be obtained at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/KDNet .",

        "abstract": "A series of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed for expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs), building cheap surrogate models to replace the expensive real function evaluations. However, the search efficiency of these SAEAs is not yet satisfactory. More efforts are needed to further exploit useful information from the real function evaluations in order to better guide the search process. Facing this challenge, this paper proposes a Hyperbolic Neural Network (HNN) based preselection operator to accelerate the optimization process based on limited evaluated solutions. First, the preselection task is modeled as a multi-label classification problem where solutions are classified into different layers (ordinal categories) through -relaxed objective aggregation. Second, in order to resemble the hierarchical structure of candidate solutions, a hyperbolic neural network is applied to tackle the multi-label classification problem. The reason for using HNN is that hyperbolic spaces more closely resemble hierarchical structures than Euclidean spaces. Moreover, to alleviate the data deficiency issue, a data augmentation strategy is employed for training the HNN. In order to evaluate its performance, the proposed HNN-based preselection operator is embedded into two surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results on two benchmark test suites and three real-world problems with up to 11 objectives and 150 decision variables involving seven state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The insecurities of public-key infrastructure on the Internet have been the focus of research for over a decade. The extensive presence of broken, weak, and vulnerable cryptographic keys has been repeatedly emphasized by many studies. Analyzing the security implications of cryptographic keysâ vulnerabilities, several studies noted the presence of public key reuse. While the phenomenon of private key sharing was extensively studied, the prevalence of public key sharing on the Internet remains largely unknown. In this work, we perform a large-scale analysis of public key reuse within the PKI ecosystem. We investigate the presence and distribution of duplicate X.509 certificates and reused RSA public keys across a large collection containing over 314 million certificates and over 13 million SSH keys collected by different sources at different times. We analyze the cryptographic weaknesses of duplicate certificates and reused keys and investigate the reasons and sources of reuse. Our results reveal that certificate and key sharing are common and persistent. Our findings show over 10 million certificates and 17 million public keys are reused across time and shared between our collections. We observe keys with non-compliant cryptographic elements stay available for an extended period of time.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to facilitate learning tasks within an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled information from the source domain. To address the domain discrepancy, the majority of existing methods focus on learning latent features in both the source and target domains. However, the essential challenge in unsupervised domain adaptation lies in locating labeled information, specifically the true labels of the data, within the target domain. In this paper, we propose a unified prompt-tuning framework that converts cross-domain classification into few-shot learning, effectively integrating diverse cross-domain classification tasks into an iterative few-shot learning paradigm. The framework unifies all predicted pseudo labels, templates, and iterated models into a cohesive prompt-tuning model, exhibiting robust scalability for integrating other tuning modalities and offering high availability to minimize the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on several well-known benchmark datasets, we validate the superior performance of our framework compared to other domain adaptation and fine-tuning PLMs methods, which achieves up to an impressive 99% predicting accuracy of true labels within the target domain.",

        "abstract": "The LEO satellite data center (LSDC) is becoming a key application paradigm for the future satellite Internet with global information fusion and big data analysis, which consists of numerous satellite storage nodes forming distributed storage systems. Satellite on-board disks inevitably fail due to space radiation and battery depletion, resulting in data loss. Erasure coding (EC) can guarantee data reliability at the expense of heavy repair traffic. To mitigate this challenge, multiple repair data flows can be aggregated progressively into a single data flow during transmission based on the reconstruction matrix of EC. This repair mechanism of storage-transmission integration can effectively accelerate data repair. In this paper, we employ storage-transmission integration to LSDC and propose the erasure coding aggregation repair (ECAR). Firstly, ECAR models repair data flows in LSDC as a staged tree graph, called multi-weight path tree (MWPT). The edge weights in MWPT are metricized by multiple factors affecting the repair performance, including transmission time, propagation delay and energy cost. Then, we give a delay-sensitive energy-efficient MWPT (DEMWPT) construction method for single stripe repair, which reduces the energy cost while guaranteeing the minimum repair delay. We also propose the pipeline erasure coding aggregation repair (PECAR) for multiple stripe repair, which further reduces the repair delay by decentralizing the stripe synchronization process to aggregation nodes. Finally, we design a storagetransmission integrated simulation platform for LSDC and deploy the prototype of MWPT in it. The experimental results show that DE-MWPT can reduce the repair delay by 7.3% and energy cost by 6% compared with the existing aggregation repair policies, while PECAR can further reduce the repair delay by 43.9% compared to its ECAR counterpart",

        "abstract": "Driving behavior safety analysis in edge computing involves the real-time collection and processing of vehicle driving data. Fuzzy models have advantages in analyzing driving behavior due to their excellent ability to handle uncertain information. This study develops a multitask discriminative Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model (MD-TS-FM) for driving behavior safety assessment. To comprehensively analyze the correlation and differences in multitask driving behaviors, the designed consequent part consists of two parts: task-shared part reflects the shared intrinsic structure information that are consistent across different driving tasks, and task-specific part reflects distinct characteristics and variations specific to each task, allowing the model to address the unique aspects of different driving behaviors. Accordingly, the task-shared consequent part is characterized by low-rank property, which mines global structural information within the fuzzy space; whereas the task-specific consequent part exhibits sparsity, which removes non-discriminative and irrelevant information. This sparsity ensures that the model focuses on the most critical features for each specific task. Furthermore, a discriminative diversity term is introduced to enhance the diversity between tasks, which explores the consistent information of task-shared consequents while reducing the overlap of task-specific consequents. Experimental results indicate that the MD-TS-FM model can be effectively applied to driving behavior safety assessment.",

        "abstract": "Communication and energy efficiencies are two crucial objectives in the pursuit of edge intelligence in 6G networks, and become increasingly important given the prevalence of large model training. Existing designs typically focus on either communication efficiency or energy efficiency due to the fact that improving one objective generally comes at the expense of the other. Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance both efficiencies through an integrated communication and computation design. Nevertheless, most previous studies on OTA-FL only consider scenarios where the dataset for the entire FL procedure is collected and available prior to training. In real-world applications, devices continuously collect new data in an online manner. This underscores the significance of sample collection through sensing in a practical FL pipeline. We propose to integrate sensing with communication and computation into a joint design to further boost the communication-and-energy efficiencies of OTA-FL. Specifically, we consider a training latency and energy consumption minimization problem with performance guarantees. To this end, we first derive an average training error (ATE) metric to quantify convergence performance. Then, a joint sensing, communication and computation resource allocation strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that nests convex optimization with a deep Q-network. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design for communication-and-energy efficient FL.",

        "abstract": "Federated Edge Learning (FEL) is regarded as a promising distributed machine learning paradigm to reduce transmission latency and resources as well as preserve raw data privacy by collaboratively training local deep learning models across multiple edge devices. However, with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, the size of neural network models grows exponentially with their parameters to meet variable application requirements, which poses significant challenges to the computation, communication, and memory abilities of edge devices. Existing designs typically focus on either communication or computation efficiency without caring each deviceâs memory ability. To deal with the above issues, we first introduce a novel model sparse update enabled Tiny Federated Edge Learning (TinyFEL) architecture, which terminates the back-propagation early in local model training processes. Therefore, the proposed TinyFEL can reduce local memory occupation and lessen the communication-and-computation burden. Furthermore, we propose a parameter splitting mechanism instead of transmitting the full model, only a part of updated layers of parameters is transmitted for aggregation, which significantly reduced the communication overheads. Thereafter, we develop a communication and computation latency minimization problem to accelerate the training of TinyFEL. To this end, we theoretically analyze the convergence performance of TinyFEL, which unveils the mathematical relationship among sparse update ratio assignment, device selection, and learning performance. Then, a joint sparse update ratio assignment, device selection, and resource allocation strategy is introduced based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithms. Numerical results indicate that our proposed TinyFEL can reduce training memory occupation by over 40% than the traditional FEL at the cost of negligible accuracy loss.",

        "abstract": "Exploring disease mechanisms at the lncRNA level provides valuable guidance for disease prognosis and treatment. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in exploring disease mechanisms via computational methods to overcome the challenge of tremendous manpower and material resources in biological experiments. However, current computational methods suffer from two main limitations: simple data structures that do not consider the close association between multiple types of data, and the lack of a systematic pathogenesis analysis that identified disease-associated lncRNAs are not applied to the downstream disease prognosis and therapeutic analysis from the perspective of data analysis. In this end, we present a systemic pipeline including disease-associated lncRNAs identification and downstream pathogenesis analysis on how the predicted lncRNAs are involved in the disease prognosis and therapy. Due to the importance of identifying disease-associated lncRNAs and the weak interpretability of existing computational identification methods, we propose a novel approach named iLncDA-PT to identify disease-associated lncRNAs considering the interactions between various bio-entities outperforming the other state-of-the-art methods, and then we conduct a systematically subsequent analysis on prognosis and therapy for a specific disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as an example. Finally, we reveal a significant association between immune checkpoint expression, tumor microenvironment, and drug treatment.",

        "abstract": "Urban planning faces complex challenges, including efficient resource allocation, traffic management, and infrastructure optimization. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing these multifaceted issues, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. This study introduces a novel approach by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Simulated Annealing (SA) to tackle these challenges in urban planning. GNNs are employed to extract meaningful features and relationships from urban infrastructure and social networks, providing a detailed understanding of patterns and interactions. SA is then used to optimize resource allocation, traffic routing, and scheduling tasks based on the insights derived from GNNs. This hybrid methodology allows for an iterative refinement process, where updated features from GNNs continuously enhance the optimization performed by SA. Key findings of the study reveal significant improvements. Traffic congestion was reduced by 25%, and average travel times decreased by 18%. Resource allocation efficiency improved by 30%, with a 20% reduction in resource wastage. Infrastructure optimization metrics showed a 22% gain in cost efficiency and a 15% increase in accessibility. The combined GNN-SA approach proved effective in addressing urban planning inefficiencies and optimizing various aspects of smart city management. The contributions of this study include a robust framework for integrating advanced AI techniques to solve complex urban planning problems, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for modern smart cities. The results highlight the potential of hybrid AI approaches in enhancing urban planning and provide a foundation for future research and application in this field.",

        "abstract": "Millions of users are active on social networking platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and others to access information related to the news, entertainment, or sharing life events with peers. These platforms are intermediate channels for spreading rumors, posting hate speech, bullying, etc. Hate speech is one that frequently appears on social media platforms nowadays. Hate speech sometimes impairs readers' mental and emotional health and societal order, even encouraging suicide. Therefore, timely detection is required to prevent the spread of hate speech posts on social media platforms. The researchers have reported some research works on textual hate speech detection. However, social media posts are not limited to text; images and text with images are also used in the posts, termed multimodal data. The text-based model is not sufficient to handle the multimodal data. Therefore, this study introduces a reliable architecture that utilizes deep learning and transfer learning capabilities to classify multimodal social media posts into hate and non-hate. The proposed model is compatible with text, images, and images with text-based social posts to categorize hate and non-hate social media posts. The feature-fusion-based MMFFHS proposed framework performed better than the existing models by achieving 70.26% accuracy",

        "abstract": "In real-world applications, multi-view datasets often comprise diverse data sources or views, inevitably accompanied by noise. However, most existing graph-based multi-view clustering methods utilize fixed graph similarity matrices to handle noisy multi-view data, necessitating additional clustering steps for obtaining the final clustering. This paper proposes a Robust Joint Graph learning for Multi-view Clustering (RJGMC) based on â1- norm to address these problems. RJGMC integrates the learning processes of the graph similarity matrix and the unified graph matrix to improve mutual reinforcement between these graph matrices. Simultaneously, employing the â1-norm to generate the unified graph matrix enhances the algorithm's robustness. A rank constraint is imposed on the graph Laplacian matrix of the unified graph matrix, where clustering can be divided directly without additional processing. In addition, we also introduce a method for automatically assigning optimal weights to each view. The optimization of this objective function employs an alternating optimization approach. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques regarding clustering performance and robustness.",

        "abstract": "Environmental air pollution has become a cause of global concern due to its adverse effects. Unusually high concentration of air pollutants can be regarded as an anomaly indicating certain air quality problems. This paper presents a deep learning based anomaly detection approach to identify anomalous concentrations of five different air pollutants: Carbon Monoxide ( $CO$ ), Ozone ( $O_{3}$ ), Nitogen Oxide ( $NO_{X}$ ) and Particulate Matters ( $PM_{2.5}$ , $PM_{10}$ ) in a real-life environmental dataset. The collected data is multivariate in nature containing hourly generated information about several air pollutants and atmospheric parameters from a non-polluted city of India. The proposed framework contains a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) based predictor model with self-attention to capture the normal pollutant levels in the time series dataset. The predictor model is responsible for predicting the value at the next timestamp, corresponding to a given window of the time series data. A subsequent anomaly detector is utilized to identify the anomalous pollutant levels based on the predictions of predictor model. Anomalies detected by the proposed framework are utilized to analyze the correlation of temporal and atmospheric parameters with the anomalous concentration levels. Experimental results illustrate the predominance of proposed approach over existing approaches towards air pollution assessment.",

        "abstract": "Identifying points of interest (POIs) on the surface of 3D shapes is a significant challenge in geometric processing research. The complex connection between POIs and their geometric descriptors, combined with the small percentage of POIs on the shape, makes detecting POIs on any given 3D shape a highly challenging task. Existing methods directly detect POIs from the entire 3D shape, resulting in low efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal POI detection method using a coarse-to-fine approach, with the key idea of reducing data complexity and enabling more efficient and accurate subsequent POI detection by first identifying and processing important regions on the 3D shape. It first obtains important areas on the 3D shape through 2D projected images, then processes points within these regions using attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing POI detection techniques.",

        "abstract": "Interactive semantic segmentation pursues high-quality segmentation results at the cost of a small number of user clicks. It is attracting more and more research attention for its convenience in labeling semantic pixel-level data. Existing interactive segmentation methods often pursue higher interaction efficiency by mining the latent information of user clicks or exploring efficient interaction manners. However, these works neglect to explicitly exploit the semantic correlations between user corrections and model mispredictions, thus suffering from two flaws. First, similar prediction errors frequently occur in actual use, causing users to repeatedly correct them. Second, the interaction difficulty of different semantic classes varies across images, but existing models use monotonic parameters for all images which lack semantic pertinence. Therefore, in this article, we explore the semantic correlations existing in corrections and mispredictions by proposing a simple yet effective online learning solution to the above problems, named correction-misprediction correlation mining ( $\textrm{CM}^\textrm{2}$ ). Specifically, we leverage the correction-misprediction similarities to design a confusion memory module (CMM) for automatic correction when similar prediction errors reappear. Furthermore, we measure the semantic interaction difficulty by counting the correction-misprediction pairs and design a challenge adaptive convolutional layer (CACL), which can adaptively switch different parameters according to interaction difficulties to better segment the challenging classes. Our method requires no extra training besides the online learning process and can effectively improve interaction efficiency. Our proposed $\textrm{CM}^\textrm{2}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on three public semantic segmentation benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to fuse textual, acoustic, and visual information to predict a speaker's sentiment states effectively. However, in real-world scenarios, the text modality received by MSA systems is often obtained through automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Unfortunately, ASR may erroneously recognize sentiment words as phonetically similar neutral alternatives, leading to sentiment degradation in text and impacting MSA accuracy. Recent attempts aim to first identify the sentiment word substitution (SWS) error in ASR results and then refine the corrupted word embeddings using multimodal information for final multimodal fusion. However, such a method includes a burdensome and ambiguous detection operation and ignores the inherent correlations and heterogeneity among different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a more compact system, termed ARF-MSA consisting of three key components to achieving robust MSA with SWS errors: 1) Alignment : we establish connections between the âtext-acoustic' and âtext-visualâ representations to effectively map the âtext-acoustic-visualâ data into a unified sentiment space by leveraging their multimodal correlation knowledge; 2) Refinement : we perform fine-grained comparisons between the text modality and the other two modalities in the unified sentiment space, enabling refinement of the sentiment expression within the text modality more concisely; 3) Fusion : Finally, we hierarchically fuse the dominant and non-dominant representation from three heterogeneity modalities to obtain the multimodal feature for MSA. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Codes are available at: https://github.com/ARFMSA/ARF-MSA .",

        "abstract": "Edge computing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficient scheduling at the network edge to fulfill users' requirements for low latency. Edge servers' and clouds' ability to interact allows them to leverage edge servers' limited computing and storage resources collectively to handle all requests collaboratively. This has unlocked the potential of the edge-cloud system. However, its sophistication (e.g., heterogeneous resources, intertwined dependencies, etc.) also raised unforeseen challenges in request dispatch and service orchestration phases within the scheduling process, including complex hierarchy , limited cooperation and unfocused information . Traditional resource optimization methods for edge-cloud systems cannot address these intricate situations properly, raising concerns over system efficiency, stability, and costs. This paper proposes learning-based methods to accommodate time-varying requests and dynamic service prevalence. Specifically, we employ the multi-agent advantage actor-critic (MAA2C) and the graph convolutional networks-based MAA2C (GCN-MAA2C) in two phases, respectively, to enhance individual intelligence and facilitate optimal dispatch and orchestration decisions. Inspired by the regulations in human society, we propose SocialEdge , a socialized learning-based scheduling framework for the edge-cloud system. To leverage the hierarchical correlation, we develop an inter-layer socialized refining mechanism. The inference results from one layer guide the training process of the next layer, enabling the abstraction of optimization-critical knowledge. Moreover, we apply intra-layer socialized cooperating, where federated averaging with MAA2C is implemented to ensure the cooperation of individuals over private data for achieving optimal global solutions. Furthermore, we propose a socialized resonance mechanism across the layers to extract high-value information and induce resonance toward the system objective, aiming to improve the effi...",

        "abstract": "Water quality monitoring with distributed water quality probes is crucial for environmental protection and public health. But missing data in time series poses a significant challenge in environmental management. This paper introduces a novel long interval gap-filling method using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder with multi-head Attention Mechanism (BiLSTM-AAM). The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to focus on informative regions within the data, even with extensive gaps while the autoencoder module aids in dimensionality reduction. The efficacy of BiLSTM-AAM was evaluated by a big real-world water quality dataset and further tested in other environmental contexts, demonstrating superior performance compared to three other similar models. The results highlight the modelâs ability to accurately reconstruct missing values, capture complex dependencies, and restore data integrity even with high percentages of missing data. Our findings indicate significant implications for pattern analysis and machine intelligence, ultimately contributing to better monitoring for water process engineering and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task to support biomedical research. In Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), obtaining high-quality expert annotated data is laborious and expensive, leading to the development of automatic approaches such as distant supervision. However, manually and automatically generated data often suffer from the unlabeled entity problem , whereby many entity annotations are missing, degrading the performance of full annotation NER models. To conquer this issue, we undertake a systematic exploration of the efficacy of partial annotation learning methods for BioNER, which encompasses a comprehensive evaluation conducted across a spectrum of distinct simulated scenarios of missing entity annotations. Furthermore, we propose a TS-PubMedBERT-Partial-CRF partial annotation learning model. We standardize a compilation of 16 BioNER corpora, encompassing a range of five distinct entity types, to establish a gold standard. And we compare against the state-of-the-art partial annotation model EER-PubMedBERT, the widely acknowledged partial annotation model BiLSTM-Partial-CRF model, and the state-of-the-art full annotation learning BioNER model PubMedBERT tagger. Results show that partial annotation learning-based methods can effectively learn from biomedical corpora with missing entity annotations. Our proposed model outperforms alternatives and, specifically, the PubMedBERT tagger by 38% in F1-score under high missing entity rates. Moreover, the recall of entity mentions in our model demonstrates a competitive alignment with the upper threshold observed on the fully annotated dataset.

        "abstract": "Effective connectivity estimation plays a crucial role in understanding the interactions and information flow between different brain regions. However, the functional time series used for estimating effective connectivity is derived from certain software, which may lead to large computing errors because of different parameter settings and degrade the ability to model complex causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, a brain diffuser with hierarchical transformer (BDHT) is proposed to estimate effective connectivity for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To our best knowledge, the proposed brain diffuser is the first generative model to apply diffusion models to the application of generating and analyzing multimodal brain networks. Specifically, the BDHT leverages structural connectivity to guide the reverse processes in an efficient way. It makes the denoising process more reliable and guarantees effective connectivity estimation accuracy. To improve denoising quality, the hierarchical denoising transformer is designed to learn multi-scale features in topological space. By stacking the multi-head attention and graph convolutional network, the graph convolutional transformer (GraphConformer) module is devised to enhance structure-function complementarity and improve the ability in noise estimation. Experimental evaluations of the denoising diffusion model demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating effective connectivity. The proposed model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches. Moreover, the proposed model can identify altered directional connections and provide a comprehensive understanding of parthenogenesis for MCI treatment. Note to Practitioners âDiagnosing MCI allows for timely intervention and treatment measures to potentially slow down or even halt further cognitive decline. Exploring causal relations between brain regions enables a better understanding of pathogenic mechani...",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the three-dimensional (3D) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory-planning problem in a UAV-enabled data collection (DC) system, in which a UAV executes a mission to collect time-constrained data in a geographical area with spatial obstacles. For such a UAV trajectory-planning problem, how to timely collect data, avoid collisions with spatial obstacles, and complete DC with limited UAV onboard energy is a big challenge. To address this challenge, the investigated problem is formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the UAV's total mission completion time subject to the time constraint of collected data, the avoidance of spatial obstacles, and the energy constraint of the UAV. To solve the formulated problem, the problem is decomposed into a visiting sequence optimization sub-problem, and a hovering position and flying path optimization subproblem. Correspondingly, a genetic algorithm (GA) based algorithm, and a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm are proposed to solve the sub-problems, respectively. Based on the two algorithms, a 3D trajectory optimization algorithm is further proposed to solve the main problem. Simulation results show that the UAV's trajectory planned with the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the UAV's total mission completion time.",

        "abstract": "Computational limitations and Big Data analysis pose challenges in seeking efficient techniques to predict trajectories in three-body dynamics. Thus, a reduced-complexity classical algorithm is proposed utilizing predefined spacecraft's position and velocity data to achieve precise and accurate orbital trajectories of the spacecraft within three-body dynamics. The proposed algorithm seamlessly solves polynomial interpolation along with the boundary and interior conditions without the need for the spacecraft's acceleration data. Once the algorithm is derived, it will be tested across a diverse variety of periodic trajectories in the Earth-Moon system. Moreover, a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the time complexity of the proposed algorithm compared with conventional orbit propagators. Finally, the proposed algorithm will be utilized and extended to learn and update distant retrograde orbits (DRO) while training a neural network with several initial conditions composing minimum predefined data. After the training is done, the neural network is used to accurately predict DRO trajectories for a given initial condition, demonstrating the exceptional accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed learning process.",

        "abstract": "Driven by the vision of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) toward 6G technology, the WiFi-based respiration sensing approach has emerged as a highly competitive candidate for advanced healthcare services. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate perception of all the moving objects within the sensing area raises challenges for system stability and robustness for real-world deployment, especially for the susceptibility to motion interference from other people. Meanwhile, thanks to the emerging in-area wireless sensing technologies, i.e., beamforming, the dynamic environment tolerance of these technologies gives crucial opportunities for target-oriented WiFi-based healthcare services. This article discusses the compelling intersection of in-area WiFi sensing and the future of target-oriented intelligent respiratory healthcare network services. We first present a novel WiFi-based healthcare-assisting framework tailored for inter-user motion interference-tolerable (IMIT) sensing. The detailed components of low-level signal preprocessing, target-direction signal extraction, and healthcare-related services are discussed. By utilizing CSI beamforming technology, which adjusts a directional beam toward the desired direction and adaptively places beam nulls in noisy directions, we can mitigate motion interference and achieve target-oriented healthcare sensing. Finally, we discuss open challenges and potential solutions for target-oriented WiFi healthcare sensing.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation person re-identification (UDA person re-ID) aims at transferring the knowledge on the source domain with expensive manual annotation to the unlabeled target domain. Most of the recent papers leverage pseudo-labels for the target images to accomplish this task. However, the noise in the generated labels hinders the identification system from learning discriminative features. To address this problem, this paper proposes a deep mutual distillation (DMD) to generate reliable pseudo-labels for UDA person re-ID. The proposed DMD applies two parallel branches for feature extraction, and each branch serves as the teacher of the other to generate pseudo-labels for its training. This mutually reinforcing optimization framework enhances the reliability of pseudo-labels, improving the identification performance. In addition, this paper develops a bilateral graph representation (BGR) to describe the pedestrian images. BGR mimics the person re-identification of the human to aggregate the identity features according to the visual similarity and attribute consistency. Experimental results on Market-1501 and Duke demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Text-to-image generation models have significantly broadened the horizons of creative expression through the power of natural language. However, navigating these models to generate unique concepts, alter their appearance, or reimagine them in unfamiliar roles presents an intricate challenge. For instance, how can we exploit language-guided models to transpose an anime character into a different art style, or envision a beloved character in a radically different setting or role? This paper unveils a novel approach named DreamAnime, designed to provide this level of creative freedom. Using a minimal set of 2-3 images of a user-specified concept such as an anime character or an art style, we teach our model to encapsulate its essence through novel âwordsâ in the embedding space of a pre-existing text-to-image model. Crucially, we disentangle the concepts of style and identity into two separate âwordsâ, thus providing the ability to manipulate them independently. These distinct âwordsâ can then be pieced together into natural language sentences, promoting an intuitive and personalized creative process. Empirical results suggest that this disentanglement into separate word embeddings successfully captures a broad range of unique and complex concepts, with each word focusing on style or identity as appropriate. Comparisons with existing methods illustrate DreamAnime's superior capacity to accurately interpret and recreate the desired concepts across various applications and tasks.

        "abstract": "With the development of the new generation of information technologies such as the Internet-of-Things, Big Data, and High-Performance Computing, mobile edge devices are widely used in almost every aspect of our lives to provide personalized services. One key challenge how to efficiently process the multi-attribute data is essential to analyze the usersâ information including the usersâ consumption habits and the foundation to provide high-quality services as well. Although the existing models such as the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are used to process and analyze multi-attribute data, there are still many challenges about multi-attribute data processing. In this paper, a tensor-aided high-order pooling operator based on RNN (RNNPool), namely the TT-RNNPool3D model, using tensor as the multi-attribute data representation tool is proposed. The TT-RNNPool3D model uses tensor-train (TT) decomposition to improve the accuracy by decomposing multi-attribute data into multiple tensor-cores for parallel processing. This improves TT-RNNPool3Dâs efficiency by reducing the number of parameters, which is suitable for mobile edge devices in processing multi-attribute data. To demonstrate the performances of the TT-RNNPool3D model such as the accuracy and efficiency, experiments are carried out on three different datasets.",

However, numerous existing methods improve CSI compression and reconstruction accuracy at the cost of computational complexity by designing more complex deep learning modules. In this letter, we propose a novel lightweight neural network IALNet for CSI feedback problem. In the proposed IALNet, we design an integration attention module (IAM) for improving the performance of the network. Specifically, By embedding the correlation information of the vertical and horizontal directions of CSI matrix into the channel attention, the IAM enabled IALNet to capture distribution characteristics of CSI matrix while focusing on the important regions of interest in the vertical and horizontal directions and enhancing the feature representation. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our IALNet outperforms previous SOTA networks in both outdoor and indoor scenarios, providing an efficient, low cost and flexible CSI feedback solution.",

        "abstract": "To reduce the required pilot and feedback overhead in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided wireless communication systems under frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, a deep distributed learning-based joint channel estimation and feedback framework is proposed. Specifically, in the channel estimation stage, an RIS channel estimation network (RIS-CENet) is designed to reconstruct the channel from limited pilots by using the dual-channel attention mechanism. In the channel feedback stage, the RIS channel feedback network (RIS-CFNet), based on a multi-head attention mechanism, is designed to capture the global features of high-dimensional channel matrices, thereby enabling their effective compression. Furthermore, an efficient distributed learning framework is proposed to achieve channel estimation and feedback tasks in complex and rapidly changing wireless channel environments. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed distributed learning architecture is comparable to that of the centralized learning architecture. Distributed scheme I has better feedback accuracy, while distributed scheme II can effectively reduce the complexity of the system.",

We develop a general channel model to accurately describe the channel characteristics in the near-field region and formulate an MA-position optimization problem to minimize the BSâs transmit power subject to usersâ individual rate constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a two-loop dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm optimization (DNPPSO) algorithm that significantly reduces the computational complexity as compared to the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm while achieving similar performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme in power-saving for near-field multiuser communications.",

        "abstract": "The Data Transmission Resource Scheduling Problem (DTRSP) is pivotal for effectively utilizing remotely-sensed Big Data. However, existing literature tends to address this challenge by separately considering ground-based or space-based antenna resources. This article introduces a paradigm, known as the Space-Ground Integrated DTRSP (SGI-DTRSP), wherein both ground-based and space-based antennas are collaboratively scheduled for efficient data transmission back to the ground. For the first time, a mathematical integer programming model for addressing SGI-DTRSP is proposed. To tackle this problem efficiently, we present a Distributed Discrete Jaya (DD-Jaya) algorithm. In DD-Jaya, the entire population is divided into three subpopulations, each evolving independently through different global search strategiesâ best-Jaya or random-Jaya. Additionally, an adaptive local search strategy is incorporated into DD-Jaya to enhance exploitation capacity. The quality of individuals is further improved by sharing superior evolutionary information among subpopulations. Finally, extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that DD-Jaya outperforms the existing algorithms, especially when dealing with large-scale SGI-DTRSP.",

        "abstract": "Predicting G proteinâcoupled receptor (GPCR)âligand binding affinity plays a crucial role in drug development. However, determining GPCRâligand binding affinities is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Although many studies used data-driven methods to predict binding affinity, most of these methods required protein 3D structure, which was often unknown. Moreover, part of these studies only considered the sequence characteristics of the protein, ignoring the secondary structure of the protein. The number of known GPCR for affinity prediction is only a few thousand, which is insufficient for deep learning training. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a deep transfer learning method called TrGPCR, which used dynamic transfer learning to solve the problem of insufficient GPCR data. We used the Binding Database(BindingDB) as the source domain and the GLASS(GPCR-Ligand Association) database as the target domain. We also introduced protein secondary structures, called pockets, as features to predict binding affinities. Compared with DeepDTA, our model improved by 5.2% on RMSE(root mean square error) and 4.5% on MAE(mean squared error).",

        "abstract": "Although it is widely deemed impossible to overcome the information theoretic optimality of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher in pre-and post-quantum cryptography, this work shows that the optimality of information theoretic security (ITS) of OTP is paradoxical from the perspective of information conservational computing and cryptography. To prove this point, ITS of OTP is extended to information conservational security (ICS) of scalable OTP (S-OTP) with percentage-based key extension where total key length can be reduced to a condensed tiny minimum through âblack holeâ keypad compression coupled with âbig bangâ data recov-ery. The cost is a limited 25%+ increase in total data length and network traffic; the gain is to makes the transmission of long messages possible without weakening ITS/OTP. It is proven that if ITS/OTP were optimal, ICS/S-OTP would be impossible; on the other hand, if ICS/S-OTP were not information theoretically secure, ITS/OTP would not be secure either. Thus, we have a proof by contradiction on the paradoxical nature of OTP optimality. It is further proven that a summation with percentage distribution is a special case of equilibrium-based bipolar quantum cellular automata. This proof bridges a classical world with a quantum world and makes it possible to combine the advantages of both approaches for pre-and post-quantum cryptography. It is suggested that the findings of this work form an analytical paradigm of quantum intelligence machinery toward perfect information conservational security. Some mysteries in nature and science are identified. In particular, the question is posted: Could modern science have been like a well-founded building with a floor of observable beings and truths but missing its roof for equilibrium, harmony, information conservation, and logically definable causality?.",

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal neural networks have been successfully applied to weather forecasting tasks recently. The key notion is to learn spatio-temporal features concurrently from spatial and temporal dependencies. Existing methods are mainly based on local smoothness assumptions where the features are learned by accumulating information in local spatio-temporal regions. However, the weather conditions in a certain spatio-temporal region are usually influenced by global meteorological changes and long-range historical weather conditions. Therefore, these methods that ignore the large-scale spatio-temporal effects can hardly learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal Transformer network in weather forecasting to address the above challenges. The main idea is to leverage the Transformer architecture to carefully capture the multi-scale spatial and long-range temporal information in weather data. First, we propose to combine the global and local position encodings based on absolute geographic locations and relative geodesic distances and insert them into the spatial Transformer to extract the multi-scale spatial information in meteorological graphs. Then, we further capture the long-range temporal dependencies by a temporal Transformer where the attention mechanism is used to improve the representation ability and scalability of the models. Extensive experiments over real weather datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",

        "abstract": "Deep hashing technology has recently become an essential tool for cross-modal retrieval on large-scale datasets. However, their performances heavily depend on accurate annotations to train the hashing model. In real applications, we usually only obtain low-quality label annotations owing to labor and time consumption limitations. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by noisy labels, in this paper, we propose a robust deep hashing method, called deep hashing with ranking learning (DHRL), for cross-modal retrieval. The proposed DHRL method consists of a refined semantic concept alignment module and a ranking-swapping module. In this first module, we adopt two transformers to perform the semantic alignment tasks between different modalities on a set of refined concepts, and then convert them into hash codes to reduce heterogeneous differences between multimodalities. The second module first identifies the noisy labels in the training set and ranks them according to ranking loss. Then it swaps the ranking information of different modal network branches. Unlike existing robust hashing methods for assuming noise distribution, our proposed DHRL method requires no prior assumptions for the input data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets have shown that our proposed DHRL method has stronger advantages over other state-of-the-art hashing methods.

        "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing is a distributed computing paradigm that utilizes the collective intelligence of workers to perform complex tasks. How to achieve privacy-preserving task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing applications has been a popular research area. However, most of the existing task assignment schemes may reveal private and sensitive information of tasks or workers. Few schemes can support task assignment based on different attributes simultaneously, such as spatial, interest, etc. To study the above themes, in this paper, we propose one privacy-preserving task assignment scheme with multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications (TAMT). Specifically, we first define Euclidean distance-based location search and Hamming distance-based interest search, which map the demands of the tasks and the interests of the workers into the binary vectors. Second, we deploy PKD-tree to index the task data leveraging the pivoting techniques and the triangular inequality of Euclidean distance, and propose an efficient multi-threshold range search algorithm based on matrix encryption and decomposition technology. Furthermore, based on DT-PKC, we introduce a ciphertext-based secure comparison protocol to support multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications. Finally, comprehensive security analysis proves that our proposed TAMT is privacy-preserving. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that TAMT is practical and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of organelle instances from electron microscopy (EM) images plays an essential role in many neuroscience researches. However, practical scenarios usually suffer from high annotation costs, label scarcity, and large domain diversity. While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) that assumes no annotation effort on the target data is promising to alleviate these challenges, its performance on complicated segmentation tasks is still far from practical usage. To address these issues, we investigate a highly annotation-efficient weak supervision, which assumes only sparse center-points on a small subset of object instances in the target training images. To achieve accurate segmentation with partial point annotations, we introduce instance counting and center detection as auxiliary tasks and design a multitask learning framework to leverage correlations among the counting, detection, and segmentation, which are all tasks with partial or no supervision. Building upon the different domain-invariances of the three tasks, we enforce counting estimation with a novel soft consistency loss as a global prior for center detection, which further guides the per-pixel segmentation. To further compensate for annotation sparsity, we develop a cross-position cut-and-paste for label augmentation and an entropy-based pseudo-label selection. The experimental results highlight that, by simply using extremely weak annotation, e.g., 15% sparse points, for model training, the proposed model is capable of significantly outperforming UDA methods and produces comparable performance as the supervised counterpart. The high robustness of our model shown in the validations and the low requirement of expert knowledge for sparse point annotation further improve the potential application value of our model.",

        "abstract": "Although face recognition starts to play an important role in our daily life, we need to pay attention that data-driven face recognition vision systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, current digital adversarial attacks and physical adversarial attacks both have drawbacks, with the former ones impractical and the latter one conspicuous, high-computational and low-executable. To address the issues, we propose a practical, executable, stealthy and low computational adversarial attack based on LED illumination modulation. To fool the systems, the proposed attack generates physically imperceptible luminance changes to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of scene LED illumination and uses the rolling shutter effect of CMOS image sensors in face recognition systems to implant luminance information perturbation to the captured face images. In summary, we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for face detection and an evasion attack for face verification. We also evaluate their effectiveness against wellknown face detection models, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace, and face verification models, Dlib, FaceNet, and ArcFace. The extensive physical experiments show that the success rates of DoS attacks against face detection models reach 97.67%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the success rates of evasion attacks against all face verification models reach 100%.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as an efficient decentralized distributed learning approach, enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data. Despite its advantages, the performance of FL models is substantially impacted by the domain feature shift arising from different acquisition devices/clients. Moreover, existing FL methods often prioritize accuracy without considering reliability factors such as confidence or uncertainty, leading to unreliable predictions in safety-critical applications. Thus, our goal is to enhance FL performance by addressing non-domain feature issues and ensuring model reliability. In this study, we introduce a novel approach named RFedDis (Reliable Federated Disentangling Network). RFedDis leverages feature disentangling to capture a global domain-invariant cross-client representation while preserving local client-specific feature learning. Additionally, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware decision fusion mechanism to effectively integrate the decoupled features. This ensures dynamic integration at the evidence level, producing reliable predictions accompanied by estimated uncertainties. Therefore, RFedDis is the FL approach to combine evidential uncertainty with feature disentangling, enhancing both performance and reliability in handling non-IID domain features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RFedDis outperforms other state-of-the-art FL approaches, providing outstanding performance coupled with a high degree of reliability. The code for RFedDis will be made available at: https://github.com/LooKing9218/RFedDis .",

        "abstract": "The growing demand for location-based services in areas like virtual reality, robot control, and navigation has intensified the focus on indoor localization. Visible light positioning (VLP), leveraging visible light communications (VLC), becomes a promising indoor positioning technology due to its high accuracy and low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of VLP systems. In particular, since VLC lays the foundation for VLP, we first present a detailed overview of the principles of VLC. Then, we provide an in-depth overview of VLP algorithms. The performance of each positioning algorithm is also compared in terms of various metrics such as accuracy, coverage, and orientation limitation. Beyond the physical layer studies, the network design for a VLP system is also investigated, including multi-access technologies, resource allocation, and light-emitting diode (LED) placements. Next, the applications of the VLP systems are overviewed. Finally, this paper outlines open issues, challenges, and opportunities for the research field. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic survey on VLP from state-of-the-art studies to practical uses.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that there is a remarkable achievement on multifocus image fusion, most of the existing methods only generate a low-resolution image if the given source images suffer from low resolution. Obviously, a naive strategy is to independently conduct image fusion and image super-resolution. However, this two-step approach would inevitably introduce and enlarge artifacts in the final result if the result from the first step meets artifacts. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a novel method to simultaneously achieve image fusion and super-resolution in one framework, avoiding step-by-step processing of fusion and super-resolution. Since a small receptive field can discriminate the focusing characteristics of pixels in detailed regions, while a large receptive field is more robust to pixels in smooth regions, a subnetwork is first proposed to compute the affinity of features under different types of receptive fields, efficiently increasing the discriminability of focused pixels. Simultaneously, in order to prevent from distortion, a gradient embedding-based super-resolution subnetwork is also proposed, in which the features from the shallow layer, the deep layer, and the gradient map are jointly taken into account, allowing us to get an upsampled image with high resolution. Compared with the existing methods, which implemented fusion and super-resolution independently, our proposed method directly achieves these two tasks in a parallel way, avoiding artifacts caused by the inferior output of image fusion or super-resolution. Experiments conducted on the real-world dataset substantiate the superiority of our proposed method compared with state of the arts.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hierarchical methodology to planning safe UAV trajectories in complex environments. We start by improving a canonical hybrid A* in relation to high memory requirements, performance degradation, and the low efficiency customarily observed in the initial global trajectory suggested by the planner. Then, the Marden theorem is applied -for the first time in local path planning -to generate continuous, non-intersecting, enclosed, and safe flight corridors, termed homotopic enclosed safe motion corridors (HESMCs) hereafter. This is efficiently realized through a series of unique ellipsoids along the initial route. Meanwhile, the optimized motion trajectory along the corridors is built by considering two waypoints and prescribed performance functions. The resolved path is safe and complete, with a comprehensive Lyapunov stability analysis included to ensure accurate and efficient trajectory tracking. The simulation and physical tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed planner over existing state-of-the-art methods, with consistent and significant improvements in processing time and guaranteed completeness. Note to Practitioners âThe authors perceived the contribution of the manuscript of particular relevance to users of UAVs seeking advanced safety in their guidance and navigational solutions, offering a blend of theoretical innovation and practical applicability. The work introduces a distinct hierarchical motion planner specifically designed to enhance safety and reliability in UAV navigation. Key to this is the development of an improved hybrid A* algorithm for global planning, which effectively tackles practical issues such as high memory consumption and performance degradation. A significant theoretical contribution is the application of the Marden theorem in local optimization. This facilitates the generation of homotopic enclosed motion corridors using unique safe boundary ellipsoids, thus reducing navigation complexity and the ...",

        "abstract": "The dissemination of public opinion in the social media network is driven by public sentiment, which can be used to promote the effective resolution of social incidents. However, public sentiments for incidents are often affected by environmental factors such as geography, politics, and ideology, which increases the complexity of the sentiment acquisition task. Therefore, a hierarchical mechanism is designed to reduce complexity and utilize processing at multiple phases to improve practicality. Through serial processing between different phases, the task of public sentiment acquisition can be decomposed into two subtasks, which are the classification of report text to locate incidents and sentiment analysis of individualsâ reviews. Performance has been improved through improvements to the model structure, such as embedding tables and gating mechanisms. That being said, the traditional centralized structure model is not only easy to form model silos in the process of performing tasks but also faces security risks. In this article, a novel distributed deep learning model called isomerism learning based on blockchain is proposed to address these challenges, the trusted collaboration between models can be realized through parallel training. In addition, for the problem of text heterogeneity, we also designed a method to measure the objectivity of events to dynamically assign the weights of models to improve aggregation efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve performance and outperform the state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant milestone in technological advancement, impacting various sectors and transforming the essence of public and personal activities. Traditional machine learning, known as centralized learning, involves collecting data from multiple sources for model development, which poses significant privacy risks. To address the conflict between the need for data sharing and the protection of privacy, federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. This approach allows for the continuous sharing of model updates between a central server and numerous local devices, fostering collaborative model development. However, it also brings about considerable communication costs and raises privacy concerns due to the potential for sensitive information leakage from the central server and local devices. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and accuracy-lossless privacy-preserving federated learning scheme based on gradient clipping. The central server introduces noise to the global model to prevent clients from extracting valuable information, and then the local devices train these models using their data. To reduce the communication load, parameters with less impact on the model are removed using the Fisher information matrix. Additionally, to enhance privacy protection, the client-computed parameters are perturbed using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. Our experiments show that this approach greatly reduces the communication load for clients and the server, while effectively safeguarding client privacy and maintaining the modelâs accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Multiview attributed graph clustering is an important approach to partition multiview data based on the attribute characteristics and adjacent matrices from different views. Some attempts have been made in using graph neural network (GNN), which have achieved promising clustering performance. Despite this, few of them pay attention to the inherent specific information embedded in multiple views. Meanwhile, they are incapable of recovering the latent high-level representation from the low-level ones, greatly limiting the downstream clustering performance. To fill these gaps, a novel dual information enhanced multiview attributed graph clustering (DIAGC) method is proposed in this article. Specifically, the proposed method introduces the specific information reconstruction (SIR) module to disentangle the explorations of the consensus and specific information from multiple views, which enables graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture the more essential low-level representations. Besides, the contrastive learning (CL) module maximizes the agreement between the latent high-level representation and low-level ones and enables the high-level representation to satisfy the desired clustering structure with the help of the self-supervised clustering (SC) module. Extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DIAGC method compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "In few-shot fine-grained recognition (FS-FGR) tasks, the main challenge is to distinguish novel categories with high intra-class variations and low inter-class differences given scarce training data. Existing studies explore discriminative features through a compact network to avoid overfitting, while they achieve marginal performance gain owing to the limited representation capability. Motivated by the significant progress of the vision foundation model, we introduce it to describe visual attributes and boost the performance of the compact feature extractor. A few-shot fine-grained recognition method with Variational Feature Imitation Conditioned on Visual Descriptions, VFI-CVD for short, has been proposed in this paper. It simultaneously exploits the pre-trained knowledge from a vision foundation model and the expert knowledge mined by a feature extractor. Specifically, the intra-class variations shared across object categories are encoded into a common distribution thus we can augment features by sampling latent variables. To enhance the learning of intra-class variations, a condition exchange strategy (CES) is put forward to interact the knowledge between samples through feature cross-imitation. In the inference stage, the learned knowledge is further integrated through the joint prediction of visual descriptions and cross-imitated features. Comprehensive experimental results on four fine-grained benchmark datasets show that the proposed VFI-CVD achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 90.37% under the 5-way 1-shot setting on CUB-200-2011. It surpasses existing methods by a large margin, especially in the challenging 30-way recognition tasks and cross-domain evaluation.

        "abstract": "Traffic condition prediction is crucial for executing traffic control and scheduling tasks within intelligent transportation systems. With diversified data sources, effectively modeling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in the whole traffic network and predicting nonlinear general traffic condition changes become primary challenges for intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, a double-layer spatial-temporal feature extraction and evaluation (DL-STFEE) model is proposed, aimed at accurately predicting the traffic condition transferring of the whole traffic network. Firstly, a public traffic dataset is processed to extract the spatial and temporal features of vehicles, as well as the clusters of traffic conditions of the entire traffic network. Secondly, a double-layer deep learning traffic condition predictor is proposed. The model incorporates a spatial-temporal feature extraction layer, which leverages the graph convolution network (GCN) and attention mechanism to obtain spatiotemporal features across the whole traffic network. Additionally, a spatial-temporal combination layer employs a high-dimensional self-attention mechanism to integrate features across spatial-temporal combinations, bolstering prediction accuracy. Finally, through rigorous experiments, the contributions of neural network structures on the spatial-temporal feature extraction are comprehensively analyzed and the experiments also validate the effectiveness of traffic condition prediction by the proposed DL-STFEE model.",

        "abstract": "In the field of fake news detection, deep learning techniques have emerged as superior performers in recent years. Nevertheless, the majority of these studies primarily concentrate on either unimodal feature-based methodologies or image-text multimodal fusion techniques, with a minimal focus on the fusion of unstructured text features and structured tabular features. In this study, we present SGAMF, a Sparse Gated Attentionbased Multimodal Fusion strategy, designed to amalgamate text features and auxiliary features for the purpose of fake news identification. Compared with traditional multimodal fusion methods, SGAMF can effectively balance accuracy and inference time while selecting the most important features. A novel sparsegated-attention mechanism has been proposed which instigates a shift in text representation conditioned on auxiliary features, thereby selectively filtering out non-essential features. We have further put forward an enhanced ALBERT for the encoding of text features, capable of balancing efficiency and accuracy. To corroborate our methodology, we have developed a multimodal COVID-19 fake news detection dataset. Comprehensive experimental outcomes on this dataset substantiate that our proposed SGAMF delivers competitive performance in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and F 1 score",

        "abstract": "This study investigates a novel commonsense inference task that comprises reasoning about the subsequent events chains and probable consumption intents, given an event described in brief free-form text. For instance, given the event â fall in love â, the system anticipates ensuing events such as â get married âââ be pregnant âââ have a baby â. Concurrently, the system predicts the likely consumption intents of the event participants, such as purchasing â jewelry â, â maternity clothing â, and â baby food â. The event chains generated in this process provide explicit, meaningful explanations, aiding the understanding of inferred consumption intents. To facilitate this study, we construct a new crowdsourced corpus: x-ECON. This corpus comprises 10,144 event chains and 150 event-related product categories, offering a wide range of everyday consumer events and situations. We introduce a baseline reasoning framework that not only infers consumption intent but also generates an event chain to explain its inference. Our experimental results suggest that involving the event chain reasoning in the event-consumption reasoning system can help improve the neural networks' reason about the probable consumption intents of the event participants. Additionally, our method demonstrates the applicability of our approach in improving the performance of recommendation systems, by highlighting the role of explainable commonsense inference on the consumption intent. We also evaluated the performance of ChatGPT on our x-ECON dataset, showing that explainable event-consumption commonsense reasoning is a challenging task for large language models.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is being prominently used in smart cities and a wide range of applications in society. The benefits of IoT are evident, but cyber terrorism and security concerns inhibit many organizations and users from deploying it. Cyber-physical systems that are IoT-enabled might be difficult to secure since security solutions designed for general information/operational technology systems may not work as well in an environment. Thus, deep learning (DL) can assist as a powerful tool for building IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with automatic anomaly detection. In this paper, two distinct DL models have been employed i.e., Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), considered hybrid classifiers, to create a framework for detecting attacks in IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems. However, DL models need to be trained in such a way that will increase their classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper also aims to present a new hybrid optimization algorithm called âSeagull Adapted Elephant Herding Optimizationâ (SAEHO) to tune the weights of the hybrid classifier. The âHybrid Classifier + SAEHOâ framework takes the feature extracted dataset as an input and classifies the network as either attack or benign. Using sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and specificity, two datasets were compared. In every performance metric, the proposed framework outperforms conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, as human activities are shifting to social media, fake news detection has been a crucial problem. Existing methods ignore the classification difference in online news and cannot take full advantage of multi-classification knowledges. For example, when coping with a post âA mouse is frightened by a cat,â a model that learns âcomputerâ knowledge tends to misunderstand âmouseâ and give a fake label, but a model that learns âanimalâ knowledge tends to give a true label. Therefore, this research proposes a multi-classification division-aggregation framework to detect fake news, named CKA , which innovatively learns classification knowledges during training stages and aggregates them during prediction stages. It consists of three main components: a news characterizer, an ensemble coordinator, and a truth predictor. The news characterizer is responsible for extracting news features and obtaining news classifications. Cooperating with the news characterizer, the ensemble coordinator generates classification-specifical models for the maximum reservation of classification knowledges during the training stage, where each classification-specifical model maximizes the detection performance of fake news on corresponding news classifications. Further, to aggregate the classification knowledges during the prediction stage, the truth predictor uses the truth discovery technology to aggregate the predictions from different classification-specifical models based on reliability evaluation of classification-specifical models. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed CKA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fake news detection.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) aims to utilize freehand sketches for retrieving natural images with similar semantics in realistic zero-shot scenarios. Existing works focus on zero-shot semantic transfer using category word embedding and leveraging teacher-student networks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained models. They aim to retain rich discriminative features to achieve zero-shot semantic transfer. However, the category word embedding method is insufficient in flexibility, thereby limiting their retrieval performances in ZS-SBIR scenarios. In addition, the teacher network used for generating guidance signals results in computational redundancy, requiring repeated processing of mini-batch inputs. To address these issues, we propose a deep residual coupled prompt learning (DRCPL) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, we leverage the text encoder of CLIP to generate category classification weights, thereby improving the flexibility and generality of zero-shot semantic transfer. To tune text and vision representations effectively, we introduce learnable prompts at the input and freeze the parameters of the CLIP encoder. This approach not only effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting, but also significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model. We also introduce the text-vision prompt coupling function to enhance the coordinated consistency between the text and vision representations, ensuring that the two branches can train collaboratively. Finally, we gradually establish stage feature relationships by learning prompts independently at different early stages to facilitate rich contextual learning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our DRCPL method achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-SBIR tasks.

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) exhibit a robust capability for representation learning on graphs with complex structures, demonstrating superior performance across various applications. Most existing GNNs utilize graph convolution operations that integrate both attribute and structural information through coupled way. And these GNNs, from an optimization perspective, seek to learn a consensus and compromised embedding representation that balances attribute and graph information, selectively exploring and retaining valid information in essence. To obtain a more comprehensive embedding representation, a novel GNN framework, dubbed Decoupled Graph Neural Networks (DGNN), is introduced. DGNN separately explores distinctive embedding representations from the attribute and graph spaces by decoupled terms. Considering that the semantic graph, derived from attribute feature space, contains different node connection information and provides enhancement for the topological graph, both topological and semantic graphs are integrated by DGNN for powerful embedding representation learning. Further, structural consistency between the attribute embedding and the graph embedding is promoted to effectively eliminate redundant information and establish soft connection. This process involves facilitating factor sharing for adjacency matrices reconstruction, which aims at exploring consensus and high-level correlations. Finally, a more powerful and comprehensive representation is achieved through the concatenation of these embeddings. Experimental results conducted on several graph benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority in node classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the scientific impact of research scholars is increasingly crucial for career planning, particularly for young scholars considering career transitions. However, predicting a scholar's future development, especially after they move to a different academic group, presents significant challenges. To tackle this issue, we propose a Future Publication Impact Prediction Network (FPIPN) based on graph neural networks. FPIPN leverages rich information from a heterogeneous academic graph for impact prediction. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn the significance of graph information and utilize a knowledge distillation strategy to assess future impact based on historical records. Extensive experiments on a real-world academic dataset showcase the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods",

        "abstract": "As a classic k -NN graph construction method, NN-Descent has been adopted in various applications for its simplicity, genericness, and efficiency. However, its memory consumption is high due to the employment of two extra supporting graph structures. In this paper, a novel k -NN graph construction method is proposed. Similar to NN-Descent, the k -NN graph is constructed by doing cross-matching continuously on the sampled neighbors on each neighborhood. Whereas different from NN-Descent, the cross-matching is undertaken directly on the k -NN graph under construction. It makes the extra graph structures adopted to support the cross-matching no longer necessary. Moreover, no synchronization between different threads is needed within one iteration. The high-quality graph is constructed at the high-speed efficiency and considerably better memory efficiency over NN-Descent on both the multi-thread CPU and the GPU.",

        "abstract": "Gradient-based optimization methods implemented on distributed computing architectures are increasingly used to tackle large-scale machine learning applications. A key bottleneck in such distributed systems is the high communication overhead for exchanging information, such as stochastic gradients, between workers. The inherent causes of this bottleneck are the frequent communication rounds and the full model gradient transmission in every round. In this study, we present SASG, a communication-efficient distributed algorithm that enjoys the advantages of sparse communication and adaptive aggregated stochastic gradients. By dynamically determining the workers who need to communicate through an adaptive aggregation rule and sparsifying the transmitted information, the SASG algorithm reduces both the overhead of communication rounds and the number of communication bits in the distributed system. For the theoretical analysis, we introduce an important auxiliary variable and define a new Lyapunov function to prove that the communication-efficient algorithm is convergent. The convergence result is identical to the sublinear rate of stochastic gradient descent, and our result also reveals that SASG scales well with the number of distributed workers. Finally, experiments on training deep neural networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce communication overhead compared to previous methods.",

        "abstract": "Existing research on potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) relies on optimal policy in Markov decision process (MDP) where optimal policy is regarded as the ground truth. However, in some practical application scenarios, there is an extrapolation error challenge between the computed optimal policy and the real-world optimal policy. At this time, the optimal policy is unreliable. To address this challenge, we design a Reward Shaping based on Optimal-Policy-Free to get rid of the dependence on the optimal policy. We view reinforcement learning as probabilistic inference on a directed graph. Essentially, this inference propagates information from the rewarding states in the MDP and results in a function which is leveraged as a potential function for PBRS. Our approach utilizes a contrastive learning technique on directed graph Laplacian. Here, this technique does not change the structure of the directed graph. Then, the directed graph Laplacian is used to approximate the true state transition matrix in MDP. The potential function in PBRS can be learned through the message passing mechanism which is built on this directed graph Laplacian. The experiments on Atari, MuJoCo and MiniWorld show that our approach outperforms the competitive algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning, but they face challenges when applied to large-scale graphs due to substantial computational costs and memory requirements. To address scalability limitations, various methods have been proposed, including samplingbased and decoupling-based methods. However, these methods have their limitations: sampling-based methods inevitably discard some link information during the sampling process, while decoupling-based methods require alterations to the model's structure, reducing their adaptability to various GNNs. This paper proposes a novel graph pooling method, Graph Partial Pooling (GPPool), for scaling GNNs to large-scale graphs. GPPool is a versatile and straightforward technique that enhances training efficiency while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. GPPool constructs small-scale pooled graphs by pooling partial nodes into supernodes. Each pooled graph consists of supernodes and unpooled nodes, preserving valuable local and global information. Training GNNs on these graphs reduces memory demands and enhances their performance. Additionally, this paper provides a theoretical analysis of training GNNs using GPPool-constructed graphs from a graph diffusion perspective. It shows that a GNN can be transformed from a large-scale graph into pooled graphs with minimal approximation error. A series of experiments on datasets of varying scales demonstrates the effectiveness of GPPool.",

        "abstract": "We propose an equity-aware GRA ph-fusion differentiable P ooling neural network to accurately predict the spatio-temporal urban mobility (e.g., station-level bike usage in terms of departures and arrivals) with E quity ( GRAPE ). GRAPE consists of two independent hierarchical graph neural networks for two mobility systems â one as a target graph (i.e., a bike sharing system) and the other as an auxiliary graph (e.g., a taxi system). We have designed a convolutional fusion mechanism to jointly fuse the target and auxiliary graph embeddings and extract the shared spatial and temporal mobility patterns within the embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. To further improve the equity of bike sharing systems for diverse communities, we focus on the bike resource allocation and model prediction performance, and propose to regularize the predicted bike resource as well as the accuracy across advantaged and disadvantaged communities, and thus mitigate the potential unfairness in the predicted bike sharing usage. Our evaluation of over 23 million bike rides and 100 million taxi trips in New York City and Chicago has demonstrated GRAPE to outperform all of the baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy (by 15.80% for NYC and 50.55% for Chicago on average) and social equity awareness (by 32.44% and 24.43% in terms of resource fairness for NYC and Chicago, and 13.36% and 16.52% in terms of performance fairness).",

        "abstract": "Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for urban traffic management. Spatial-temporal graph neural networks, which combine graph neural networks with time series processing, have been extensively employed in traffic prediction. However, traditional graph neural networks only capture pairwise spatial relationships between road network nodes, neglecting high-order interactions among multiple nodes. Meanwhile, most work for extracting temporal dependencies suffers from implicit modeling and overlooks the internal and external dependencies of time series. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Algebraic Multi-order Graph Neural Network (GA-MGNN). Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design a convolution kernel based on the rotation matrix of geometric algebra, which not only learns internal dependencies between different time steps in time series but also external dependencies between time series and convolution kernels. In the spatial dimension, we construct a tokenized hypergraph and integrate dynamic graph convolution with attention hypergraph convolution to comprehensively capture multi-order spatial dependencies. Additionally, we design a segmented loss function based on traffic periodic information to further improve prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that GAMGNN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines",

        "abstract": "Federated multi-armed bandits extend the multi-armed bandits framework to the federated learning setting where multiple clients in the same exploration space collaboratively identify the optimal arm. While previous studies demonstrated its efficiency like classical federated learning, in this paper, we present the first work that reveals the serious fairness problem in federated multi-armed bandits when clients have heterogeneous and overlapping armsets. The fairness problem happens because clients with different trial requirements should conduct different numbers of trials summing up to a global requirement, but they wish to minimize their exploration effort. To address the novel fairness concern, we formally formulate the fairness-aware trial assignment as a coalitional game. Based on the theoretically derived trial requirements, we devise a Shapley value-based trial assignment mechanism to guarantee fairness. Regardless of the #P-hard complexity when deriving the general Shapley value, we achieve an accurate computation of trial assignment with polynomial complexity by exploiting its unique characteristic. We further carefully control the numbers of trials in each iteration to resolve the communication bottleneck and minimize the wasted trials. Experiment results show that, compared to the naÃ¯ve federated scheme, our design outperforms with both high fairness metrics and high efficiency in total trials and communication.",

        "abstract": "Transformers-based trackers offer significant potential for integrating semantic interdependence between template and search features in tracking tasks. Transformers possess inherent capabilities for processing long sequences and extracting correlations within them. Several researchers have explored the feasibility of incorporating Transformers to model continuously changing search areas in tracking tasks. However, their approach has substantially increased the computational cost of an already resource-intensive Transformer. Additionally, existing Transformers-based trackers rely solely on mechanically employing multi-head attention to obtain representations in different subspaces, without any inherent bias. To address these challenges, we propose HEART (Historical Information Embedding And Subspace Re-weighting Tracker). Our method embeds historical information into the queries in a lightweight and Markovian manner to extract discriminative attention maps for robust tracking. Furthermore, we develop a multi-head attention distribution mechanism to retrieve the most promising subspace weights for tracking tasks. HEART has demonstrated its effectiveness on five datasets, including OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123, TrackingNet, and GOT-10 k.",

        "abstract": "Abstractive summarization has made significant progress in recent years, which aims to generate a concise and coherent summary that contains the most important facts from the source document. Current fine-tuning approaches based on pre-training models typically rely on autoregressive and maximum likelihood estimation, which may result in inconsistent historical distributions generated during the training and inference stages, i.e., exposure bias problem. To alleviate this problem, we propose a hybrid fine-tuning model(HyFit), which combines contrastive learning and reinforcement learning in a diverse sampling space. Firstly, we introduce reparameterization and probability-based sampling methods to generate a set of summary candidates called candidates bank, which improves the diversity and quality of the decoding sampling space and incorporates the potential for uncertainty. Secondly, hybrid fine-tuning with sampled candidates bank, upweighting confident summaries and downweighting unconfident ones. Experiments demonstrate that HyFit significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SAMSum and DialogSum. HyFit also shows good performance on low-resource summarization, on DialogSum dataset, using only approximate 8% of the examples exceed the performance of the base model trained on all examples.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of an organism provides key insights into its cellular and molecular functionalities, signaling pathways and underlying disease mechanisms. For any organism, the total unexplored protein interactions significantly outnumbers all known positive and negative interactions. For Human, all known PPI datasets contain only â¼ 5.61 million positive and â¼ 0.76 million negative interactions, which is â¼ 3.1% of potential interactions. We have implemented a distributed algorithm in Apache Spark that evaluates a Human PPI network of â¼ 180 million potential interactions resulting from 18 994 reviewed proteins for which Gene Ontology (GO) annotations are available. The computed scores have been validated against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.FuzzyPPI performed significantly better with an average F1 score of 0.62 compared to GOntoSim (0.39), GOGO (0.38), and Wang (0.38) when tested with the Gold Standard PPI Dataset. The resulting scores are published with a web server for non-commercial use at http://fuzzyppi.mimuw.edu.pl/ . Moreover, conventional PPI prediction methods produce binary results, but in fact this is just a simplification as PPIs have strengths or probabilities and recent studies show that protein binding affinities may prove to be effective in detecting protein complexes, disease association analysis, signaling network reconstruction, etc. Keeping these in mind, our algorithm is based on a fuzzy semantic scoring function and produces probabilities of interaction.",

        "abstract": "MoirÃ© patterns in recaptured screen images are image defects that can affect image quality to an extreme extent. Different from other image defects, moirÃ© artefacts can vary greatly in scales, colours and shapes. Such moirÃ© patterns mix with image content and disturb image features of different scales in different ways, making moirÃ© pattern removal a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel divide-and-conquer strategy to solve the problem. In the divide stage, we innovatively decompose images into different layers, as well as into structure components and detail components. Then in the conquer stage, guided by the layers retrieved from the divide stage, we can restore coarse and fine image components independently, which greatly improve the demoirÃ©ing performance. Our strategy outperforms state-of-arts in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous hypergraph neural networks are powerful tools to capture complex correlations among various nodes in Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs). Despite satisfied performances of them, they are still plagued by the following problems: (1) They cannot capture the correlations in structural and semantic view at once, leading to topological information loss. (2) Due to the number of nodes being greater than the number of node types, node-level self-attention they used causes massive parameters and leads to high time consumption. (3) Interactions in meta-paths may be redundant, resulting in the correlations bias. To address the three issues, we propose an efficient M ulti- V iew H eterogeneous H yper g raph C onvolutional N etwork (MVH $^{2}$ GCN). It first constructs relational and semantic hypergraphs based on different types of edges and meta-paths respectively, to represent the complex correlations in structural view and semantic view. Meanwhile, the clean semantic hypergraphs are generated by structure learning network to avoid redundancy. Then, an efficient hypergraph convolutional network is designed to learn node embeddings. By doing so, correlations in the two views are captured. Finally, the learned node embeddings from two views are aggregated via a gated embedding fusion module for downstream tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that MVH $^{2}$ GCN is effective and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Transfer-based adversarial attacks involve generating adversarial point clouds in surrogate models and transferring them to other models to assess 3D model robustness. However, current methods rely too much on surrogate model parameters, limiting transferability. In this work, we use Shapley value to identify positive and negative features, guiding optimization of adversarial noise in feature space. To effectively mislead the 3D classifier, we factorize the adversarial noise into positive and negative noise, with the former keeping the features of the adversarial point cloud close to the negative features, and the latter and the adversarial noise moving it away from the positive features. Finally, a novel adversarial point cloud attack method with Adversarial Noise Factorization is proposed, which is abbreviated as ANF . ANF simultaneously optimizes the adversarial noise and its positive and negative noise in the feature space, only relying on partial network parameters, which significantly reduces the reliance on the surrogate model and improves the transferability of the adversarial point cloud. Experiments on well-recognized benchmark datasets show that the transferability of adversarial point clouds generated by ANF could be improved by more than 26.7% on average over state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attack methods.",

        "abstract": "In the investment industry, it is often essential to carry out fine-grained company similarity quantification for a range of purposes, including market mapping, competitor analysis, and mergers and acquisitions. We propose and publish a knowledge graph, named CompanyKG, to represent and learn diverse company features and relations. Specifically, 1.17 million companies are represented as nodes enriched with company description embeddings; and 15 different inter-company relations result in 51.06 million weighted edges. To enable a comprehensive assessment of methods for company similarity quantification, we have devised and compiled three evaluation tasks with annotated test sets: similarity prediction, competitor retrieval and similarity ranking. We present extensive benchmarking results for 11 reproducible predictive methods categorized into three groups: node-only, edge-only, and node+edge. To the best of our knowledge, CompanyKG is the first large-scale heterogeneous graph dataset originating from a real-world investment platform, tailored for quantifying inter-company similarity",

        "abstract": "With the growing popularity of cloud services, companies and individuals outsource images to cloud servers to reduce storage and computing burdens. The images are encrypted before outsourcing for privacy protection. It has become urgent to solve the privacy-preserving image retrieval problem on the cloud. There are three main challenges in this area. First, how can we achieve high retrieval accuracy on the encryption domain? Second, how can we improve efficiency in large-scale encrypted image retrieval? Third, how can we ensure the reliability of the retrieval results? The existing schemes only consider some of these characteristics and the retrieval accuracy is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving large-scale image retrieval framework with vision graph convolutional neural network hashing (ViGH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that is able to address all the above challenges with more advanced accuracy performance. To be specific, cycle-consistent adversarial networks and vision graph convolutional networks (ViG) are utilized to increase retrieval accuracy. By embedding encrypted images into hash codes, we can obtain high retrieval efficiency by Hamming distances. Cloud servers store the hash codes on the blockchain (Ethereum). The retrieval algorithm on the smart contracts and the consensus mechanism of blockchain ensure reliability of the retrieval results. The experimental results on three common datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving image retrieval framework. The reliability of the retrieval results is ensured by the consensus mechanism of blockchain with no need for verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/ViGH .",

        "abstract": "Social events reflect the dynamics of society and, here, natural disasters and emergencies receive significant attention. The timely detection of these events can provide organisations and individuals with valuable information to reduce or avoid losses. However, due to the complex heterogeneities of the content and structure of social media, existing models can only learn limited information; large amounts of semantic and structural information are ignored. In addition, due to high labour costs, it is rare for social media datasets to include high-quality labels, which also makes it challenging for models to learn information from social media. In this study, we propose two hyperbolic graph representation-based methods for detecting social events from heterogeneous social media environments. For cases where a dataset has labels, we design a H yperbolic S ocial E vent D etection (HSED) model that converts complex social information into a unified social message graph. This model addresses the heterogeneity of social media, and, with this graph, the information in social media can be used to capture structural information based on the properties of hyperbolic space. For cases where the dataset is unlabelled, we design an U nsupervised H yperbolic S ocial E vent D etection (UHSED). This model is based on the HSED model but includes graph contrastive learning to make it work in unlabelled scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "Accurate sleep staging is crucial for the diagnosis of diseases such as sleep disorders. Existing sleep staging models with excellent performance are usually large and require a lot of computational resources, limiting their application on wearable devices. Therefore, it is a key issue to distil the knowledge embedded in large models into small heterogeneous models for better deployment. In the process of knowledge distillation of heterogeneous models for sleep EEG signals, we mainly deal with three major challenges: 1) There are large structural differences between heterogeneous sleep staging models; 2) What kind of knowledge should be conveyed in sleep EEG signals in the knowledge distillation of heterogeneous models; 3) Significant scale differences exist between heterogeneous models. To address these challenges, we design a generic heterogeneous model knowledge distillation framework for sleep staging. Specifically, we first propose a knowledge distillation strategy for heterogeneous models that addresses the large structural differences between heterogeneous models. Then, a multi-level knowledge distillation module is designed to effectively transfer important multi-level feature knowledge. In addition, the teacher assistant module is introduced to ease the scale difference between the heterogeneous models which further enhances the knowledge distillation performance. Experimental results on both Sleep-EDF and ISRUC datasets show that our distillation framework achieves state-of the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Carbon neutrality policies stimulate hydrogen technologies, making fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) a potential solution for efficient travel. The integration of advanced energy management strategies (EMSs) into FCEVs can tap into the energy-saving potential of the nonlinear powertrain across diverse driving environments. In this paper, a novel data-driven model-predictive-control(MPC)-based energy management strategy with a dual-model framework (DDMPC) is proposed for FCEVs to substantially enhance economic performance while maintaining control robustness. Firstly, to improve the control robustness, a dual-model framework for MPC, constituted by a nominal and a practical system, is established. Next, the nominal system is constructed using a mathematical equivalent circuit model with precise internal parameters. Subsequently, a Gaussian process (GP) capable of real-time application is employed to establish the practical system, which aids in accurately predicting state transitions within the predictive horizons, thus bolstering tolerance against external disturbances. Additionally, a novel control input fusion function is designed to be integrated into DDMPC. It is purposed to cooperatively process the control vectors of both subsystems, thereby effectively merging the control inputs to enhance the economic performance of the powertrain. Finally, the simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests evaluate the energy-saving potential and the feasibility of the proposed DDMPC strategy.",

        "abstract": "Relying on a data-driven methodology, deep learning has emerged as a new approach for dynamic resource allocation in large-scale cellular networks. This paper proposes a knowledge-assisted domain adversarial network to reduce the number of poorly performing base stations (BSs) by dynamically allocating radio resources to meet real-time mobile traffic needs. Firstly, we calculate theoretical inter-cell interference and BS capacity using Voronoi tessellation and stochastic geometry, which are then incorporated into a neural network as key parameters. Secondly, following the practical assessment, a performance classifier evaluates BS performance based on given traffic-resource pairs as either poor or good. Most importantly, we use well-performing BSs as source domain data to reallocate the resources of poorly performing ones through the domain adversarial neural network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed knowledge-assisted domain adversarial resource allocation (KDARA) strategy effectively decreases the number of poorly performing BSs in the cellular network, and in turn, outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of both the ratio of poor BSs and radio resource consumption.",

        "abstract": "Deterministic transmission refers to the guaranteed delivery of data to its destination within a specific time frame along an optimal route, making it an indispensable prerequisite for the operation of autonomous vehicles. The in-vehicle networks (IVNs) face significant challenges in the deterministic transmission of large volumes of perception and control data from and to various vehicle components. In this paper, the cooperative scheduling and routing problem among multi-area control units (ACUs) in IVN is discussed from the view of deterministic transmission, and a ResVmix method is proposed to find the optimal two-layer assignment with ACU cooperation. The multi-cycle queuing and forwarding (multi-CQF) mechanism is employed to schedule the perceived data according to different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The cooperation among multiple ACUs enables deterministic routing of data. The two-layer optimization problems on multi-CQF and ACU are formulated as a+ decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDP) and solved using the enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method. Simulation results demonstrate that ResVmix significantly enhances the deterministic transmission performance of IVN. Compared to traditional shortest path algorithms and state-of-the-art MADRL methods, ResVmix achieves a 22.4% increase in arrival rate and a 20.1% increase in confirmed arrivals, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Most RGB-T trackers heavily rely on bottom-up attention and thus overlook top-down cross-modal guidance for learning target features. Consequently, the discriminative power of the learnt target features is weak. To address this issue, we propose a novel RGB-T tracker (called TGTrack) that designs a Top-down Cross-modal Guidance mechanism to learn target features in two stages. In the first stage, our TGTrack effectively generates top-down cross-modal guidance signals with multi-modal encoders-decoders and prior vectors. In the second stage, these signals are transmitted and integrated to improve the discriminative power of our target features by the attention layers of the cross-modal encoders. Moreover, we introduce an Attention-Driven Spatio-Temporal Updater for updating discriminative target features. Through cross-frame attention guidance, it can effectively eliminates irrelevant features within the search region. As a result, our TGTrack can effectively avoid the complex multi-modal fusion modules and thus achieve robust RGB-T tracking. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks (i.e., LasHeR, RGBT234, and RGBT210) demonstrate that our TGTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performances.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the sparrow search algorithm is extended to multi-objective sparrow search algorithm (MOSSA) with the purpose of efficiently solving the multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). Firstly, the MOSSA adaptively evaluates non-dominated sparrow individuals stored in the external archive by using an adaptive mesh approach, which is utilized to obtain the best producer. Secondly, the scrounger sparrows adjust their trajectories according to the location of the best producer, called the scrounger follow strategy, which can improve the quality of the solutions when solving MOPs. Then, the proposed scouter search strategy is capable of maintaining population diversity and accelerate convergence. Moreover, the external archive is pruned with the aim of avoiding the waste of computing resources. Extensive experiments with 22 benchmark examples validate the effectiveness of our approach against six state-of-the-art optimization approaches. Finally, the MOSSA is applied in the carbon fiber drawing process problems and the stretching parameters obtained by the MOSSA is reasonable.",

        "abstract": "Decorrelation of multichannel signals has played a crucial preprocessing role (in prewhitening and orthogonalization) for many signal processing applications. Classical decorrelation techniques can only be applied for signal vectors. Nonetheless, many emerging big-data and sensor-network applications involve signal tensors (signal samples required to be arranged in a tensor form of arbitrary orders). Meanwhile, the existing tensor-decorrelation methods have serious limitations. First, the correlation-tensors have to be of certain particular orders. Second, the unrealistic assumption of the specific signal-tensor form, namely the canonical polyadic (CP) form, is made. Third, the correlation-tensor has to be full-rank or an extra preprocessor based on principal component analysis is required for any non-full-rank correlation tensor. To remove the aforementioned impractical limitations, we propose a novel robust approach for high-dimensional multichannel decorrelation, which can accommodate signal tensors of arbitrary orders, forms, and ranks without any need of extra preprocessor. In this work, we introduce two new tensor-decorrelation algorithms. Our first new algorithm is designed to tackle full-rank correlation-tensors and our second new algorithm is designed to tackle non-full-rank correlation-tensors. Meanwhile, we also propose a new parallel-computing paradigm to accelerate our proposed new tensor-decorrelation algorithms. To demonstrate the applicability of our proposed new scheme, we also apply our proposed new tensor-decorrelation approach to pre-whiten the tensor signals and analyze the corresponding convergence-speed and misadjustment performances of the tensor least-mean-squares (TLMS) filter. Finally, we assess the computational- and memory-complexities of our proposed new algorithms by simulations over both artificial and real data. Simulation results show that our proposed new multichannel-decorrelation algorithms outperform the existing tensor-decorrel...",

        "abstract": "Attributed network embedding seeks to depict each network node via a compact, low-dimensional vector while effectively preserving the similarity between node pairs, which lays a strong foundation for a great many high-level network mining tasks. With the advent of the era of big data, the number of nodes and edges has reached billions in many real-world networks, which poses great computational and storage challenges to the existing methods. Although some algorithms have been developed to handle billion-scale networks, they often undergo accuracy degradation or tempo-spatial inefficiency owing to attribute information loss or substantial parameter learning. To this end, we propose a simple, time- and space-efficient billion-scale attributed network embedding algorithm called SketchBANE in this paper, which strikes an excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency by adopting sparse random projection with 1-bit quantization to sketch the iterative closed neighborhood and maintain the similarity among high-order nodes in a non-learning manner. The extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed SketchBANE algorithm competes favorably with the state-of-the-art approaches, while remarkably reducing runtime and space consumption. Also, the proposed SketchBANE algorithm exhibits good scalability and parallelization.",

        "abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a significant role by collecting and analyzing real-time data on consumer behavior, product availability, and other environmental factors, thus enhancing e-commerce operations. Researchers in the domain of consumer electronics are working actively to increase the sustainability of WSNs and decrease their ecological footprint by developing energy-efficient algorithms, data compression techniques, and sensor designs. These advancements are directed toward optimizing energy consumption and minimizing environmental consequences while ensuring the smooth functionality of IoT applications. Organizations are emphasizing the need for collaboration between designers, business organizations, developers, and regulatory authorities to implement eco-friendly industrial laws to enhance the effectiveness of the e-commerce industry. Decision-making in the e-commerce sector is complicated by information overload, subjectivity of preferences, trust issues, product variety, lack of personalized assistance, return and exchange concerns, dynamic pricing and discounts, limited sensory experience, and complex decision-making processes. To address these challenges, an entropy-based multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to assist personalization in e-commerce and improve user interfaces, recommendation systems, product information transparency, and consumer trust. The utilization of the MCDM technique facilitates the customization of electronic commerce platforms, whereby affordable products can be identified and retrieved according to individual user preferences. The study investigates the impact of electronic gadgets and energy-efficient WSNs on inventory management, customer preferences, and online shopping sustainability, highlighting the intricate relationship between data privacy, energy efficiency, and governance. The proposed method is compared to other state-of-the-art methodolo...",

        "abstract": "Erasure coding is a common redundancy scheme to provide higher reliability with much lower storage overhead compared to replication. It prevents data loss due to failures but induces high repair costs. As data volumes grow exponentially, wide stripes are proposed for extreme storage savings. Wide-stripe erasure codes face the challenges of higher repair costs for single and multiple failures. Our extensive analysis shows that existing repair-efficient erasure codes, such as locally repairable codes (LRCs) and minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, are insufficient to meet all the requirements of wide stripes: low storage overhead, low repair cost for both single and multiple failures, and high reliability. In this article, we explore an alternative code scheme, locally repairable with zigzag code (LRZC), which combines the advantages of LRCs and zigzag codes. LRZC divides data blocks and global parity blocks into evenly sized local groups, and generates two local parity blocks by a zigzag code in each group. Under the limit of storage overhead of wide stripes, LRZC reduces the repair cost for single and multiple failures and provides higher reliability compared with existing wide-stripe codes. Experiments show that LRZC reduces the repair cost of single and multiple failures by up to 41.9% and 41.7% compared with the state-of-the-art LRCs.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of medical imaging data, radiologists must dedicate a significant amount of time to report writing. Automated generation of radiology reports not only alleviates the heavy workload of physicians but, more importantly, can reduce mistakes and oversights caused by insufficient experience. However, due to substantial data bias in medical data, prior studies using typical cross-entropy loss in encoder-decoder architectures often result in generalized descriptions of normal tissues and may overlook crucial clinical abnormalities. Therefore, we propose a clustering enhanced contrastive learning model named CECL to generate more diverse radiology reports, and it is worth noting that our method is end-to-end trainable. Specifically, an adaptive alignment fusion encoder-decoder network (AAF) is constructed by fusing the image features and text semantic features from the transformer decoder, eliminating information redundancy across different modalities. Moreover, a label-guided contrastive learning (LCL) module is proposed. In detail, clustering is performed on the fused features using Gaussian competition. Supervised contrastive learning is conducted based on the clustering results to enhance feature representation ability. We evaluate the CECL on two widely used publicly available datasets, IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR, using NLG and CE metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that CECL can produce fluent reports with more descriptions of anomalies, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods with higher clinical correctness.",

        "abstract": "Due to complex environmental factors, the position measurement data of mobile robots are susceptible to pollution from multiplicative noise and non-Gaussian characteristics, which poses a challenge for the existing adaptive filtering methods to obtain high-performance pose estimation. Based on the comprehensive consideration of non-Gaussian multiplicative noise and correlated noise, a non-Gaussian adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter design method based on Gaussian sum and maximum correntropy techniques is proposed. Firstly, an enhanced Gaussian-sum and Cubature Kalman Filter method is designed to re-derive the innovation covariance and cross-variance for the multiplicative noise system. Secondly, under the framework of the maximum correntropy filter, the design strategy of the Gaussian kernel function weight matrix is improved, and a Cubature Kalman Filter method based on the improved maximum correntropy criterion is proposed. Then, based on consideration of the correlation between multiplicative noise and measurement noise, a Gaussian sum maximum correntropy Cubature Kalman Filter method with a known correlation coefficient is established. Finally, an adaptive Gaussian sum maximum correntropy Cubature Kalman Filter method that can dynamically estimate the correlation coefficient of multiplicative noise in real time is proposed, which can perform joint high-performance estimation of mobile robotâs pose and correlation coefficient. Note to Practitioners âThis paper focuses on nonlinear multiplicative noise systems which are non-Gaussian. On one hand, non-Gaussian multiplication noise is pervasive in all types of systems, seriously affecting signal transmission and data acquisition. On the other hand, the correlation between multiplicative noise and measurement noise will seriously affect filter accuracy and create new challenges. Particularly, as it is difficult to obtain the correlation coefficient in the current system, the method to estimate the correlation coefficie...",

        "abstract": "Integrating diverse biomedical knowledge information is essential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses, facilitate personalized treatment plans, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. However, Biomedical Information Integration (BII) faces significant challenges due to variations in terminology and the complex structure of entity descriptions across different datasets. A critical step in BII is biomedical entity alignment, which involves accurately identifying and matching equivalent entities across diverse datasets to ensure seamless data integration. In recent years, Large Language Model (LLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs), have emerged as valuable tools for discerning heterogeneous biomedical data due to their deep contextual embeddings and bidirectionality. However, different LLMs capture various nuances and complexity levels within the biomedical data, and none of them can ensure their effectiveness in all heterogeneous entity matching tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel Two-Stage LLM construction (TSLLM) framework to adaptively select and combine LLMs for Biomedical Information Integration (BII). First, a Multi-Objective Genetic Programming (MOGP) algorithm is proposed for generating versatile high-level LLMs, and then, a Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm (SOGA) employs a confidence-based strategy is presented to combine the built LLMs, which can further improve the discriminative power of distinguishing heterogeneous entities. The experiment utilizes OAEI's entity matching datasets, i.e., Benchmark and Conference, along with LargeBio, Disease and Phenotype datasets to test the performance of TSLLM. The experimental findings validate the efficiency of TSLLM in adaptively differentiating heterogeneous biomedical entities, which significantly outperforms the leading entity matching techniques.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic event-triggered (DET) bipartite consensus and attack estimation problem is investigated for multi-agent systems (MASs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks generated by exogenous systems. For the purpose of compensating for the system bias, a novel set of estimators are introduced to estimate the FDI attacks. To optimize the limited resources of the network bandwidth, a DET protocol dependant on the auxiliary variable and the local estimations is employed to regulate data transmission. By employing the designed state observer and attack observer, an novel attack tolerant event-triggered control strategy is established. Subsequently, sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the bipartite consensus performance with $l_2$ - $l_{\\infty}$ constraint. Then, by solving algebraic matrix equations and recursive linear matrix inequalities (LMI), the gains of state estimator, attack estimator and desired controller are determined, respectively. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the derived results. Note to Practitioners âThis paper discusses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for MASs subject to FDI attacks. Since the system state deviation caused by FDI attacks will bring about degradation of system performance, it is important to protect the MASs from being destroyed by designing observers to estimate the FDI attack and the system state. In view of the bandwidth constraints among the agents in MASs, optimization utilization of the network bandwidth should be taken into account seriously. Therefore, in this paper, the proposed observer-based DET controller is developed to guarantee bipartite consensus of the considered MASs while ensuring efficiency utilization of bandwidth resources. The current research provides a helpful reference for the secure bipartite consensus control of MASs with bandwidth constraints.",

        "abstract": "An efficient higher-order (HO) perfectly matched layer (PML) algorithm based on the direct integration (DI) method is proposed for terminating finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grids. Unlike the vast majority of HO-PML formulas where the spatial differentiation terms have coefficients associated with the PML parameters, the proposed HO-PML is derived by rearranging the PML tensors and converting the update formulas into the sum of the standard FDTD formulas and the PML auxiliary variables. Consequently, the proposed HO-PML is fully independent of the host media in the FDTD computational domain at the code level and is named the DI-HO-iPML, with the letter âiâ indicating this characteristic. In addition, by splitting the HO difference equation according to each time step, an algorithm to reduce the memory footprint of the HO difference equation is proposed for the first time and applied to the DI-HO-iPML algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that the DI-HO-iPML has the advantages of time-saving and universality. An unmagnetized plasma half-space problem is simulated to validate the DI-HO-iPML.",

        "abstract": "Fruit counting is a fundamental task for fruit yield estimation. Though semi-supervised counting methods have received increased attention in recent years, due to the high data utilization of unlabeled data, they suffer from two limitations. Firstly, difficult weight selection is a limitation, as these methods rely on manually selected fixed weights for both the supervised learning loss and the consistency learning loss, resulting in limited performance. Secondly, biased pseudo-labeling is another limitation, as they may predict biased pseudo-labels that result in small consistency learning losses, leading to training being dominated by supervised learning with large losses. To tackle these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel method named ParetoSSL to automatically derive weights of losses from the perspective of multi-task learning. Specifically, ParetoSSL formulates a multi-objective optimization problem for weight derivation by maximizing the similarity between weighted gradients of losses and a customized gradient preference vector, in which, the vector can guide weight derivation. Moreover, to relieve the effect of pseudo-label biases on consistency learning, we propose a bias-aware gradient preference vector. This vector considers gradient biases brought by the pseudo-label biases, which will down-weight the supervised learning loss while high-weighting the consistency learning loss. Meanwhile, to improve the robustness of ParetoSSL, an inequality equation regarding the norm of the gradients of the consistency learning loss is designed to control the range of gradient biases. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Clustered-Fruit dataset and Fruit-2019 dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of ParetoSSL on semi-supervised counting. Experimental results show that our ParetoSSL is superior to state-of-the-art methods. Note to Practitioners âThis work is motivated by the emerging need for semi-supervised counting methods in fruit yield estimati...",

        "abstract": "Rating prediction is a challenging task in review-aware recommendation. Although current methods effectively combine collaborative signals with review data, they fail to differentiate user preferences across various ratings and overlook the independence between these ratings. In this article, we emphasize the importance of independence modeling among representations for different rating levels. To this end, we propose a rating-oriented explicit disentangling graph convolution network for review-aware recommendation, short for REDGCN. Specifically, we introduce a rating-oriented disentangled representation learning that segments representations and rating graph based on ratings. It also employs an explicit graph learning approach to ensure the independence of disentangled representations during information propagation, which mitigates noise from review features. Furthermore, we define and model one kind of cross-rating correlation, based on the characteristics of user rating behavior. By leveraging this approach, we introduce a cross-rating constraint as an additional task to further enhance the independence among disentangled representations and improve the stability of model training. We conduct extensive experiments on six public datasets to prove the effectiveness of REDGCN. The complete data and codes of REDGCN are available at https://github.com/hfutmars/REDGCN",

        "abstract": "The Internet-of-Vehicles offers a comprehensive perception of environment, which enhance transportation efficiency. To handle the large amount of collected data, distributed edge intelligence is a promising paradigm in which the edge server share data and computing resources with each other, providing low latency services for local devices. However, offloading the computing-intensive application fully to one edge server might lead to a large latency as the computing resource of edge servers are usually limited. To solve this problem and elevate Quality of Service (QoS) to new heights, existing methodologies merely partition applications into modules, overlooking the crucial fact that these modules harbor distinct input requirements, posing a pivotal challenge in scheduling optimization. In this paper, we study dependent task offloading by partitioning applications and dividing modules into two categories: 1) stateful modules and 2) statelss modules. The stateful modules necessitate the incorporation of previous calculation results, while stateless modules operate independently. We subsequently frame this intricate dependent task offloading challenge as an optimization problem, boldly acknowledging its NP-hard nature. Considering this, we unveil an innovative Online Collaborative Dependent Task Offloading (OCDTO) algorithm, grounded in a two-layer collaborative edge computing architecture. This algorithm meticulously minimizes the make-span, redefining the benchmarks for efficiency. Our rigorous experimentation not only validates but also showcases the superiority of our approach, consistently achieving the lowest average system cost compared to the state-of-the-art, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed approach in latency-sensitive and computing-intensive scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and eye movement signals, which represent internal physiological responses and external subconscious behaviors, respectively, have been shown to be reliable indicators for recognizing emotions. However, integrating these two modalities across multiple subjects presents several challenges: 1) designing a robust consistency metric that balances the consistency and divergences between heterogeneous modalities across multiple subjects; 2) simultaneously considering intra-modality and inter-modality information across multiple subjects; and 3) overcoming individual differences among multiple subjects and generating subject-invariant representations of the multimodal fused features. To address these challenges associated with multisource data (i.e., multiple modalities and subjects), we propose a novel comprehensive multisource learning network (CMSLNet) for cross-subject multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, an instance-level adaptive robust consistency metric is first designed to better align the information between EEG signals and eye movement signals, identifying their consistency and divergences across various emotions. Subsequently, an attentive low-rank multimodal fusion (Att-LMF) method is developed to account for individual differences and dynamically learn intra-modality and inter-modality information, resulting in highly discriminative fused features. Finally, domain generalization is utilized to extract subject-invariant representations of the fused features, thus adapting to new subjects and enhancing the model's generalization. Through these elaborate designs, CMSLNet effectively incorporates the information from multisource data, thus significantly improving the accuracy and reliability of emotion recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CMSLNet. CMSLNet achieves high accuracies of 83.15% on the SEED-IV dataset and 87.32% on the SEED-V dataset, surpassing t...",

        "abstract": "Object detection and tracking is always a challenging issue in UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) application. Especially, in the scene of UAV-ASV (autonomous surface vehicle) cooperative system, UAV vision based target tracking performance has been suffering from the target rotation and fast motion. Aiming at optimizing the related UAV vision tracking performance, a SDSST tracker(strong discriminative scale space tracking) with automatic initialization and self-adjusting is developed in this paper. Firstly, in the step of initialization, combining the advantages of both fast optimization of BLS (Broad Learning System) and efficient image processing of CNN (convolutional neural networks), a novel DBLS (Deep Broad Learning System) is posed for the target detection. Meanwhile, a Q-learning based DBLS architecture searching is further introduced. Then, in terms of width/height ratio self-adjusting, this article proposed a novel filter state supervisor that helps to find the abnormal estimated state caused by rotation in target scale estimation. Basically, this so called filter state supervisor could take RSV (Rolling Standard Value) as input feature and give out the filter state. Finally, the abnormal filter state would be adjusted by an appropriate alternative by searching in the proposed rotation angles memory, so that an optimized self-adjusting could be realized. Meanwhile, extensive experiments are performed on data set of USV center in Qiandao Lake, yielding a competitive result compared with five other prevalent trackers. Note to Practitioners âThis paper was motivated by the problem of target lost caused by sudden change of target motion in the UAV-ASV vision tracking. Usually, the rotation motion of ASV is a major operation when ASV carries out a maritime assignment. However, the poor tracking state supervision and inflexible scale updating method as well as manual initialization in the existing approaches lead to inappropriate scale and target lost when the targe...",

        "abstract": "Geometry- and appearance-controlled full-body human image generation is an interesting but challenging task. Existing solutions are either unconditional or dependent on coarse conditions (e.g., pose, text), thus lacking explicit geometry and appearance control of body and garment. Sketching offers such editing ability and has been adopted in various sketch-based face generation and editing solutions. However, directly adapting sketch-based face generation to full-body generation often fails to produce high-fidelity and diverse results due to the high complexity and diversity in the pose, body shape, and garment shape and texture. Recent geometrically controllable diffusion-based methods mainly rely on prompts to generate appearance. It is hard to balance the realism and the faithfulness of their results to the sketch when the input is coarse. This work presents Sketch2Human, the first system for controllable full-body human image generation guided by a semantic sketch (for geometry control) and a reference image (for appearance control). Our solution is based on the latent space of StyleGAN-Human with inverted geometry and appearance latent codes as input. Specifically, we present a sketch encoder trained with a large synthetic dataset sampled from StyleGAN-Human's latent space and directly supervised by sketches rather than real images. Considering the entangled information of partial geometry and texture in StyleGAN-Human and the absence of disentangled datasets, we design a novel training scheme that creates geometry-preserved and appearance-transferred training data to tune a generator to achieve disentangled geometry and appearance control. Although our method is trained with synthetic data, it can also handle hand-drawn sketches. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "In expensive multi/many-objective optimization problems (EMOPs), the expensive objectives are generally accessed through different simulation tools, leading to different evaluation latencies and unbearable computational time for serial optimization. One promising approach to improve efficiency is to perform simulation and build surrogates separately for each objective in parallel. However, how to improve the model accuracy and select promising candidates without global information are big challenges. To alleviate these problems, this article proposes an asynchronous influence-based SAEA (AIEA) based on the client-server model. Each client approximates an objective and the server takes charge for evolution. To adaptively select promising candidates, the influence degree is introduced in candidate selection, which is calculated in the objective space to judge which candidate has more beneficial influence for evolution. With the selected candidate, the most-uncertain-first strategy is devised in objective selection for asynchronous evaluations and model improvement. To handle incomplete objective values, the nearest neighbor inheritance is adopted for unevaluated objectives. Comprehensive experiments compared with five surrogate-assisted EAs demonstrate the global optimization and scalability of AIEA.",

        "abstract": "The ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL) neural network has demonstrated the ability to address the limitations of conventional artificial neural networks. However, since edRVFL generates features for its hidden layers through random projection, it can potentially lose intricate features or fail to capture certain non-linear features in its base models (hidden layers). To enhance the feature learning capabilities of edRVFL, we propose a novel edRVFL based on fuzzy inference system (edRVFL-FIS). The proposed edRVFL-FIS leverages the capabilities of two emerging domains, namely deep learning and ensemble approaches, with the intrinsic IF-THEN properties of fuzzy inference system (FIS) and produces rich feature representation to train the ensemble model. Each base model of the proposed edRVFL-FIS encompasses two key feature augmentation components: a) unsupervised fuzzy layer features and b) supervised defuzzified features. The edRVFL-FIS model incorporates diverse clustering methods (R-means, K-means, Fuzzy C-means) to establish fuzzy layer rules, resulting in three model variations (edRVFL-FIS-R, edRVFL-FIS-K, edRVFL-FIS-C) with distinct fuzzified features and defuzzified features. Within the framework of edRVFL-FIS, each base model utilizes the original, hidden layer and defuzzified features to make predictions. Experimental results, statistical tests, discussions and analyses conducted across UCI and NDC datasets consistently demonstrate the superior performance of all variations of the proposed edRVFL-FIS model over baseline models.",

        "abstract": "Bloom filters (BFs) are compact, probabilistic data structures designed for efficient set membership queries. They offer high query and storage efficiency, making them particularly useful in network and distributed systems. However, the scalability of BFs in accommodating âBig Dataâ is limited by increased false positive rates, inflexible hash functions, and inefficient matching with dynamic datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce the Extensible Bloom Filter (EBF), which incorporates a flexible expansion mechanism and an adaptive hash function generation scheme. The EBF design features a set of BF vectors that expand according to the rate of incoming data, with each vector sized to suit the characteristics of the data. Adaptive hash functions, derived from common base matrices, streamline the process by leveraging strong inter-hash relationships. This reduces overhead and simplifies queries across multiple BF vector sizes. Performance evaluations have shown that the EBF consistently achieves a low false positive rate and minimal query time, even amid dynamic data arrivals and large data sets. With its extensibility and adaptability, the EBF provides a robust solution for applications requiring dynamic set representations with stringent accuracy requirements. It enhances the capabilities of network and distributed systems, making them more efficient in handling complex data scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, personality has been considered as a valuable personal factor being incorporated into the provision of personalized learning. Although some studies have endeavored to obtain learners' personalities implicitly from their learning behaviors, they failed to achieve satisfactory prediction performance. On the one hand, most existing approaches ignore the imbalanced distribution of personality classes, which causes the personality classifiers to be biased toward the non-extreme personality class. On the other hand, the related methods normally focus on constructing statistical behavior features, while the sequence information of learning behaviors is ignored, but actually it can reflect learners' behavior patterns more finely. In this paper, inspired by the human learning strategy in the face of small samples, we propose an effective Demographic-Guided Behavior Patterns Contrast (DGBPC) model to classify learners' personalities through the demographic-guided contrast of learners' coarse behavior patterns. Besides, we construct and publish the Personality and Learning Behavior Dataset (PLBD), which should be one of the largest public datasets regarding Big-Five personality and learning behavior sequence according to our knowledge. The experimental results on PLBD demonstrate that our DGBPC model could generate learner representations with higher discrimination and outperform the related methods in terms of balanced accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Efficient exchange and processing of big data in wireless mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks require responsive data service provisioning. Traditional onsite spot trading of resources, which relies on real-time network conditions, can facilitate data sharing but often suffers from prohibitive delays and trading failures due to the need for timely analysis of dynamic network environments. These limitations motivate us to investigate an integrated forward and spot trading mechanism (iFAST), which is a stagewise data sharing protocol designed for uncertain MCS ecosystems. In iFAST, sellers (i.e., mobile devices) can offer long-term or temporary data services to buyers (i.e., sensing tasks). Specifically, iFAST enables the signing of long-term contracts ahead of future transactions through a forward trading mode, leveraging historical network and market statistics. It also promotes the notion of overbooking. Additionally, it allows buyers with unsatisfactory data quality to recruit temporary sellers through a spot trading mode based on current network/market conditions. We analyze the crucial components of iFAST and provide a case study to demonstrate its performance. We also summarize insights for next-generation wireless sensing and communication.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on a dynamic event-triggered adaptive neural networks backstepping control for a class of uncertain strict-feedback systems with communication constraints. The uncertain terms including external disturbances and unknown nonlinear functions are approximated by radial basis function neural networks, in which the weight update laws are obtained via the gradient descent algorithm, ensuring the local boundedness of the approximation error of neural networks. Then, to enhance the transmission efficiency of control signals, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced, which enables the dynamic adjustment of threshold parameters in response to the actual tracking performance. It is strictly proved via the Lyapunov stability criterion that the tracking error can converge to a desired small neighborhood of the origin, and all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, the validity of the control strategy is demonstrated through a simulation example. Note to Practitioners â In practical network control systems, control signals are typically transmitted continuously or periodically to devices through the communication network in the form of data packets. As communication networks are usually shared by various system nodes, and resources such as communication channel bandwidth and computational capabilities are limited, improving the transmission efficiency of control signals becomes a crucial design problem for controllers in network control systems. Therefore, This study introduces a control method via event-triggered sampling, aiming to enhance sampling efficiency while ensuring the stability and reliability of the system. The proposed control method is suitable for a broad category of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with communication constraints, offering notable advantages such as low-complexity design and straightforward implementation.",

        "abstract": "Predicting traffic is the main duty of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Precise traffic forecasts can significantly enhance the use of public funds. However, the dynamic and complex nature of spatio-temporal relationships presents significant challenges. Most current methods utilize static adjacency matrices, leading to reduced forecasting accuracy and precision. This approach fails to account for the complex spatio-temporal correlations that interact simultaneously. In order to show how different spatio-temporal correlations change over time in the traffic flow network, this study suggests a unified simultaneous Multi Fusion Graph Network (DMFGNet) model. The goal of the suggested DMFGNet model is to identify dynamic spatio-temporal linkages between various regions. Meanwhile, we propose a model, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Unit (STAU), to control the weights of neighbor aggregation. It is capable of meticulously combining spatio-temporal characteristics from different neighbors. We tested the model for both real-time and pre-processed predictions using a combination of edge and cloud infrastructure. This setup performs prediction tasks at the edge layer and conducts training in the remote cloud. This approach guarantees the use of only relevant data for model training and prediction-making, thereby boosting the systemâs overall effectiveness. This approach not only optimizes resource allocation but also aids in reducing latency and enhancing the overall performance of cloud-based prediction models, potentially enhancing the capabilities of consumer technology and electronics solutions. We carefully tested and evaluated two large real-world traffic flow datasets to show that the proposed method works and is useful. The results of the tests show that the suggested model is better than the current best baseline methods. Additionally, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the recommended strategy.",

        "abstract": "Using DNN (Deep Neural Networks) models to obtain high Quality of Services (QoS) through the cloud has become increasingly popular nowadays. Users want to use DNN by their edges (such as smartphones) anytime and anywhere. For most small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud computing resources are limited. Temporary exhaustion of resources may cause obvious service delay. For users, if all tasks are done locally, the battery capacity of the edge is too small to support such huge computing tasks. To remove this contradiction, we propose a Tensor-based Lyapunov DNN Offloading Control (TLDOC) strategy. First, we offload DNN computational tasks to cloud-fog-edge from an overall perspective. That is, layers in DNN are considered as basic offloadable objects. Second, we provide an original tensor-based Lyapunov equation and the entire process is derived in the tensor space. Lastly, we consider more key limiting factors (e.g., cellular data and remaining edge energy) to achieve better QoS. Via above contributions, our strategy reduces service delay and energy consumption for DNN cloud-fog-edge orchestration. Our experiments include two parts - detail and comparison. The experimental detail verifies that TLDOC strategy is practical and stable. Compared experiments show that our strategy could provide better QoS than existing methods on efficiency and energy saving.",

        "abstract": "Object detection is crucial in traffic scenes for accurately identifying multiple objects within complex environments. Traditional systems rely on deep learning models trained on large-scale datasets, but this approach can be expensive and impractical. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) offers a potential solution by addressing limited data availability. However, object detectors trained with FSOD frameworks often generalize poorly on classes with limited samples. Although most existing methods alleviate this problem by calibrating either the feature maps or prediction heads of the object detector, none of them, like this work, have proposed a unified, dual calibration strategy that operates in both the latent feature space and the prediction probability space of the object detector. Specifically, we propose to improve representation precision by reducing the variances of feature vectors using highly adaptive centroids learned from ensembles of training features in the latent space. These centroids are employed to calibrate the features and reveal the underlying structure of the latent feature space. Moreover, we further exploit the association between the query and support features to calibrate inaccurate predictions resulting from overfitting or underfitting when fine-tuned with few training samples and low training iterations. Through visualization, we demonstrate that our method produces more discriminative high-level features, ultimately improving the precision of an object detector's predictions. To validate the effectiveness of our approaches, we conduct comprehensive experiments on well-known benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, showing considerable performance gains compared to existing works.

        "abstract": "The paper considers the embedded system that can either compute tasks locally by itself or offload tasks to the edge server for remote computing during the running period (RP) and switch to the sleep mode to save energy once the RP ends, i.e., the idle period (IP) arrives. The tasks are stored in the cache, and the more tasks are computed during the RP, the less cache space will be occupied at the end of RP, while also leading to more energy consumption. Meanwhile, the sleep mode that the embedded system enters during the IP also influences the energy consumption. Therefore, how to make the optimal tradeoff between energy consumption and cache occupancy arises as an interesting issue. To address this issue, this paper first establishes an optimization-theoretical framework to formulate the energy consumption under the constraint of cache occupancy, then discovers the most energy-saving RP, computing mode (i.e., local or edge computing), and low-power mode. An algorithm based on our discovered theoretical results is proposed for the embedded system to minimize the energy consumption within the acceptable level of cache occupancy. Theoretical analysis and field experiments jointly verify its good performance. Note to Practitioners âThis paper addresses the interesting tradeoff between energy consumption and cache occupancy in the embedded system that operates in the environments with limited available energy as well as cache space. It facilitates to improve the operation efficiency of the embedded systems in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that employs edge computing technology to empower embedded systems with more computing capability and sleep modes to guarantee embedded systems with more energy savings, in order to minimize the accumulative energy consumption, while maintaining the cache occupancy in terms of task data bits stored within an acceptable range.

        "abstract": "For multiple smart sensors (MSSs) operating with limited energy, a smart sensor is said to be controllable if there exists proper external signal (ES) enabling it to report the sensing data, reflecting the physical world with tolerable sensing errors. In order to improve energy-efficiency while meeting the required sensing accuracy, the controllable smart sensors are expected to be activated while the uncontrollable ones are not. However, due to the exterior noises or interior interferences (ENII) of MSSs, whether a smart sensor is or not controllable is often uncertain, which may wrongly activate uncontrollable sensors or deactivate controllable ones, not only wasting energy but also deteriorating sensing errors. Therefore, addressing the problem of assuring MSSs with uncertain controllability to report tolerable sensing errors at the minimum cost of energy emerges as an interesting and challenging issue. To address this problem, this paper first formulates MSSs as the probabilistic multiple input multiple output (PMIMO) system, with all the ESs and sensing errors as the input and output, respectively. It then discloses the optimal activation probability for each smart sensor and reveals the optimal ES corresponding to the minimum energy for MSSs experiencing uncertain controllability to report the desired sensing errors. An algorithm is proposed based on our discovered results to implement such ES. The theoretical analysis and field experiments verify its performance. Note to Practitioners âThis paper addresses the challenging issue of how to guarantee MSSs experiencing uncertain controllability to report tolerable sensing errors at the minimum cost of energy. Though the insightful discovery of the optimal probability that each smart sensor is activated, and further the optimal ES corresponding to the minimum energy for enabling MSSs experiencing uncertain controllability to report the desired sensing errors, this paper facilitates MSSs with uncertain controllabi...",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we exploit the positioning results for communication, and propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for terahertz (THz) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) networks. Specifically, we derive an explicit expression for the CramÃ¨sr-Rao bound (CRB), which is used to evaluate the positioning performance. Furthermore, based on the established relationship between positioning and communication, we propose a joint beam tracking and power allocation scheme for mobile users in THz Massive MIMO networks, which minimizes the positioning error under both the data transmission outage constraint and total power constraints. Unfortunately, the joint beam tracking and power allocation optimization problem is non-convex, and intractable due to the outage constraint. To address this challenge, we decompose the non-convex problem into a beam tracking subproblem and a power allocation subproblem, and propose a proximal policy optimization beam tracking (PPO-BT) algorithm for the beam tracking subproblem and a robust power allocation (RPA) algorithm for the power allocation subproblem. Furthermore, we extend the proposed THz IPAC scheme to more practical 3-dimensional (3D) scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed THz IPAC framework can satisfy positioning and communication requirements at the same time, and our proposed methods outperform existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) server infrastructure has been built to support AI applications and handle data-intensive workloads. AI server infrastructure is the essential building blocks, and errors in AI server infrastructure may lead to fatal consequences to any AI applications built upon it. Compared to traditional software, software for AI server infrastructure is more configurable, and thus more likely to have configuration errors that might prevent correct software behaviors. Previous work on misconfiguration diagnosis requires sufficient execution history or manual intervention, and can hardly diagnose potential misconfigurations which are not triggered at launching. In this paper, we propose a real-time method to address these issues. Specifically, we combine program analysis and real-time log parsing to diagnose configuration errors. It maps each configuration option to the log code by applying program slicing only once, and parses real-time logs during the operation of the AI server without manual intervention. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the core components of Hadoop, an exemplar AI Server Infrastructure Software. The results show that our method mapped more than 80% of the configuration options to log outputs, identified 90% of the configuration read sites as the slicing seeds, and successfully diagnosed about 10% configuration errors that can not be addressed by previous studies.",

        "abstract": "Clickbait refers to deliberately enticing users into clicking through sensational text, and the corresponding content is usually totally unrelated. Recently, clickbait plays a semantic deceptive role on online web applications like news portals and social media, which will inevitably lead to user dissatisfaction and agitation. The recent clickbait detection approaches typically require large-scaled labeled data or auxiliary information like news content, however, humans can distinguish whether they are clickbaits without seeing the labeled content but only based on the titles. In this paper, we present a Clickbait Detection method that makes use of Prompt-tuning which can only leverage the few-shot labeled titles to train the detection model. Specifically, we feed the titles into the prompt template to predict the masked label, and we conducted five strategies to expand label words space for final detection. Despite being few-shot labeled titles, experimental results show that our method can obtain an obvious improvement compared to other clickbait detection methods based on deep neural networks and pre-trained language models, outperforming the state-of-the-art and up to 95% in all four metrics on three well-known benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the event-triggered platooning control of Connected Vehicle Systems (CVSs) considering denial of service (DoS) attacks, external disturbances, and unknown leader inputs. To counteract malicious attacks, a network recovery mechanism is implemented to repair the spanning tree destroyed by DoS attacks. Switching topologies containing the spanning-tree-retained cases and the spanning-tree-destroyed cases are utilized to depict cyber states during DoS attacks and recovery mechanism. To reduce data transmission in V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication, based on the switching topology model, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is further implemented to schedule the information transmission over the Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) effectively. In the absence of disturbances and leader inputs, the sufficient conditions are derived for CVSs employing the event-triggered V2V communication to achieve internal stability under DoS attacks. The constraints on the duration and frequency of the spanning tree being destroyed by the DoS attacks are derived. Furthermore, the propagation of external disturbances and unknown leader inputs along the platoon is proven to meet the prescribed\nH\nâ\nattenuation level by the Lyapunov-based methods. Finally, simulations featuring several scenarios are given to verify the theory's discoveries.",

        "abstract": "ECG (Electrocardiogram), the most commonly used tool in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases, contains a large amount of physiologic information about the electrical activity of the heart. Research on automatic diagnosis of cardiac diseases by means of computer-aided ECG diagnosis has been carried out for decades. Computer assisted therapy is able to timely detect heart diseases and reduce the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease patients. In recent years, classification algorithms applied to automatic ECG arrhythmia diagnosis have been proposed and optimized. With the application and development of neural network-based deep learning technology in automatic ECG diagnosis, the accuracy and reliability of automatic ECG arrhythmia classification have been significantly improved. This paper systematically analyzes the literatures related to the automatic classification of ECG arrhythmias, summarizes the classification algorithms of different arrhythmias based on neural network model and non-neural network model, and summarizes the classification characteristics of the two main classification models in the application of automatic diagnosis of arrhythmias under the same AAMI standard and MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. This paper summarizes the selected research results in the field of arrhythmia classification under the same database from the perspective of data quality, evaluation paradigm and performance indicators, and discusses the correlation between the specific characteristics of arrhythmia detection and different classification algorithms. Finally, the existing problems in the research of automatic classification of arrhythmias are put forward, which provides a reference for the future development and clinical practice of automatic diagnosis of arrhythmias.",

        "abstract": "Taking into account the flexible deployment and line-of-sight (LoS) communication links of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this paper proposes a multi-UAV assisted vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) architecture to provide instantaneous computation support at multiple congestion road segments. Given that the computation resources of a single UAV are insufficient, and offloading tasks directly to the cloud computing center (CCC) in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) introduces significant latency, multiple UAVs with pre-cached service or content caching data are deployed optimally for the vehicle users. In order to address the tradeoff between system costs and service efficiency, we propose a novel cost-efficient layered optimization scheme, in which the number and deployment positions of UAVs are jointly optimized. According to the varying vehicular network environments and the dynamic requirements of vehicle users, we design a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm, combining double deep Q network (DDQN) and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), the former is used to optimize the number of UAVs, and the deployment of UAVs are optimized via the MADDPG. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in lowering total task completed latency and increasing the system profits. The service efficiency in dealing with the vehicle usersâ requirements also be improved.",

        "abstract": "Predicting accurately the mechanisms of drugâdrug interaction (DDI) events is crucial in drug research and development. Existing methods used to predict these events are primarily based on deep learning and have achieved satisfactory results. However, they rarely consider the presence of redundant co-information between the multimodal data of a drug and the need for consistency in the predicted features of each drug modality. Herein, we propose a new method for drug interaction event prediction based on multimodal mutual orthogonal projection and intermodal consistency loss. Our method obtains the features of each modality through a multimodal mutual orthogonal projection module, which eliminates redundant common information with other modalities. In addition, we use the consistency loss between modalities and make the predicted features of each modality more similar. In comparative experiments, our proposed method achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.9500, and an area under the precisionârecall (AUPR) curve is 0.9833 for known DDIs. This method outperforms existing methods. The results show that the proposed method is capable of accurately predicting DDIs. The source code is available at https://github.com/xiaqixiaqi/MOPDDI .",

        "abstract": "Wheat quality and safety are crucial for securing the grain supply. The traditional deep learning methods used in the identification and detection of unsound wheat grains often face challenges, such as complex processing steps, computational complexity, and longer data processing times associated with an increase in the depth of the network. To address these issues, this work introduces the concept of a broad learning system (BLS) to develop a terahertz (THz) image detection model for unsound wheat grains detection. This model is based on a radiologist-inspired deep denoising feature pyramid network BLS (R-F-BLS). The radiologist-inspired deep denoising network (RIDNet) denoising module and feature pyramid network (FPN) feature extraction module are embedded in the BLS network structure. The experimental results show that R-F-BLS achieves 94.68% classification accuracy, marking an improvement of 11.98%, 6.8%, 2.66%, and 2.77% over support vector machine (SVM), simple convolutional neural network (simple CNN), Google Inception Net (GoogleNet), and deep residual neural network (ResNet), respectively. Consequently, the R-F-BLS model combines enhanced accuracy with reduced complexity, positioning it as an effective and innovative approach for unsound wheat grain identification.",

        "abstract": "Complex marine meteorological conditions can lead to errors in shipborne radar measurements. To study these errors and investigate their characteristics, this paper proposes a method for modeling shipborne radar errors under the influence of wind, waves, and currents. First, a coupled wind-wave-current model is established to represent the external environment. Next, we develop a discretized ship motion model and explore the interactions between the environmental forces and ship motion in detail. Then coupling relationships are established among the shipâs six degrees of freedom(6-DOF) to ensure the accuracy of the motion model. Finally, an error model is derived for radar measurements resulting from changes in the shipâs position and orientation, and we use data from the ship motion model to simulate and analyze radar error results under the influence of wind, wave and current.",

        "abstract": "The channel state information (CSI) of malicious users in the field of physical layer security is usually difficult to obtain due to the usersâ passive listening. However, as sensing is integrating into the cellular network, it becomes feasible to acquire the CSI of passive eavesdroppers. Motivated by this, we propose a novel sensing-aided secure communication (SASC) scheme in this paper, which is implemented by a two-stage transmission protocol including beam sensing of the eavesdropperâs CSI and secure communication to the legitimate user against the eavesdropper. In the first stage, the base station (BS) needs to decide the number of sensing beams L , and we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) to establish the relationship between the estimated angle range for the eavesdropperâs location and L , where a larger L for beam sensing returns a tighter CRB to locate the eavesdropper. In the second stage, the BS designs the beamforming vector to transmit confidential data to the legitimate user and avoid leakage to the eavesdropper in the estimated range. As sensing affects the subsequent secure communication, we decouple the non-convex two-stage joint optimization problem into two subproblems and solve it by backward induction. In particular, in the secrecy beamforming subproblem given L , we investigate the worst-case information leakage by constructing a convex hull to approximate the angle range from sensing. Then we develop a semi-closed-form solution of robust secrecy beamforming vector, and use it for the other subproblem to decide initial L . To achieve this goal, we also obtain a semi-closed-form solution of L by considering all potential estimated results in the worst case. Finally, we present simulation results to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SASC scheme as compared to various benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring the security of data outsourced to cloud is a prerequisite for the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in actual production. Secure search based on homomorphic encryption can provide high security and require no expensive setup procedure, which can be applied to resource-limited devices in IoT. However, the existing schemes usually have poor search performance and do not consider multi-owner setting. To solve these issues, we propose an efficient homomorphic encryption-based secure search scheme in multi-owner setting. Specifically, we construct a secure search protocol based on multi-key homomorphic encryption, which can be deployed in multi-owner setting. Meanwhile, we improve the efficiency of our scheme by optimizing the search algorithm. Formal security analysis proves that our scheme is secure against chosen plaintext attack, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme improves the search efficiency by 1000x when compared with state-of-the-art solutions.",

        "abstract": "The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) represents a transformative technological paradigm, seamlessly integrating the digital and physical worlds to enhance and simplify everyday life. In this context, Zero-Trust Federated Learning (ZTFL) further empowers CIoT and spawns a series of emerging applications. However, zero-trust federated learning often encounters bottlenecks in energy consumption and efficiency. The above bottleneck problems hinder the further application and expansion of CIoT, which is not conducive to the healthy development of CIoT. Therefore, this study focuses on the issue of joint optimization of fairness and energy efficiency in ZTFL, particularly in the context of lossy communications. This research explores the fairness problem of ZTFL by Lyapunov optimization in a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system to address these challenges. It proposes a method of dynamic queue quantification of consumer electronics device participation that considers the packet loss rate. Analyzing the objective function, we transform some non-convex functions into convex functions and provide analytical solutions. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluated our model using the MNIST, Cifar10, and Cifar100 datasets, with results showing that, under lossy communications, our proposed model can significantly improve model accuracy while maintaining an average 26% reduction in communication completion.

        "abstract": "Under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning enables systems to cluster data and provide incredibly accurate results. This study explores deep learning for fraud detection, utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Autoencoders to enhance business practices and reduce fraudulent activities in large organizations. For real-time fraud detection, we propose Graph neural network with lambda architecture while for credit card fraud detection, we use an autoencoder, validated through case studies from two banks. The findings demonstrate that these methods effectively detect fraud with balance of precision and recall, improving the efficiency of banking systems. Python is employed for analysis, emphasizing the ability of deep learning to manage and prevent fraud in real-time on dynamic datasets. In the end, this study concludes that by using deep learning algorithms, we can control online credit card fraud detection in banks ,improve the efficiency of the banking system. We can manage fraudulent activity in real-time and on dynamic datasets by utilizing deep learning algorithms, which allows for ongoing improvement of the fraud detection and prevention system.",

        "abstract": "Secure data access control is widely concerned in Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) to protect consumer rights. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is an ideal solution that supports fine-grained access control. It is a pity that they fail to consider the attribute control and the verifiable legitimacy when consumerâs attributes are updated. Additionally, the existing revocable CP-ABE schemes are unsuitable for resource-constrained consumer electronic devices due to their high computational and storage overhead. This paper proposes a blockchain-based access control scheme with attribute update. A new revocation mechanism is designed to guarantee the forward/backward security of the attribute update. The lightweight ciphertext update protocol is proposed to optimize the computation cost. To realize secure and efficient attribute management, this paper designs the on-chain/off-chain separation storage mode, and proposes the traceability-based attribute set generation and validation algorithm. This paper performs the formal security proof. The experimental results demonstrate that the scheme is efficient in terms of encryption and decryption.",

        "abstract": "Decline of driver vigilance is a critical factor of fatal railway accidents. To prevent accidents induced by driver vigilance decline, intervention strategies are needed. The aim of this study is to investigate if cool stimulation intervention (CS-intervention) can be used as a countermeasure for vigilance decline of high-speed railway (HSR) driver. The CS-intervention strategy was tested in an HSR driving simulator with 40 healthy participants with vigilance decline. Each participant completed two monotonous driving tasks: one without stimulation intervention (NO-intervention) and one with 20Â°C cool stimulation intervention (CS-intervention). Self-reported vigilance was assessed by using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and reaction time (RT) was used to estimate the objective vigilance. Eye movement data, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected to investigate the potential arousing effects of CS-intervention. The CS-intervention can effectively awake drivers to reduce their reaction times and KSS. The driverâs percentage of eye closure (PERCLOS) decreased while driving with CS-intervention. The high-frequency part of EEG signals is active, while the permutation entropy (PE) value in the frontal lobe is attenuated. The connectivity between brain lobes is enhanced. The physiological responses also prove the effectiveness of CS-intervention. This study indicate that CS-intervention is an effective strategy to alleviate fatigue and maintain vigilance. Given that CS-intervention can effectively counteract vigilance decline, the findings in this study are expected to provide evidences for the improvement of HSR driving safety.",

        "abstract": "The incidence and mortality rates of malignant tumors, such as acute leukemia, have risen significantly. Clinically, hospitals rely on cytological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears to diagnose malignant tumors, with accurate blood cell counting being crucial. Existing automated methods face challenges such as low feature expression capability, poor interpretability, and redundant feature extraction when processing highdimensional microimage data. We propose a novel finegrained classification model, SCKansformer, for bone marrow blood cells, which addresses these challenges and enhances classification accuracy and efficiency. The model integrates the Kansformer Encoder, SCConv Encoder, and Global-Local Attention Encoder. The Kansformer Encoder replaces the traditional MLP layer with the KAN, improving nonlinear feature representation and interpretability. The SCConv Encoder, with its Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Units, enhances feature representation and reduces redundancy. The Global-Local Attention Encoder combines Multi-head Self-Attention with a Local Part module to capture both global and local features. We validated our model using the Bone Marrow Blood Cell FineGrained Classification Dataset (BMCD-FGCD), comprising over 10,000 samples and nearly 40 classifications, developed with a partner hospital. Comparative experiments on our private dataset, as well as the publicly available PBC and ALL-IDB datasets, demonstrate that SCKansformer outperforms both typical and advanced microcell classification methods across all datasets.",

        "abstract": "In this letter, we propose to employ movable antenna (MA) to enhance covert communications with noise uncertainty, where the confidential data is transmitted from an MA-aided access point (AP) to multiple users with a warden attempting to detect the existence of the legal transmission. To maximize the sum rate of users under covertness constraint, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the transmit beamforming and the positions of MAs at the AP. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we develop a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) based algorithm, where the proximal distance algorithm (PDA) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to optimize the transmit beamforming and the MAsâ positions, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed MAs-aided system can significantly increase the covert sum rate via antenna position optimization as compared to conventional systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs).",

        "abstract": "As a secondary generation method, video recording will cause irreversible damage to the watermark within the video, which has always been challenging in video forensics. Although many video watermarking methods are reported in the literature, these methods, however, still cannot well resist camera recording. This has motivated the authors in this paper to introduce a new video watermarking method to resist camera recording. For the proposed method, two watermarks, i.e., copyright watermark and synchronization watermark, are embedded into the well-selected frequency domain coefficients. The synchronization watermark is used to ensure that the copyright watermark can be successfully extracted at the decoder side. To extract the copyright watermark without manual assistance, a neural network based segmentation model is applied to identify the watermarked video-playing region in the camera-recorded video. Meanwhile, automatic perspective correction is performed on the watermarked video-playing region so that the watermark information can be extracted accurately. The experiments show that the watermark data can be embedded into the raw video successfully and extracted from the camera-recorded video accurately by applying the proposed method. And, the proposed method significantly outperforms related works in terms of robustness in different scenarios, which has verified the superiority and applicability of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we propose a novel detection framework, Multi-head Attention ResNet with Dynamic Bottleneck (DB_RESNET_MHA), to identify physical unsigned road incidents. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a tailored data augmentation strategy to create images that closely mimic the complex variations found in real-world road environments. Second, we enhance model expressiveness by employing attention mechanisms to nonlinearly integrate convolutional kernels within the residual network. Furthermore, we refine the prediction head by applying spatially distinct attention weights, enabling the model to capture intricate correlations between different ...",

        "abstract": "With the advancement in Tiny Machine Learning (ML) technologies, their application in enhancing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for hydraulic engineering surveying and mapping has become increasingly significant. TinyMLâs integration offers a leap in processing efficiency and capabilities, particularly in addressing challenges such as UAV search and monitoring due to loss of contact or forced landings. The usage of medical cyber-physical systems in healthcare can revolutionize existing service delivery methods. The study focuses into the spatial grid mapping technique for three-dimensional information, the PTZ camera spatial grid target locking algorithm, and the UAV detection and image correction algorithm. The UAV target is processed using the surveying UAV target tracking method. TinyML techniques are essential for processing and analyzing these photos quickly. Precise UAV identification and tracking are made possible by the combination of image recognition and radar data, which are then processed using TinyML algorithms. This study explores the complexities of algorithms designed specifically for TinyML, such as tracking, UAV detection, grid mapping, and 3D grid space division. Experimental results validate the enhanced capability of this. The results show how well the proposed technique maps and surveys water conservation regions while promptly catching, locking onto, and tracking drones. The algorithm in this study betters than the YOLO, SSD, and RetinaNet algorithms in the recognition and detection of image-oriented surveying and mapping drones.",

        "abstract": "Software defect prediction (SDP) plays a pivotal role in ensuring high-quality software development by aiding in the early identification of potential defects. This practice has gained substantial attention in the field of software engineering over the years. Recent advancements in deep learning have primarily focused on extracting general syntactic features from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for SDP. However, AST-based neural network models might overlook important structural information related to control flows embedded within the source code. Given that software defects are often influenced by control flow patterns, this article proposes a novel SDP approach called control flow graph and graph attention (CFG2AT) network-based SDP. CFG2AT is specifically designed to automatically identify software defects and contains a graph-structured attention unit to effectively capture control flow information. To evaluate the effectiveness of CFG2AT, we carried out extensive experiments using data from 15 versions of six different open-source software projects under both within-project and cross-project defect prediction settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CFG2AT approach generally outperforms a range of competing methods for defect prediction. The improvement is 7.09%â12.80% in F1 , 1.30%â4.15% in area under curve (AUC), and 6.78%â17.54% in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) under within-project defect prediction, and 23.76%â44.79% in F1 , 8.93%â13.27% in AUC, and 36.92%â94.89% in MCC under CPDP, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and brain-computer interface (BCI) research, there has been increasing attention towards emotion recognition techniques based on electro encephalogram (EEG) recently. The complexity of EEG data poses a challenge when it comes to accurately classifying emotions by integrating time, frequency, and spatial domain features. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fusion model called DC-ASTGCN, which combines the strengths of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and adaptive spatiotemporal graphic convolutional neural network (ASTGCN) to comprehensively analyze and understand EEG signals. The DCNN focuses on extracting frequency-domain and local spatial features from EEG signals to identify brain region activity patterns, while the ASTGCN, with its spatiotemporal attention mechanism and adaptive brain topology layer, reveals the functional connectivity features between brain regions in different emotional states. This integration significantly enhances the model's ability to understand and recognize emotional states. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP and SEED datasets demonstrate that the DC-ASTGCN model outperforms existing state-of the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, deploying them brings significant challenges due to the huge cost of memory, energy, and computation. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various model compression techniques such as model quantization and model pruning. Recently, there has been a surge in research on compression methods to achieve model efficiency while retaining performance. Furthermore, more and more works focus on customizing the DNN hardware accelerators to better leverage the model compression techniques. In addition to efficiency, preserving security and privacy is critical for deploying DNNs. However, the vast and diverse body of related works can be overwhelming. This inspires us to conduct a comprehensive survey on recent research toward the goal of high-performance, cost-efficient, and safe deployment of DNNs. Our survey first covers the mainstream model compression techniques, such as model quantization, model pruning, knowledge distillation, and optimizations of nonlinear operations. We then introduce recent advances in designing hardware accelerators that can adapt to efficient model compression approaches. In addition, we discuss how homomorphic encryption can be integrated to secure DNN deployment. Finally, we discuss several issues, such as hardware evaluation, generalization, and integration of various compression approaches. Overall, we aim to provide a big picture of efficient DNNs from algorithm to hardware accelerators and security perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized deep learning has made significant success since it avoids the single point of failure in centralized solutions. However, the system might deviate from the correct model due to Byzantine attacks. Existing Byzantine-resilient defense models are mainly of a one-step evaluation fashion, making them vulnerable to rigorous topology and sophisticated cyber-attacks due to lack of historical evaluations. This paper proposes a credibility assessment based parameter aggregation rule (CA-PAR) that evaluates each neighboring node by its long-term performance. For each node and its neighbors, two concepts, immediate reward and history information based credibility are firstly proposed to describe the immediate reliability at current iteration and the comprehensive assessment of the reliability respectively. Thereafter, all the received parameters are aggregated in linear combination, in which the adjacent weight is determined by credibility value. Finally, the influences of suspicious nodes can gradually be reduced and eliminated. Experimental results in MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate the algorithmâs tolerance for five state-of-the-art attack methods against an arbitrary number of faulty nodes. Compared with the previous defense models, the proposed algorithm in this paper outperforms in topology constraints, training accuracy and computation cost.",

This, however, has also presented new challenges, such as the need to understand and model the interactions of traffic participants, including their competition and cooperation behaviors. Game theory has been widely adopted to study rationally selfish or cooperative behaviors during interactions and has been applied to advanced intersection management. In this paper, we review the application of game theory to intersection management and sort out relevant studies under various levels of intelligence and connectivity. First, the problem of urban intersection management and its challenges are briefly introduced. The basic elements of game theory specifically for intersection applications are then summarized. Next, we present the game-theoretic models and solutions that have been applied to intersection management. Finally, the limitations and potential opportunities for subsequent studies within the game-theoretic application to intersection management are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Protein structure prediction (PSP) is an important scientific problem because it helps humans to understand how proteins perform their biological functions. This paper models the PSP problem as a multi-objective optimization problem with three fast and accurate knowledge-based energy functions. This way, using evolutionary computation (EC)-based artificial intelligence (AI) approach to solve this multi-objective PSP problem to find the optimal structure is explainable. Considering that the multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework shows efficient performance in solving lots of multi-objective benchmarks and real-world problems, this paper proposes a new AI approach named improved MPMO-based differential evolution (IMPMO-DE) to solve the multi-objective PSP problem. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that MPMO is applied to PSP, with three novel strategies. First, an adaptive archive-based mutation strategy is proposed to better balance the exploration and exploitation abilities by adaptively using different archive-based mutation operators in different evolutionary stages. Second, a mixed individual transfer strategy is proposed to share search information among the multiple populations to accelerate the convergence speed. Third, an evolvable archive update strategy is proposed to generate more promising solutions through evolving the archived solutions. IMPMO-DE is tested on 28 representative proteins and all the available template-free modeling proteins up to 404 residues in the famous Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) competition. Experimental results show that IMPMO-DE performs better than the compared state-of-the-art EC-based PSP methods and ranks above average compared with all the CASP14 competitors. More importantly, IMPMO-DE is a new efficient AI approach that opens a promising optimization-based evolutionary and explainable way for efficient PSP rather than deep learning approaches like AlphaFold2,...",

        "abstract": "Matrix-variable optimization is a generalization of vector-variable optimization and has been found to have many important applications. To reduce computation time and storage requirement, this article presents two matrix-form recurrent neural networks (RNNs), one continuous-time model and another discrete-time model, for solving matrix-variable optimization problems with linear constraints. The two proposed matrix-form RNNs have low complexity and are suitable for parallel implementation in terms of matrix state space. The proposed continuous-time matrix-form RNN can significantly generalize existing continuous-time vector-form RNN. The proposed discrete-time matrix-form RNN can be effectively used in blind image restoration, where the storage requirement and computational cost are largely reduced. Theoretically, the two proposed matrix-form RNNs are guaranteed to be globally convergent to the optimal solution under mild conditions. Computed results show that the proposed matrix-form RNN-based algorithm is superior to related vector-form RNN and matrix-form RNN-based algorithms, in terms of computation time.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the issue of limited information based emergency response control for a specific category of underwater cyber-physical systems (UCPSs) confronted with multiple emergencies. The focus is on a typical underwater vehicle system (UVS), whose communication with the control center may be compromised by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The occurrence of dual DoS attacks leads to significant information loss, intensifying the complexity of decision-making and emergency response during critical situations. Moreover, abrupt ocean current disturbances or faults will also seriously affect the performance of UVSs. Drawing upon distinct DoS attack scenarios, this study introduces a novel emergency response decision mechanism. A limited information-based disturbance observer (DO) is then proposed to effectively handle various unknown disturbances, ensuring favorable disturbance estimation performance. Subsequently, as for different attack channels, two innovative emergency response controllers are respectively proposed, considering the constraints of limited information. Furthermore, distinct stability criteria are derived by using Lyapunov stability and stochastic analysis techniques to guarantee the stabilization of UVSs. Finally, a series of numerical results is presented to illstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm under various emergency scenarios. Note to Practitioners âThis study presents an novel framework for emergency automatic control and decision-making in UVSs suffering from different emergencies. While most of previous research primarily concentrated on emergency situations in the physical layer, this article delves into both the information layer and the physical layer to tackle decision-making and response challenges within information-constrained environments. Specifically, a limited information-based DO is designed to dynamically model disturbances, such as ocean currents and actuator faults. The DO adapts its structure based on va...",

        "abstract": "This research delves into the design of collaborative beamforming for millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications, which takes advantage of double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for enhanced signal transmission. The core objective is to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the base station and the phase shifts of the RISs to achieve the highest possible sum rate. To derive an efficient solution, the original problem is recast using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach, paving the way for an equivalent problem formulation. An effective alternating optimization strategy is introduced to tackle this problem, sequentially adjusting the transmit beamforming matrix and the RIS phase shifts for near-optimal results. In particular, a specialized WMMSE-based algorithm is devised for designing the transmit beamforming, while the passive beamforming of the RIS is optimized through semi-definite relaxation and majorization-minimization techniques. This balance ensures both high system performance and manageable computational load. Further analysis delves into the convergence properties and computational demands of the proposed methods. Simulation results are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the enhanced spectral efficiency achieved through the utilization of the double-RIS.",

        "abstract": "Open-vocabulary video instance segmentation strives to segment and track instances belonging to an open set of categories in a videos. The vision-language model Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown robust zero-shot classification ability in image-level open-vocabulary tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder network, called CLIP-VIS, to adapt CLIP for open-vocabulary video instance segmentation. Our CLIP-VIS adopts frozen CLIP and introduces three modules, including class-agnostic mask generation, temporal top K -enhanced matching, and weighted open-vocabulary classification. Given a set of initial queries, class-agnostic mask generation introduces a pixel decoder and a transformer decoder on CLIP pre-trained image encoder to predict query masks and corresponding object scores and mask IoU scores. Then, temporal top K -enhanced matching performs query matching across frames using the K mostly matched frames. Finally, weighted open-vocabulary classification first employs mask pooling to generate query visual features from CLIP pre-trained image encoder, and second performs weighted classification using object scores and mask IoU scores. Our CLIP-VIS does not require the annotations of instance categories and identities. The experiments are performed on various video instance segmentation datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, especially for novel categories. When using ConvNeXt-B as backbone, our CLIP-VIS achieves the AP and APn scores of 32.2% and 40.2% on the validation set of LV-VIS dataset, which outperforms OV2Seg by 11.1% and 23.9% respectively. We will release the source code and models at https://github.com/zwq456/CLIP-VIS.git.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel image enhancement method, called the all-inclusive image enhancement (AIIE), is proposed that can effectively enhance the degraded images for improving the visibility of image content. These imageries were acquired under various types of weather conditions such as haze, low-light, underwater, and sandstorm, etc. One commonality shared by this class of noise is that the resulted degradations on visual quality or visibility are caused by low-frequency interference. Existing image enhancement methods lack the ability to deal with all types of degradations from this class, while our proposed AIIE offers a unified treatment for them. To achieve this goal, a statistical property is obtained from the study of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of 1,000 high- and 1000 low-quality images on their DCT domains. It shows that the normalized DCT coefficients (between 0 and 1) of high-quality images has about 95% fall in the interval [0, 0.2]; for low-quality images, almost all the coefficients are in the same interval. This fundamental property, called the DCT prior (DCT-P), is instrumental to the development of our AIIE algorithm proposed in this paper. Since the proposed DCT-P delineates the attributes of high- and low-quality images clearly, it becomes a highly effective tool to convert low-quality images to its enhanced version. Extensive experimental results have clearly validated the superior performance of the AIIE conducted on different types of deteriorated images in terms of visual quality and efficiency as well as significant advantages on computational complexity, which is essential for real-time applications.",

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature in LLM-enhanced RL and summarize its characteristics compared with conventional RL methods, aiming to clarify the research scope and directions for future studies. Utilizing the classical agentâenvironment interaction paradigm, we propose a structured taxonomy to systematically categorize LLMsâ functionalities in RL, including four roles: information processor, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. For each role, we summarize the methodologies, analyze the specific RL challenges that are mitigated and provide insights into future directions. Finally, the comparative analysis of each role, potential applications, prospective opportunities, and challenges of the LLM-enhanced RL are discussed. By proposing this taxonomy, we aim to provide a framework for researchers to effectively leverage LLMs in the RL field, potentially accelerating RL applications in complex applications, such as robotics, autonomous driving, and energy systems.",

        "abstract": "With the expanding use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in a variety of applications, their safety has become a critical concern. UAVs are confronted with a variety of unforeseen circumstances during missions; in these instances, the UAVs need to autonomously locate a suitable landing site, plan flight routes, and avoid obstacles in unstructured environments. Due to the limitations of computing power and sensors, it is challenging to attain the goal. The aim of research study is to investigate the monocular emergency autonomous landing algorithm. This work concentrates specifically on extracting depth and vision information. A topology information extractor is designed to transform images into graphs and assess the connectivity of terrain. In addition, a depth information extractor is designed to compute the slope and roughness of the ground. A $3$ D topology optimizer is designed to optimize the graph based on depth information and evaluate the landing suitability using a heuristic strategy. For action decision making, a 3D topology decision method based on Depth-Enhanced Graph Structure (DEGS) is proposed. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of DEGS, this study constructed a simulated scenario based on an actual scene. The results of the experiment indicate that DEGS outperforms its counterparts in terms of the accuracy of action prediction and landing success rate. Note to Practitioners âUsing DEGS, this study proposes a novel method for emergency UAV landing on unknown fields. The proposed method is founded on the following fundamental concepts: First, the UAV first generates a DEGS of the unknown field. Second, the UAV then evaluates the landing risk and guides the UAVs in planning a safe landing trajectory. Third, the UAV implements the landing trajectory and lands safely on the unknown field using monocular aerial vision. Frame Sequential and Self-supervision Network (FSSN), a multi-scale vision-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) network, is propos...",

        "abstract": "As the most common complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the main causes of irreversible blindness. Automatic DR grading plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and intervention, reducing the risk of vision loss in people with diabetes. In these years, various deep-learning approaches for DR grading have been proposed. Most previous DR grading models are trained using the dataset of single-field fundus images, but the entire retina cannot be fully visualized in a single field of view. There are also problems of scattered location and great differences in the appearance of lesions in fundus images. To address the limitations caused by incomplete fundus features, and the difficulty in obtaining lesion information. This work introduces a novel multi-view DR grading framework, which solves the problem of incomplete fundus features by jointly learning fundus images from multiple fields of view. Furthermore, the proposed model combines multi-view inputs such as fundus images and lesion snapshots. It utilizes heterogeneous convolution blocks (HCB) and scalable self-attention classes (SSAC), which enhance the ability of the model to obtain lesion information. The experimental results show that our proposed method performs better than the benchmark methods on the large-scale dataset.",

        "abstract": "A large number of 3D spectral descriptors have been proposed in the literature, which act as an essential component for 3D deformable shape matching and related applications. An outstanding descriptor should have desirable natures including high-level descriptive capacity, cheap storage, and robustness to a set of nuisances. It is, however, unclear which descriptors are more suitable for a particular application. This paper fills the gap by comprehensively evaluating nine state-of-the-art spectral descriptors on ten popular deformable shape datasets as well as perturbations such as mesh discretization, geometric noise, scale transformation, non-isometric setting, partiality, and topological noise. Our evaluated terms for a spectral descriptor cover four major concerns, i.e., distinctiveness, robustness, compactness, and computational efficiency. In the end, we present a summary of the overall performance and several interesting findings that can serve as guidance for the following researchers to construct a new spectral descriptor and choose an appropriate spectral feature in a particular application.",

        "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides a new approach to satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive applications by trading communicational capability for computational capability. Besides seeking for additional physical resources for improving performance, such as Device-to-Device (D2D) paradigm and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), with Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), information forecast brings a new dimension to unleash the potential of MEC. However, most existing literature does not tailor information forecast algorithm to the MEC context, which diminishes the utility of the forecast information. In this work, we propose a framework for adaptive task offloading based on channel forecast for MEC system. Specifically, we first propose an online resource allocation algorithm with forecast information through Lyapunov optimization. Then, the performance in terms of delay and power consumption is analyzed in closed-form, based on which critical insight towards the requirements on forecast algorithm is obtained. Next, based on Sparse Gaussian Process and Linear Model of Coregionalization (SGP-LMC), we propose a channel forecast algorithm to find a desired trade-off between forecast accuracy and model complexity in terms of maximizing the utility of forecast information. Finally, simulation is performed to verify the performance improvements.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the biological perception has been a powerful tool for handling the camouflaged object detection (COD) task. However, most existing methods are heavily dependent on the local spatial information of diverse scales from convolutional operations to optimize initial features. A commonly neglected point in these methods is the long-range dependencies between feature pixels from different scale spaces that can help the model build a global structure of the object, inducing a more precise image representation. In this article, we propose a novel globalâlocal collaborative optimization network called GLCONet. Technically, we first design a collaborative optimization strategy (COS) from the perspective of multisource perception to simultaneously model the local details and global long-range relationships, which can provide features with abundant discriminative information to boost the accuracy in detecting camouflaged objects. Furthermore, we introduce an adjacent reverse decoder (ARD) that contains cross-layer aggregation and reverse optimization to integrate complementary information from different levels for generating high-quality representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GLCONet method with different backbones can effectively activate potentially significant pixels in an image, outperforming 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public COD datasets.

        "abstract": "The notched continuum robot (NCR), characterized by its compact size and excellent mechanical properties, is extensively used in the design of minimally invasive surgical robots. However, integrating sensors into the NCR in a limited surgical environment is challenging. Using drive state for force estimation is a promising method that relies on the accurate modeling of the NCR. This article proposes a sensor-free force estimation method for the NCR. The method establishes an accurate static model of the NCR based on the beam constraint model (BCM). Subsequently, cable length changes are introduced as constraints into the static model, enabling sensor-free force estimation. The proposed static model demonstrates good accuracy, with results from 28 experiments showing an average position error of 1.23 mm, accounting for 2.48% of the robot's total length. Based on the accurate static model, the average estimation error of the proposed force estimation method is 7.41 mN. Compared to models using traditional assumptions, the proposed force estimation method in this article also demonstrates a significant improvement.",

        "abstract": "Feature selection (FS) is a very important technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, as successfully selecting informative features can significantly increase the learning performance while reducing the computational cost. However, most of the existing FS methods tend to treat the HSI as a whole for FS, which does not fully consider the unique characteristics of HSIs and disregards the fact that different feature classes possess varying preferences for features. Thus, this paper proposes a superpixel segmentation based evolutionary multitasking algorithm for FS of HSIs, called SS-EMT. First, the superpixel segmentation method is used to partition the original HSI into several superpixel blocks, which can preserve well the information of different classes of the original image. Second, in order to explore each superpixel block efficiently, an evolutionary multitasking algorithm using particle swarm optimization is designed, which treats each superpixel block as a subtask and then optimizes these subtasks collaboratively by transferring useful knowledge among related subtasks. In addition, a new individual evaluation mechanism is devised to obtain multiple high-quality feature subsets with different numbers of features simultaneously in a single run, thus reducing the computational cost. Finally, extensive experimental results on four common HSI datasets under three classifiers validate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art FS methods.",

        "abstract": "Generative text-to-image models, which allow users to create appealing images through a text prompt, have seen a dramatic increase in popularity in recent years. However, most users have a limited understanding of how such models work and often rely on trial and error strategies to achieve satisfactory results. The prompt history contains a wealth of information that could provide users with insights into what has been explored and how the prompt changes impact the output image, yet little research attention has been paid to the visual analysis of such process to support users. We propose the Image Variant Graph, a novel visual representation designed to support comparing prompt-image pairs and exploring the editing history. The Image Variant Graph models prompt differences as edges between corresponding images and presents the distances between images through projection. Based on the graph, we developed the PrompTHis system through co-design with artists. Based on the review and analysis of the prompting history, users can better understand the impact of prompt changes and have a more effective control of image generation. A quantitative user study and qualitative interviews demonstrate that PrompTHis can help users review the prompt history, make sense of the model, and plan their creative process.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-based localization technology has become increasingly popular due to its exceptional maneuverability, versatile coverage capabilities, and reliable line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity. However, the accuracy improvement by exploiting UAVs' placement poses a new challenge on multi-UAV localization system. This paper investigates the placement optimization problem for a multi-UAV localization network, where each UAV is equipped with a uniform circular array (UCA) to locate the target by adopting the angle-ofarrival (AOA) measurement. To measure the accuracy of the UCA-based localization system, we characterize the measurement error to be dependent on target-to-UAV distance and present a comprehensive derivation of the Cramer-Rao lower bound Â´ (CRLB). Next, we formulate the problem as a non-convex semi-infinite optimization, aiming to minimize the worst-case squared position error bound (SPEB) by designing the robust placement strategy under some stringent geometric position constraints. We address this problem by alternatively solving two sub-problems, corresponding to a slave problem for calculating the worstcase SPEB of the uncertainty region under a fixed deployment of UAVs, as well as a master problem for optimizing UAVs' placement. By virtue of the particular problem structure, we develop the gradient projection-based method for the slave problem. Meanwhile, considering the lack of a closed expression for the maximum SPEB concerning UAVs' deployment in the master problem, we devise an iterative algorithm to acquire an efficient solution with the aid of Gibbs Sampling approach. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Hypervolume subset selection (HSS) has received significant attention since it has a strong connection with evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), such as environment selection and post-processing to identify representative solutions for decision-makers. The goal of HSS is to find the optimal subset that maximizes the hypervolume indicator subject to a given cardinality constraint. However, existing HSS algorithms or related methods are not efficient in achieving good performance in high-dimensional objective spaces. This is primarily because HSS problems become NP-hard when the number of objectives exceeds two, and the calculation of hypervolume contribution is very time-consuming. To efficiently solve HSS problems while maintaining a good solution quality, we propose a fast and scalable hypervolume subset selection method for many-objective optimization based on the determinantal point process (DPP), named DPP-HSS, which is fully free of hypervolume contribution calculation. Specifically, DPP-HSS constructs a hypervolume kernel matrix by extracting the convergence and diversity representations of each solution for a given HSS problem. This matrix is then used to build a DPP model. Subsequently, the original HSS problem is reformulated as a new maximization optimization problem based on the constructed model. A greedy DPP-based hypervolume subset selection algorithm is implemented to solve this transformed problem. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DPP-HSS achieves significant speedup and good hypervolume performance in comparison with state-of-the-art HSS algorithms on benchmark problems. Furthermore, DPP-HSS demonstrates very good scalability with respect to the number of objectives.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a highly sensitive wireless passive flexible pressure sensor. The sensor employs an ionic film as the dielectric layer, utilizes a spiral coil as the antenna for transmitting and receiving signals of the sensor, and adopts a sandwich process to complete the fabrication of the sensor. This study validates through circuit analysis and simulation that the sensor can be used for wireless passive detection of pressure information. Firstly, the performance of the ionic film is examined. The sensor fabricated with the ionic film has high sensitivity (38.74 N -1 ), fast response time (100 ms), and high stability. This study also tests the wireless transmission performance between the sensor and the antenna. The test results indicate that the sensor can achieve wireless signal detection within a range of 13 mm. The pressure sensitivity of the sensor in the range of 0 - 0.5 N is 394.94 MHz/N. When the applied pressure increases from 0.5 N to 10 N, the resonant frequency of the sensor decreases from 210 MHz to 160 MHz, and the pressure sensitivity is 4.15 MHz/N. The sensor can realize palm bending detection, breathing, and voice recognition, and has extensive application prospects in the fields of human-computer interaction and wearables.",

        "abstract": "The escalation of antibiotic resistance underscores the need for innovative approaches to combat bacterial infections. Phage therapy has emerged as a promising solution, wherein host determination plays an important role. Phage lysins, characterized by their specificity in targeting and cleaving corresponding host bacteria, serve as key players in this paradigm. In this study, we present a novel approach by leveraging genes of phage-encoded lytic enzymes for host prediction, culminating in the development of LHPre. Initially, gene fragments of phage-encoded lytic enzymes and their respective hosts were collected from the database. Secondly, DNA sequences were encoded using the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) method, and pseudo samples were generated employing the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to address class imbalance. Finally, a prediction model was constructed using the Vision Transformer(Vit) model. Five-fold cross-validation results demonstrated that LHPre surpassed other state-of-the-art phage host prediction methods, achieving accuracies of 85.04%, 90.01%, and 93.39% at the species, genus, and family levels, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Piecewise linear neural networks (PLNNs) are proven universal approximators for continuous functions on the compact domain. For multiple PLNNs (mPLNNs) differing from each other in suffering different approximation errors (AEs) when approximating the same continuous function, activating all the PLNNs to approximate the continuous function, and then, picking up the minimum AE (MAE) from all the AEs seems to be a practical way to arrive at such MAE. Activating PLNNs has to consume energy, and more activated PLNNs provide more AEs to consider, which can maximize the probability of guaranteeing the MAE, while also needing to harvest more energy. Therefore, how to make the optimal tradeoff between energy harvested and approximation accuracy for mPLNNs arises as an interesting issue. To address this problem, this paper first deduces the objective function, with the accumulative probability of obtaining the MAE as the objective and the accumulative energy harvested as the constraint, then reveals the optimal probability that each hidden neuron (HN) in the activated PLNN should be activated, and finally uncovers the optimal activation probability for each PLNN. An algorithm based on our discovered theoretical results is proposed for mPLNNs to enjoy the maximum probability of achieving the MAE at the acceptable level of accumulative energy harvested. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify its performance. Note to Practitioners âThis paper addresses the interesting issue of how to make mPLNNs approximate the continuous function with the highest approximation accuracy under the energy constraint. Through the insightful discovery of the optimal activation probability for each HN in the activated PLNN as well as the optimal activation probability for each PLNN, this paper facilitates mPLNNs to suffer the MAE in their approximations to continuous functions, with the maximum probability while maintaining the energy harvested within a given range. Because PLNNs can model the ...",

        "abstract": "Communication base stations can achieve high-precision tracking and accurate classification for multiple extended targets in the context of integrated communication and sensing by transmitting wideband signal. However, the time resources of the base stations are often limited. In the time-division operation mode, part of the time resources must be reserved to guarantee communication performance, while the rest of the resources must be properly allocated for better multi-target sensing performance. To deal with this, we develop a sensing task-oriented resource allocation (RA) scheme for wideband sensors. We first derive the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound for the estimation errors of position and shape parameters of the extended targets, and analyze their inside relations w.r.t. the resource vectors. Based on this, we construct the evaluation metric of tracking and classification performance, and subsequently build a non-smooth mathematical resource optimization model to maximize the target capacity within predetermined tracking and classification requirements. To solve this RA model, we then design an efficient two-step solution technique that incorporates dual transformation and discrete search. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RA scheme can greatly increase the number of the well sensed targets within a limited sensing resource budget.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the secure distributed model predictive control (SDMPC) challenge for the heterogeneous UAV-UGV formation system under malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, utilizing a nonlinear discrete-time model to represent system dynamics. It examines the scenario where DoS attacks obstruct communication between neighboring agents. A novel neighbor output prediction strategy is introduced to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks. Upon detecting a DoS attack, subsystems affected by the compromised channel predict the output sequences of their upstream counterparts, updating these predictions at each time step based on receiver buffer contents and attack duration. Subsequently, a cost function incorporating the predicted output sequences and a terminal constraint tailored to DoS conditions is formulated to maintain system stability during attacks. The analysis thoroughly explores recursive feasibility and input-to-state practical stability (ISpS). Comparative tests underscore the proposed SDMPC algorithm's effectiveness and enhanced security in maintaining stability amid DoS attacks.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative authentication, boasting enhanced accuracy, robust resilience, and optimized efficiency, holds immense promise for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, existing collaborative authentication methods overlook both the credibility evaluation and incentives of participating nodes, thereby compromising authentication accuracy and resulting in failures. Furthermore, reliance on trusted decision-fusion institution introduces vulnerabilities and single points of failure. To address these issues, we design a credibility-weighted soft authentication approach specifically for UAV networks, thereby enhancing accuracy by effectively integrating the trustworthiness of collaborating nodes. To further encourage active participation from nodes, we introduce an incentive-based reputation system. Finally, based on the above approaches, we propose a distributed authentication method by leveraging blockchain technology and optimization theory that not only emphasizes security but also optimizes resource selection in UAV networks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates our schemeâs distributed authentication with minimized resource consumption under specified security strength, mitigating single points of failure and fulfilling efficient mutual authentication requirements. Experimental results show a remarkable 78.45% increase in authentication accuracy and a 44.51% reduction in resource consumption compared to advanced solution.",

        "abstract": "In the field of InfraredâVisible Image Fusion (IVIF), the preservation of details, edges, and texture is crucial for generating high-quality fused images. However, a major challenge arises due to the inevitable loss of high-frequency information during feature extraction, resulting in fused images that lack significant details. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch auto-encoder by exploiting an invertible high-frequency branch for detailed feature preservation and a transformer-based low-frequency branch for global dependencies modeling. First, the high-frequency branch employs the wavelet transforms and an Invertible Neural Networks (INN)-based encoder to model high-frequency features through an invertible transformation, including a forward process for image fusion and an inverse process for original image reconstruction. Additionally, a high-frequency loss is designed to enhance the high-frequency feature representation for high-quality image fusion. Second, a low-frequency branch based on a transformer encoder and an adaptive fusion module is introduced to capture the global contextual features of the infrared and visible images. Finally, the decoder integrates the low- and high-frequency features from both branches to generate the final fused image. Image fusion, object detection, and semantic segmentation experiments conducted on public datasets such as TNO, MFNet, and M 3 FD, show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion methods.",

        "abstract": "Voxel-based 3D object detection has been widely applied in robotics, virtual reality, and autonomous driving. However, inefficiency in the voxelization and backbone-network computation, which are the main components of voxel-based models, prevents efficient 3D object detection. First, due to the high sparsity and irregularity of the point cloud, the voxelization process usually requires generalized platforms, such as CPUs, and causes low voxelization speed. Second, the voxel-based models contain considerable transposed convolutional layers, and existing accelerators introduce considerable additional hardware to support both convolution and transposed convolution operations. Nonetheless, this strategy incurs significant hardware costs. Besides, transposed convolutions result in various patterns of sparse feature maps, and pruning, as a representative model compression technique, results in sparse weight matrices. The two types of sparsity impose challenges in accelerating the voxel-based models, including activation-weight matching efficiency, low partial-sum accumulation efficiency, and workload imbalance issues. In this work, we propose DSAV, a 3D object detection accelerator to address these obstacles. Specifically, we first propose a hash-based voxelizer for efficient voxelization, by storing and indexing voxels hierarchically. Then, we collaboratively design the transposed convolution acceleration method, structured pruning method, and accelerator architecture for the voxel-based models. As a result, the accelerator can fully leverage the sparsity lies in both feature maps and weight matrices. Experimental results show that the proposed accelerator can outperform prior studies by 19Ã ~ 19.8Ã faster in voxelization, and 4.29Ã ~38.01Ã faster in backbone inference. Finally, the accelerator achieves 4.61Ã ~ 31.63Ã speedups than its counterparts in 3D object detection tasks.",

        "abstract": "As a renewable and green energy source, wind energy has attracted great attention from academia and industry in recent decades. However, it is challenging to integrate wind energy into smart grids due to the instability and randomness of wind speed. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a clustering-based short-term wind speed interval prediction with multi-objective ensemble learning, which can provide an accurate and reliable wind speed interval prediction to support energy dispatch planning. First, a clustering-based uncertainties estimation method segments the initial wind sequence into several groups and determines the estimated width for each group. Second, a variational mode decomposition is employed to acquire the sub-sequence matrix of wind speed, and then a Hurst exponent-based model selection method is used to choose and train an optimal model for each sub-sequence based on its long-term correlation. Finally, an improved multi-objective optimizer is utilized to determine the optimal superposition weights of the prediction results for each model. The proposed approach is evaluated using eight cases from two wind farms, which are published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art studies, demonstrating a higher prediction interval coverage probability and a narrower prediction interval width.",

        "abstract": "Considering that the nature of the stego signal caused by spatial domain steganography and joint photographic experts group (JPEG) domain steganography is different, existing deep-learning steganalysis networks typically cannot work well in both spatial and JPEG domains. We propose a unified steganalysis network named ESNet to effectively preserve and identify the stego signal from spatial and JPEG domains. Specifically, dual-branch preprocessing extracts noise residuals by using fixed SRM kernels (branch 1) and randomly initialized kernels (branch 2), fuses the features from two branches and exchanges the fused complementary information through two carefully designed bidirectional fusion blocks, thereby effectively enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. During feature extraction, considering that low-level features, such as texture and edge, are indispensable for steganalysis, we gather multi-level feature maps at different layers of the network to provide richer feature representations and merge them by using a multi-level feature fusion module, which learns the weight of different features in single-level feature map to enhance the expression of steganographic features. During classification, the multi-scale attention pooling module is employed to extract multi-scale features by designing convolution kernels of different sizes. After concatenating features of different scales, gated channel transformation is exploited to weight the importance of each channel to further strengthen the representations of steganographic features. Finally, stylepooling in combination with global standard deviation pooling and global average pooling, is used to compress channels and preserve the representation ability of channels as much as possible for classification. The experimental results show that the proposed ESNet exhibits state-of-the-art detection performance in both spatial and JPEG domains, and achieves satisfactory robustness against the cover source mismatch.",

        "abstract": "Disseminating continuous packet flows injected at multiple location-random source nodes to all network nodes, known as the multi-source dynamic global broadcast problem, is a fundamental building block for wireless multi-hop networks to run smoothly and efficiently. Previous studies on dynamic global broadcast all assume reliable communications. However, in realistic wireless networks, there exist unpredictable transmission failures caused by the randomized signal interference from uncorrelated wireless networks sharing the same spectrum or even malicious attackers. In this paper, by integrating the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model, multi-channel communication mode, and randomized malicious channel jamming controlled by an adaptive adversary, we present an SINR-based adversarial channel jamming model to capture the unpredictable transmission failures in a wireless multi-hop network. We first propose a distributed Jamming-resilient Multi-source Static Broadcast (JMSB) algorithm based on random channel selection and message transmissions for multi-hop wireless networks under the above SINR-based adversarial channel jamming model. We then propose a distributed stable Jamming-resilient Multi-source Dynamic Broadcast (JMDB) algorithm which iterates JMSB repeatedly and efficiently in a two-stage manner. We derive the maximum supportable broadcast throughput of JMDB under the stability guarantee, i.e., the expected boundedness on the queue length of each network node and expected broadcast latency for each injected packet. Simulation results shows the stability and throughput efficiency of our proposed JMDB algorithm.",

        "abstract": "For permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), the machine model is critical to predict the operating states for motor control, which, however, can be greatly affected by system nonlinearities. Hence, this paper investigates accurate machine modeling for control and parameter estimation. In the proposed approach, the PMSM model with saturated inductances is used as the base model, and this paper investigates modeling and compensation of the offsets to the base model due to system nonlinearities such as saturation and core loss effects for accurate machine modeling and voltage prediction. Specifically, the offsets to the base model are modeled using nonlinear functions with variable coefficients to compensate saturation and core loss effect, which can achieve better accuracy without changing the model structure. A differential estimation model is derived to estimate the model coefficients from a small amount of measurements with simplified procedure. Moreover, the model offset calculation is both computation and memory efficient with simplified implementation. The contribution is to improve the machine model accuracy and achieve precise voltage prediction for practical applications. Experiments, comparisons and the application to temperature estimation are conducted on a test interior PMSM to validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Drug combination therapy plays a vital role in disease treatment, including cancer, as it contributes to treatment efficacy and can alleviate the effect of drug resistance. Although clinical trials and screening may provide valuable information about synergistic drug combinations, they suffer from challenging combinatorial space. Multiple methods are proposed to address those issues. However, they still fail in making full use of global and local triplet context relationships of known synergistic combinations. To this end, a deep learning model which leverages dual view hypergraph representation fusion for synergistic drug combinations identification is proposed, namely DVHSyn. It first extracts the transcriptome features of cancer cell lines and molecular structures of drugs. Subsequently, by modeling the synergistic effect on a hypergraph, DVHSyn simultaneously learns the local and global context of the sample triplets via a hypergraph view and its expanded heterogeneous graph view. Finally, the learned representations of the above two branches are fused selectively to predict synergistic drug combinations. Experiment results demonstrate that DVHSyn surpasses six other competing methods. One case study also reflects that DVHSyn has the potential to predict novel synergistic drug combinations. Overall, our method is effective in identifying synergistic drug combinations and provides new insights for novel drug development.",

        "abstract": "Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, yet remains challenging in educational settings due to the presence of objects of various sizes. Subpar detection can significantly impede subsequent tasks' performance. To address this, we present a novel framework, Small Object Detection Super Resolution (SODSR), inspired by super resolution (SR) techniques for feature-level images. SODSR comprises three stages: (1) Constructing a 3D model evaluation matrix to select optimal model combinations based on detection accuracy and image quality metrics. (2) Employing Double-thread FDN in the first stage to preprocess images, enhancing feature resolution for potential facial objects. (3) Leveraging Multi-head HyperNet in the second stage to augment face feature detection and improve accuracy. Finally, in the third stage, we introduce AFPGAN, a facial prior feature enhancement network, coupled with StyleGAN2 for texture and contour detail enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that SODSR outperforms existing small object detection (SOD) models in both accuracy and visual fidelity.",

        "abstract": "Perceptive mobile networks (PMN) have been widely recognized as a pivotal pillar for the sixth generation (6G) mobile communication systems. However, the asynchronicity between transmitters and receivers results in velocity and range ambiguity, which seriously degrades the sensing performance. To mitigate the ambiguity, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO) synchronizations have been studied in the literature. However, their performance can be significantly affected by the specific choice of the window functions harnessed. Hence, we set out to find superior window functions capable of improving the performance of CFO and TO estimation algorithms. We firstly derive a near-optimal window, and the theoretical synchronization mean square error (MSE) when utilizing this window. However, since this window is not practically achievable, we then test a practical âwindow function\" by utilizing the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which may lead to excellent synchronization performance.",

        "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in gene regulation and have been implicated in the development of drug resistance in cancer, representing a significant challenge in oncological therapeutics. Despite advancements in computational models predicting RNA-drug interactions, existing frameworks often overlook the complex interplay between circRNAs, drug mechanisms, and disease contexts. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel computational model, circRDRP, that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating disease-specific contexts into the analysis of circRNA-drug interactions. It employs a hybrid graph neural network that combines features from Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) in a two-layer structure, with further enhancement through convolutional neural networks. This approach allows for sophisticated feature extraction from integrated networks of circRNAs, drugs, and diseases. Our results demonstrate that the circRDRP model outperforms existing models in predicting drug resistance, showing significant improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, the model shows robust predictive capability in case studies involving major anticancer drugs such as Cisplatin and Methotrexate, indicating its potential utility in precision medicine. In conclusion, circRDRP offers a powerful tool for understanding and predicting drug resistance mediated by circRNAs, with implications for designing more effective cancer therapies.",

        "abstract": "Represented by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms, nature-inspired metaheuristics have been successfully applied to recommender systems and amply demonstrated effectiveness in particular for multiobjective recommendation. Owing to the population based search paradigm, these algorithms can produce a number of recommendation lists making diverse trade-offs between multiple metrics, meeting the requirements of accuracy, novelty, diversity, and other user preferences. However, these algorithms are criticized for the low efficiency of the optimization process, especially when the number of users is large. To address this issue, this paper proposes an evolutionary multitasking based recommendation method, where each task corresponds to a user and all the tasks are optimized simultaneously, thus highly improving the efficiency of recommendation. In order to enhance the convergence speed, all the users are divided into multiple populations according to the similarity bet...",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has been extensively applied to small object detection, achieving significant advancements. Nevertheless, there remains substantial potential to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of small object detection in Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. In this article, we propose a novel YOLO model with multi-scale, effective, and lightweight methods for traffic small object detection, termed MEL-YOLO. Initially, the improved model reconstructed the multi-scale network structure, the high-resolution feature enhancement network increases size from 40x40 to 160x160. Secondly, the improved model incorporates a decoupled detection head, which separates the classification task from the localization task, thereby improving detection accuracy while increasing detection complexity. Furthermore, we explore the Soft-NMS algorithm to effectively mitigate small object occlusion and reduce missed detection. Finally, this study emphasizes the design of a lightweight model by introducing a model pruning strategy along with the Ghost module. We have selected four C3 modules, each with a substantial number of output channels, to integrate with the Ghost module. This method results in fewer parameters, lower GFLOPs, and higher FPS. Experiment on the VisDrone2019 public dataset, compared to the baseline YOLOv5s, our model demonstrates an improvement of 8.5% in mAP@0.5 and 6.2% increase in mAP@0.5:0.95. Furthermore, there is a 55.7% reduction in parameters, a decrease of 7.0% GFLOPs, and an increase of 11.3% in FPS. To demonstrates the versatility and robustness of MEL-YOLO model, we conducted validation experiments on the SODA10M and CCTSDB datasets, where the mAP@0.5 improved by 1.9% and 1.2%, the FPS increased by 18 frame/s and 6 frame/s, respectively. These results align with our expectations, indicating that our model is a more effective and lightweight algorithm for dense and small objects detection in aerial images.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on a type of hysteretic nonlinear multi-agent system with state constraints. It introduces an adaptive consensus pseudo-inverse control scheme based on Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) and Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLF), ensuring that all states of the closed-loop system are strictly confined within predefined constraints. The main features of this study include: 1) In order to cope with the hysteresis nonlinearity present in the actuators of multi-agent systems, a pseudo-inverse control algorithm has been proposed. This approach avoids the direct construction of a hysteresis inverse model. It achieves control by searching for actual control signals in temporary control laws, and it does not rely on the precise model of the system. Therefore, it can adapt more flexibly to the uncertainties in the system. 2) Within the framework of this control strategy, the seamless integration of fuzzy control, Barrier Lyapunov functions and the hysteresis pseudo-inverse algorithm effectively addresses the full-state constraint control issue in the Preisach hysteresis model. The control signals are elegantly represented in the form of a double integral function, offering a potent solution to the constraints inherent in the Preisach hysteresis model. 3) A multi-agent collaborative control experimental platform was established, incorporating quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles and ground mobile robots. Experimental validation of the proposed control scheme against traditional control approaches demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Multi-satellite intelligent computing, aimed at autonomously generating resource allocation schemes without reliance on ground control, is a crucial technology for the intelligent and integrated Internet of Things (IoT) from space to ground. Existing work focuses on ground-based computation for scheduling schemes, and while some recent studies have adopted graph computing and distributed computing strategies on satellites, they have overlooked the frequent changes in satellite network topologies and the coupling relationships between various types of resources. The robustness advantage of game theory offers a possibility for reliable computation in resource allocation. We introduce a multi-satellite intelligent negotiation mechanism based on cooperative game theory, which for the first time, considers dynamic and autonomous negotiation methods for satellite agents with various types of resources. Subsequently, we propose an intelligent computing algorithm for resource allocation based on convex games and design heuristic strategies for adaptively updating resource allocation schemes. Our simulation results indicate that this method outperforms benchmark algorithms in different scenarios, reducing time consumption by at least 0.151%.",

        "abstract": "Mobilized energy storage (MES) can provide a variety of services for power systems, including peak shaving, frequency regulation, and congestion alleviation. In this paper, we develop an MES sharing approach based on temporal-spatial network (TSN) toward systemwide temporal-spatial flexibility enhancement, specifically in which the heavy-duty vehicles can exchange battery tanks at the energy storage stations connected with power grids. To achieve the temporal-spatial coordination of transportation and power systems, we propose a coordinated scheduling model. A decentralized algorithm based on the improved optimality condition decomposition (OCD) algorithm is proposed to address the information asymmetry between transportation and power systems while enhancing computational efficiency. Case studies based on IEEE 30-/118-bus and transportation systems demonstrate that MESs using the proposed approach can significantly improve the utilization of batteries while reducing operating costs by over 40% compared with stationary energy storages (SESs).",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna (FA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the six-dimensional (6D) positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennasâ movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS design can significantly improve the average sum rate of users manifold as compared to benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or 6DMAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.",

        "abstract": "Many combinatorial multiobjective optimization problems involve very costly-to-evaluate objectives and constraints. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for traditional heuristics to solve these problems with an acceptable amount of computational time. In this paper, we show that offline machine learning can be very useful to assist multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to tackle this kind of problem. We take a complicated real-life multiobjective routing-packing problem as the test bed. We propose to use offline machine learning methods to replace time-consuming packing heuristics for packing feasibility prediction. Experiments show that the machine learning models can be 1,000 times faster than some commonly used packing heuristics and their accuracy can be as high as 98%. We adopt MOEA/D to decompose the problem into a number of single objective subproblems and solve them in a collaborative manner. We propose an encoding strategy to represent each routing scheme and use genetic operators to generate new routes. Experimental studies have been conducted on 100 instances from HUAWEIâs real-world logistics application and two test suites from the literature. Our proposed method can solve each HUAWEI instance in around one minute. Our solutions on the two test suites are comparable to other existing algorithms, and the overall computational cost of our method is significantly lower than others.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of CNN or Transformer, the present mainstream approaches regard an image patch as the reference of the target to perform tracking, which is known as template matching-based trackers. However, most existing template matching-based trackers only consider the per-frame localization accuracy, neglecting the potential distractor (similar object) dependencies among multiple video frames, which poses a fundamental challenge in template matching-based tracking. In this work, we propose a novel comprehensive framework with multi-frame distractor suppression for visual object tracking (MFDSTrack), which explicitly models the temporal history of both the target object and potential distractors. Specifically, we utilize a universal target candidate generation module to detect target candidates (both target and distractors), providing a holistic view of the scene. In addition, a temporal and distractor-aware association module is designed to suppress multi-frame distractors by adopting a simple encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. The encoder accepts inputs of target candidatesâ history, while the decoder takes current target candidate queries and the output of the encoder as inputs to associate current target candidate queries with historical trajectories. We extensively evaluate our trackers, MFDSTrack-SD, MFDSTrack-OS, MFDSTrack-GRM, and MFDSTrack-LT on the LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, UAV123, NFS, and OTB100 benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our methods outperform previous state-of-the-art trackers on seven tracking benchmarks.",

Due to the ultra-dense constellation, efficient beam coverage and interference mitigation are crucial to LEO satellite communication systems, while the conventional directional antennas and fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays both have limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) in beamforming to adapt to the time-varying coverage requirement of terrestrial users. To address this challenge, we propose in this paper utilizing movable antenna (MA) arrays to enhance the satellite beam coverage and interference mitigation. Specifically, given the satellite orbit and the coverage requirement within a specific time interval, the antenna position vector (APV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) of the satellite-mounted MA array are jointly optimized over time to minimize the average signal leakage power to the interference area of the satellite, subject to the constraints of the minimum beamforming gain over the coverage area, the continuous movement of MAs, and the constant modulus of AWV. The corresponding continuous-time decision process for the APV and AWV is first transformed into a more tractable discrete-time optimization problem. Then, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is developed by iteratively optimizing the APV and AWV, where the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is utilized to obtain locally optimal solutions during the iterations. Moreover, to further reduce the antenna movement overhead, a low-complexity MA scheme is proposed by using an optimized common APV over all time slots. Simulation results validate that the proposed MA array-aided beam coverage schemes can significantly decrease the interference leakage of the satellite compared to conventional FPA-based schemes, while the low-complexity MA scheme can achieve a performance comparable ...",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a cooperative sensing framework in the context of future multi-functional network with both communication and sensing ability, where one base station (BS) serves as a sensing transmitter and several nearby BSs serve as sensing receivers. Each receiver receives the sensing signal reflected by the target and communicates with the fusion center (FC) through a wireless multiple access channel (MAC) for cooperative target localization. To improve the localization performance, we present a hybrid information-signal domain cooperative sensing (HISDCS) design, where each sensing receiver transmits both the estimated time delay/effective reflecting coefficient and the received sensing signal sampled around the estimated time delay to the FC. Then, we propose to minimize the number of channel uses by utilizing an efficient Karhunen-LoÃ©ve transformation (KLT) encoding scheme for signal quantization and proper node selection, under the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) constraint and the capacity limits of MAC. A novel matrix-inequality constrained successive convex approximation (MCSCA) algorithm is proposed to optimize the wireless backhaul resource allocation, together with a greedy strategy for node selection. Despite the high non-convexness of the considered problem, we prove that the proposed MCSCA algorithm is able to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of a relaxed problem obtained by relaxing the discrete variables. Besides, a low-complexity quantization bit reallocation algorithm is designed, which does not perform explicit node selection, and is able to harvest most of the performance gain brought by HISDCS. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show that the proposed HISDCS design is able to significantly outperform the baseline schemes.",

        "abstract": "The dual resonant peaks of a long-period fiber grating (LPFG) have been prepared by depositing the polyelectrolyte multilayer films composed of salt-containing poly(diallyldimethyl- ammonium chloride) (PDDA) and salt-containing poly(sodium-p- styrenesulfonate) (PSS). The multilayered polyelectrolyte films of PDDA/PSS were alternately assembled on the surface of the LPFG via electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly approach. The sensing performance of the dual resonant peaks of the LPFG to nanofilms has been further evaluated. The experimental results demonstrated that the optimal sensitivities of the left resonant peak and the right resonant peak in the dual resonant peaks were as high as 52.79 nm/bilayer and 56.09 nm/bilayer, respectively, which were approximately 128 times and 136 times that of another single resonant peak in sequence. Finally, the reason for the emergence of the dual resonant peaks and the corresponding response mechanism to nanofilms were further analyzed and discussed theoretically. These findings are very beneficial for exploring the application of LPFGs in many fields such as biochemical sensing, drug screening, food detection and so on.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel complex convolutional neural network (CNN) CSI enhancer for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), which exploits the correlation between the sensing parameters (such as angle-of-arrival and range) and the channel state information (CSI) to significantly improve the CSI estimation accuracy and further enhance the sensing accuracy. Within the CNN CSI enhancer, we use the complex-valued computation layers to form the CNN, which maintains the phase information of CSI. We also transform the CSI into the sparse angle-delay domain, leading to heatmap images with prominent peaks that can be efficiently processed by CNN. Based on the enhanced CSI outputs, we further propose a novel biased fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based sensing scheme for improving the range sensing accuracy, by artificially introducing phase biasing terms. Extensive simulation results show that the ISAC complex CNN CSI enhancer can converge within 30 training epochs. The normalized mean square error (NMSE) of its CSI estimates is about 20 dB lower than that of the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator, and the bit error rate (BER) of demodulation using the enhanced CSI estimation approaches that with perfect CSI. Finally, the range estimation mean square error (MSE) of the proposed biased FFT-based sensing method approaches that of the subspace-based sensing method, at a much lower complexity.",

        "abstract": "The visual quality of an image is confounded by a number of intertwined factors including its semantic content, distortion characteristics and appearance properties such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, and colourfulness. Distilling high level knowledge about all these quality bearing attributes is crucial for developing objective Image Quality Assessment (IQA). While existing solutions have modeled some of these aspects, a comprehensive solution that involves all these important quality related attributes has not yet been developed. In this paper, we present a new blind IQA (BIQA) model termed Self-supervision and Vision-Language supervision Image QUality Evaluator (SLIQUE) that features a joint vision-language and visual contrastive representation learning framework for acquiring high level knowledge about the images semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties for IQA. For training SLIQUE, we have developed a systematic approach to constructing a first of its kind large image database annotated with all three categories of quality relevant texts. The Text Annotated Distortion, Appearance and Content (TADAC1) database has over 1.6 million images annotated with textual descriptions of their semantic contents, distortion characteristics and appearance properties. The method for constructing TADAC and the database itself will be particularly useful for exploiting vision-language modeling for advanced IQA applications. Extensive experimental results show that SLIQUE has superior performances over state of the art, demonstrating the soundness of its design principle and the effectiveness of its implementation. The link to the TADAC dataset is https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/tadactextannotated-distortion-appearance-and-content",

        "abstract": "A wideband, high-gain, and tri-polarized dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) is proposed in this communication. Its three ports employ three sets of high-order modes of the cylindrical DRA: x-polarized HEM 31Î´ y & HEM 32Î´ y modes, y-polarized HEM 31Î´ x & HEM 32Î´ x modes, and vertical-polarized TM 02Î´ & TM 03Î´ modes. By utilizing high-order modes, the DRA is capable of providing an impressive peak gain, but it also brings the challenge of narrow bandwidth. To address this issue, a unified air-filled method that can almost independently expand the bandwidths of the two HEM-ports and the TM-port is proposed. Specifically, two air rings are introduced at the edge of the cylindrical DRA for the bandwidth enhancement of two HEM-ports, while a cylindrical air region is introduced at the bottom center of the DRA for enhancing the bandwidth of the TM-port. With an appropriate aspect ratio of the DRA selected, it was also found that each port exhibited mode merging, thus effectively expanding the bandwidth. The experimental findings indicate that the tri-polarized DRA under consideration attains an overlapping impedance bandwidth of 27.7% and a peak gain of 7.46 dBi, which are new heights for the same type of DRA.",

        "abstract": "Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (DNFS) have emerged as a hybrid machine learning approach that has found applications in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, transportation, and finance. However, we empirically demonstrate that DNFS is vulnerable to adversarial examples generated by various attack algorithms, raising numerous concerns about its reliability in security-critical scenarios. Existing defense mechanisms designed for DNNs often rely on specific knowledge of attacks and their parameters. Consequently, considering the diversity and uncertainty of potential attacking methods, designing defense strategies to enhance the robustness of DNN-based and DNFS-based models against multiple attacks still remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a comprehensive defense mechanism, named Perturbation Destruction and Information Recovery (PDIR), for image classification tasks, that achieves practical robustness against multiple attacks. PDIR employs a combination of perturbation destruction through randomization and multiplication and information recovery using a pixel-to-pixel network. Experimental results demonstrate that PDIR outperforms state-of-the-art defenses such as JPEG, TVM, ADP, GAL, DVERGE, and TRS against both white-box and black-box attacks.",

        "abstract": "Mobile devices commonly offload latency-sensitive applications to edge servers to meet low-latency requirements. However, existing studies overlook dependency and application hit ratio considerations, hindering effective offloading for multi-applications and multi-tasks. To this end, this paper proposes a Dependent task offloading and Service placement Optimization (DSO) method to maximize the application hit ratio, thereby providing high-quality service. The proposed DSO includes Improved Multi-Agent Q-Learning (IMAQL) and greedy algorithms. IMAQL optimizes service placement via Q-learning, while the greedy algorithm schedules task offloading. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the DSO method enhances the application hit ratio by 4.7% to 11.7% and reduces the completion time by about 3.4% to 4.9% compared to alternative approaches",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted downlink multiuser communication system with improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) that serves as generalized Gaussian signaling and can effectively combat multiuser interference. We focus on the max-min achievable rate optimization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and reflecting phase shifts, subject to the transmit power budget constraint at the access point (AP). We propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on a two-layer iterative procedure, which differs from these existing algorithms that rely on inefficient alternating optimization framework and high computational complexity convex optimization tools. Specifically, in the outer layer procedure, we employ a tractable lower bound of user communication rate to reformulate the original problem and repeatedly update the lower bound in each iteration. In the inner layer procedure, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we decompose the reformulated problem into several convex sub-problems, which can be alternately solved by closed-form solutions. Furthermore, we study the initialization, convergence, and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we simplify the algorithm to make it applicable for the cases of conventional proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) and without IRS. Finally, numerical results validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over benchmarking algorithm in terms of rate performance and average execution time.",

        "abstract": "The vehicle road cooperation system is designed to enable intelligent and collaborative communication between vehicles and vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians to reduce road accidents and improve road efficiency. As a critical component of this, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is expected to achieve efficient information interaction between vehicles and support services such as collision warning and operation assistance. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles and channel fading, V2V communication suffers from link instability, high latency, and low resource utilization. To address these issues, this paper proposes a High-Reliability Low-Latency Intelligent Geographic Routing (HRLLIGR) protocol based on the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol to improve its performance in such highly dynamic networks. The main mechanisms of HRLLIGR include a reliable greedy forwarding algorithm based on the evaluation of link stability metrics, a low-latency area prediction forwarding algorithm for routing voids, and an intelligent routing update mechanism to reduce routing overhead. Simulation results suggest that the HRLLIGR protocol outperforms traditional routing protocols such as Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR), and GPSR regarding reliability, latency, and overhead. Specifically, compared to the GPSR protocol, it achieves 13.7% improvement in packet delivery rate, 21.3% reduction in average end-to-end latency, and 15.1% decrease in routing overhead.",

        "abstract": "Human emotions vary over time, which can be vividly described as a stream of emotions. Observing the emotion stream in daily life provides valuable insights into an individual's mental state. However, existing research in emotion understanding has mainly focused on classification tasks, assigning an emotion category to a well-trimmed segment or each frame within a continuous signal. In contrast, the task of temporal emotion detection, which involves locating the boundaries of emotion segments and recognizing their categories in untrimmed signals, has not been fully explored. To advance research in this area, this paper introduces an in-the-wild Audio-Visual Emotion Stream (AVES) dataset, which is reliably annotated with the time boundaries and emotion category for each emotion segment in the videos. Thus, AVES can serve as a solid benchmark for temporal emotion detection tasks. Moreover, considering the flexible boundaries and varying durations of emotion segments, we propose a Boundary Combination Network (BoCoNet) for temporal emotion detection, which leverages short-term temporal context information to first predict the boundaries of emotion segments and then locate the entire emotion segments. Extensive experiments conducted on various representative unimodal and multimodal representations demonstrate that BoCoNet achieves state-of-the-art results. The AVES dataset will be released to the research community. We expect that this paper can advance the research on emotion stream and temporal emotion detection",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the joint active transceiver and passive beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of an IRS-aided multi-streams multiuser multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel (MIMO-BC) downlink transmission system. Due to the coupling of the transceiver parameters, the considered WSR optimization problem is highly non-convex and thus challenging to solve. Different from the normally used methods, such as the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE), we rely on the matrix fractional programming (MFP) theory to derive an effective algorithm to the WSR problem. Specifically, we reformulate the original problem into a tractable one by exploiting the special structure of the objective function, i.e., a MFP which involves a matrix ratio inside a logarithm in the objective function. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is then devised to decompose the reformulated problem into four subproblems, which optimize the introduced auxiliary variable, the transmit beamforming matrix, the receive matrix, and the reflecting beamforming matrix by fixing other variables respectively. Through the matrix quadratic transform, we reformulate the MFP problem as a convex one, and thus obtain the optimal transmit beamforming matrix. By leveraging the optimality conditions for unconstrained optimization problems, the optimal receive beamforming matrix and the introduced auxiliary variable are derived in closed form. For solving the passive beamforming subproblem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA). Since the computational complexity of SCA is relatively high, we propose a computationally efficient method based on manifold optimization (MO) to optimize the passive beamforming matrix. Finally, we also consider the robust beamforming design when the system suffers from imperfect CSI. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Unlabeled text representation learning (UTRL), encompassing static word embeddings such as Word2Vec and contextualized word embeddings such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT), aims to capture semantic word relationships in a low-dimensional space without the need for manual labeling. These word embeddings are invaluable for downstream tasks such as document classification and clustering. However, the surge of short texts generated daily on social media platforms results in sparse word cooccurrences, compromising UTRL outcomes. Contextualized models such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and BERT, while impressive, often struggle with predicting the next word due to sparse word sequences in short texts. To address this, we introduce CGraphNet, a contrastive graph context prediction model designed for UTRL. This approach converts short texts into graphs, establishing links between sequentially occurring words. Information from the next word and its neighbors informs the target prediction, a process referred to as graph context prediction, mitigating sparse word cooccurrence issues in brief sentences. To minimize noise, an attention mechanism assigns importance to neighbors, while a contrastive objective encourages more distinctive representations by comparing the target word with its neighbors. Our experiments demonstrate CGraphNetâs superior performance over other baselines, particularly in classification and clustering tasks on real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "Compressed gas energy storage is characterized by its large capacity, extended operating life, cleanliness and low carbon emissions, making it an important and promising development trend in energy storage technology. Compared with compressed air energy storage (CAES) mainly composed of nitrogen, compressed carbon dioxide energy storage (CCES) has higher energy storage capacity due to its superior fluid properties. Existing literature mainly focuses on the thermodynamic performance of CCES and the optimization of parameters and structures. There are few studies on carbon energy storage power plants participating in power system scheduling. This paper proposes an arbitrage strategy and techno-economic analysis for transcritical compressed CO 2 storage (TC-CCES) system. Taking into account the physical properties of CO 2 at high temperature and pressure, a refined model is proposed to overcome errors resulting from the ideal gas assumption commonly used in conventional CO 2 modeling. Incremental piecewise linear method is used to solve nonlinear problems in the model. Based on actual calculation examples from four provinces in China, the effectiveness of the arbitrage strategy model with TC-CCES proposed in this paper is verified in the electricity market. The revenue of the TC-CCES with active power reserve increased by 7.46%. The breakeven point of the peak-valley ratio is 1.71, below which TC-CCES will not participate in the energy market. Under the same design conditions, the energy storage density of TC-CCES is 7.9 times that of CAES, resulting in higher annual income.",

        "abstract": "With the popularity of blockchains, low transaction throughput has become a significant bottleneck in applications such as cryptocurrencies. Payment channel networks (PCNs) have received attention as a way to improve throughput. However, due to the difficulty of predicting future transactions for nodes, the transactions are prone to failure when the channel balances do not meet required conditions. It has been shown that increasing buffers (queues) in PCNs can increase the success rate of transactions and throughput. Nevertheless, there is no effective transaction scheduling strategy in buffers when transaction values are flexible and variable. To solve this problem, we first formulate the Scheduling Problem in PCNs (named PSP), and then prove it is NP-hard. We design a neural network solver based on the Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture and train the solver using the reinforcement learning method. With the solver, we first give two scheduling strategies to maximize transaction throughput, and then design a PCN simulator for performance evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority and various performances of our proposal and illustrate that our proposal can get a significant advantage in terms of the transaction throughput compared to the existing works.",

MEC-RDESN offers efficient QoS forecasting while maintaining high accuracy. We can identify the edge region to which a user belongs in real time while moving by leveraging mobile sensing technology. We employ a dynamic echo state network characterized by multi-service adaptability to retain information about services invoked by users to ensure real-time training and forecasting accuracy. Our approach is validated through a series of experiments using both public and collected datasets. The experiments demonstrate that MEC-RDESN achieves the goal of fast forecasting while ensuring its forecasting accuracy in diverse application scenarios.",

This article proposes a model checking approach of Ï -independent unbounded Petri nets. First, this approach can ensure the complete state space required for model checking by analyzing the enabled/unenabled marking set of conditionally enabled transition. Second, a comprehensive model checking process of Ï -independent unbounded PN is presented, including the generation of extended new modified reachability graph. Third, two theorems are presented to prove that extended new modified reachability graph includes complete reachable markings and sequences of transitions. Finally, the proposed new approach is illustrated through a practical example.",

        "abstract": "Visual tracking is a vitally important task in computer vision, which is widely used in intelligent surveillance and traffic control, etc. Currently, real-time multiple object tracking methods are still not mature in practical applications and still need to be further refined to enhance their performance especially in complex and crowded environments. These existing tracking methods focus on designing the strategies of target association, based on the predictions of object detectors. Since the detection and association phases are independent, many duplicate calculations may occur in the feature extraction procedure, which is time-consuming. Aiming to effectively combine these two phases, an integrated network architecture is proposed in this work to extract the common features for object detection and the differentiating features for target association simultaneously. The multi-task head structure and the specific loss function of this integrated network have been designed to avoid coupling issues in the model training procedure. Furthermore, sample groups of adjacent frames are used to enhance the processing capacity of the personal gradual variance of these tracked targets. Background modeling and a Kalman filter are used to improve tracking accuracy. In the simulation, the proposed tracker achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers on the tested publicly available databases.",

        "abstract": "The potential of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance performance for various user types across different cell locations in large-scale networks, as well as its comparative effectiveness against other methods such as interference mitigation (IM), remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, in this paper the coverage probability (CP) for location-dependent users with RIS and without RIS is derived in closed-form expressions, through which the performance of RIS can be readily evaluated for different types of users. For some special practical cases, these closed-form expressions of CP can be simplified to very simple forms, which quantitatively reveal the potential of RIS on CP improvement. Also, the closed-form expressions of CP for various types of users with IM are derived to give a comparison with RIS. Furthermore, by employing the Jensen's inequality and Taylor expansion, the performance assessment of our analytical results and an accurate approximation for the case that RISs are randomly deployed are provided. The theoretical results are consistent with simulation results, which demonstrate that for different types of users under different performance requirements, proper choice for the methods of enhancing user performance (i.e., RIS-assisted or IM, and hence the operation model of RIS) is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Subset selection, a fundamental problem in various domains, is to choose a subset of elements from a large candidate set under a given objective or multiple objectives. Pareto optimization for subset selection (POSS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for addressing subset selection problems. Recently, some POSS variants have been proposed to further improve its performance. In this paper, we propose a new POSS variant, named Targeted Pareto Optimization for Subset Selection (TPOSS). TPOSS differs from POSS in four aspects: problem formulation, population initialization, mutation, and environmental selection. The main idea of TPOSS is to focus the search on the target region of subset selection with respect to the subset cardinality in order to improve the search efficiency. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare TPOSS with six state-of-the-art algorithms on three subset selection tasks (i.e., sparse regression, unsupervised feature selection, and hypervolume subset selection) where the size of the candidate sets ranges from 20 to 400. Experimental results show that with respect to the objective value of the best feasible subset, TPOSS outperforms the other algorithms on all the three tasks, which suggests the potential of TPOSS to enhance subset selection in various domains.",

        "abstract": "Accurate Object distance estimation with recognition is essential for various computer vision (CV) applications, including autonomous vehicles and many military operations. While significant advancements have been achieved in supervised and self-supervised techniques for short-range and real-time recognition, existing methods often focus on monocular depth estimation. They are constrained by the limitations of supervised deep learning (DL) models. Taking advantage of temporal information from sequential frames through attention mechanisms to address these challenges offers a promising avenue for enhancing recognition quality. For a real-time military object recognition system, this study integrates RGB images along Depth maps from the KITTI Dataset for short-range measurements. Due to the limitation of the KITTI dataset, a synthetic dataset is generated for long-range object recognition. YOLOv8 is trained for real-time object detection, utilizing the KITTI and a synthetic dataset for long-range analysis. Our method achieves an RMSE of 1.24 meters and an RMSE(log) of 0.18 for depth estimation, outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, the system accurately detects objects at distances of up to 250 meters, with an average inference time of 15 ms per frame for short-range detection and 18 ms per frame for long-range detection. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approachâs superior accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an emerging technology that is able to fully exploit the spatial variation of wireless channels by controlling the 3D positions and 3D rotations of distributed antennas/antenna surfaces at the transmitter/receiver. In this letter, we apply 6DMA at the base station (BS) to enhance its wireless sensing performance over a given set of regions. To this end, we first divide each region into a number of equal-size subregions and select one typical target location within each subregion. Then, we derive an expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the directions of arrival (DoAs) from these typical target locations in all regions, which sheds light on the sensing performance of 6DMA enhanced systems in terms of a power gain and a geometric gain. Next, we minimize the CRB for DoA estimation via jointly optimizing the positions and rotations of all 6DMAs at the BS, subject to practical movement constraints, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem sub-optimally. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement in DoA estimation accuracy achieved by the proposed 6DMA sensing scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes, for both isotropic and directive antenna radiation patterns.",

        "abstract": "In the design of multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithms, swarm leaders, i.e., the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest), are expected to guide the particles towards Pareto optimal solutions. However, most existing MOPSO algorithms focus on selecting such leaders from the archive of candidate solutions to approximate the Pareto front (PF) that may not yield good approximations of the Pareto set (PS). To address this challenge, this work proposes to predict both pbest and gbest for each particle by explicitly approximating the manifold structure of the PS, following the regularity property of multiobjective optimization problems. Thus, we design a leader prediction based multiobjective particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm. In our algorithm, a self-organizing mapping method is adopted at each iteration to capture the manifold structure from the current swarm to predict leaders. Specifically, pbest is pinpointed by mapping the particle onto the neuron of SOM, while gbest is estimated by randomly selecting from the neighborhood neurons. In this way, the particles of a swarm in PPSO are guided by the predicted pbest and gbest to approximate the Pareto optimal solutions. The developed PPSO is empirically verified with several representative algorithms, on several benchmark test instances and real-world problems. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantages of leader prediction for MOPSO over other approaches.",

        "abstract": "Out of consideration for the dynamic demand of energy dispatching with local affine constraints and globally-shared nonconvex nonsmooth hybrid cost arising from highly prevalent intermittent renewable energy sources, load effects and multiple fuel resources, the constraint-projection-based actor-critic algorithm is investigated to solve the dynamic distributed economic dispatch problem in microgrids. To characterize the generation power against the fuel cost, we denote various fuel choices by segmented nonconvex costs. To help address the lack of prior knowledge of the system model, we propose a novel distributed actor-critic algorithm to find the feasible power. The algorithm combines the actor policy network with the multiplier splitting approach and projected gradient method, maps the action's policy distribution to feasible power interval, and finally realizes real-time dispatching in continuous action space by approximating the evaluation function from the critic network. The convergence of the algorithm is theoretically analyzed. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by several simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and development of a wideband, circularly polarized lens antenna with high gain for millimeter-wave applications. The antenna is composed of dielectric units with varying lengths, engineered to facilitate the conversion of linearly polarized electromagnetic wave into circularly polarized wave. A rigorous theoretical analysis of these dielectric units reveals their ability to achieve a 90Â° phase difference between the two orthogonal electrical components within a substantial bandwidth. Subsequent empirical measurements corroborate these findings, affirming the antennaâs capacity to deliver a prominently wide axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. To achieve circular polarization (CP) and enhancement on gain, the design culminates in the construction of a convex lens, formed using these dielectric units. The proposed antenna demonstrates a remarkable impedance bandwidth spanning from 21.7 to 67 GHz, where Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) remains consistently below 2. Additionally, the AR bandwidth is over 115.9% from 18 GHz to 67 GHz, ensuring AR below 3dB. The measured peak gain of the antenna registers at 20.6dBic. This study extensively explores the intricate relationship between the relative dielectric constant and the dielectric unit. This exploration has yielded a novel and cost-effective solution for achieving ultra-broadband CP with high gain, specifically tailored for millimeter-wave applications.",

        "abstract": "This article copes with the distributed control and target tracking (DCTT) problem in general linear and Lipschitz multiagent systems (MASs). In comparison to the traditional DCTT algorithms that were developed for MASs in ideal conditions, two schemes based upon a resilient protocol are proposed for linear and nonlinear MASs to estimate and track a mobile target where all agents are subject to composite attacks, including camouflage attacks, DoS attacks, sensor attacks, and actuator attacks. Based on the digital twin approach, a twin layer (TL) with high privacy and security is introduced to separate the problem of DCTT into two tasks: 1) handling DoS attacks on the TL and defending against sensor and 2) actuator attacks on the cyberâphysical layer (CPL). First, two distributed estimation algorithms are established to reconstruct the agents and target dynamics for every agent on the TL in the presence of DoS attacks. Second, using the reconstructed agents and target dynamics on the TL, a resilient distributed control protocol is designed to resist sensor and actuator attacks on the CPL. The current scheme guarantees the achievement of control and target tracking such that the DCTT error of the proposed design is ultimately bounded in terms of linear matrix inequality. By applying two simulation examples, the presented algorithms are also validated.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things systems are used in many aspects of our lives. Thanks to TinyML algorithms, they provide several new and smart functionalities that were impossible before. However, implementing such a solution on a large scale and maintaining it over time is a big challenge. This is due to the need not only to update the device firmware to remove errors and extend the functionality of the devices but also to update the ML models. This imposes several requirements for device monitoring and management mechanisms. In this work, we discuss not only the required aspects that an IoT system should meet, but we also show how they fit into the ML model management process.",

        "abstract": "Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low parallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This article proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardwareâsoftware codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. In addition, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intranode edgesâ computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 245 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85 392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of 7.0 $\times$ (up to 27.8 $\times$ ) over CPUs and 5.8 $\times$ (up to 98.8 $\times$ ) over GPUs. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a 2.5 $\times$ (up to 5.9 $\times$ ) average performance improvement and 1.7 $\times$ (up to 4.1 $\times$ ) average energy efficiency enhancement.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most representative recommendation solutions, traditional collaborative filtering models typically have limitations in dealing with large-scale, sparse data to capture complex relationships between users and items. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides powerful tools such as deep neural networks to overcome the data sparsity issue with typical collaborative filtering models. Existing works on AI driven recommender systems are focusing on improving recommendation accuracy by extracting rich user/item features from multi-source data with deep learning tools to build more accurate user preference model. How to ensure the responsibility of AI driven recommender systems is still a big challenge. On one hand, AI driven recommender systems need to access raw data such as user profiles to train recommendation model, which face the risk of leaking user privacy information. On the other hand, the ever increasing volume of user/item interaction records raise the efficien...",

        "abstract": "As electronic technology advances, a growing number of consumer electronics products emerge. Accurate and trustworthy consumer electronics product recommendation can improve user experiences and thus attract more consumers. Thus, big data analytics for distributed learning for personalized consumer recommendation is crucial. Distributed learning enables fast processing and analysis of big data through a decentralized way. This manner enables consumer electronic devices to respond faster to user requests and provide more real-time and accurate information services. In this article, we study a distributed composite sharing learning problem in large-scale networked communication systems where the nodes in the whole system endeavor to minimize a finite sum of two local cost functions plus a common possibly non-smooth coupling composite term. One of the local cost functions is further constituted by the average of some component functions. Problems of this nature usually called the multi-node sharing problem emerge in a number of applications in consumer electronics, mostly evident in image processing and recognition classification, recommender systems, etc. To tackle this problem, we provide an efficient variance-reduced distributed proximal stochastic gradient algorithm (named VR-DPSG) to obtain a lower computation cost. Then, we furnish a concise demonstration that establishes its linear convergence under milder conditions in comparison to prevailing distributed stochastic works. Our results indicate that VR-DPSG matches the linear rate of the centralized ones in the absence of any additional conditions. Extensive simulations illustrate the efficacy of VR-DPSG and validate our theoretical discoveries.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale, big-variant, high-quality data are crucial for developing robust and successful deep-learning models for medical applications since they potentially enable better generalization performance and avoid overfitting. However, the scarcity of high-quality labeled data always presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by developing controllable diffusion models for medical image synthesis, called DiffBoost. We leverage recent diffusion probabilistic models to generate realistic and diverse synthetic medical image data that preserve the essential characteristics of the original medical images by incorporating edge information of objects to guide the synthesis process. In our approach, we ensure that the synthesized samples adhere to medically relevant constraints and preserve the underlying structure of imaging data. Due to the random sampling process by the diffusion model, we can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic images with diverse appearances. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an extensive set of medical image segmentation experiments on multiple datasets, including Ultrasound breast (+13.87%), CT spleen (+0.38%), and MRI prostate (+7.78%), achieving significant improvements over the baseline segmentation methods. The promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DiffBoost for medical image segmentation tasks and show the feasibility of introducing a first-ever text-guided diffusion model for general medical image segmentation tasks. With carefully designed ablation experiments, we investigate the influence of various data augmentations, hyper-parameter settings, patch size for generating random merging mask settings, and combined influence with different network architectures.

        "abstract": "Identifying the biomarkers from the personalized gene interaction network of individual patients is important for disease diagnosis. However, existing methods not only ignore the prior biomarkers for practical use but also ignore the observability of the entire system. Therefore, this paper proposes a new constrained multi-objective optimization-based temporal network observability model (CMTNO) to identify biomarkers, which not only requires minimizing the number of selected nodes including ordinary nodes and prior nodes (the first optimization objective) but also maximizing the number of selected prior nodes (the second optimization objective) on the premise of ensuring network observability (the constraint condition). Considering the temporal feature of cancer (patients belong to different stages and each patient contains one task), an experience learning-based constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is designed to solve the CMTNO problems. The selected probabilities of ordinary nodes and prior nodes are treated as experience, stored in two separate archives and updated by the optimal solutions on each task. Experience utilization refers to using two archives to generate new initial populations for new patients, in order to improve the optimization efficiency of the algorithm. Besides, a two-step neighbor-based connectivity method is proposed to distinguish different nodes with similar connectivity to further improve the effectiveness of archives. The proposed model and algorithm are evaluated on three kinds of cancer patients' data under two kinds of network models, and results show their effectiveness in identifying effective biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "The exploration of utilizing reconfigurable circuits with parallel computing capabilities has been conducted to enhance sorting performance and reduce power consumption. However, most sorting algorithms using dedicated processors are based on parallelization designs of serial algorithms without considering the design method of large-scale integrated circuits. This results in various issues, including the overuse of I/O interface resources, on-chip storage resources, and complex layout wiring. In this paper, we extend the 2-tuple relation in the Uniform Recurrence Equation (URE) structure used to define the systolic array to n-tuples, and the extended structure is flexible in defining I/O bandwidth and concurrency. Then we define the Multi-Concurrency Systolic Sorter Array (MCSSA) algorithm based on the extended URE structure, which has a flexible 4N/n time complexity based on the n-tuple relation. Moreover, this systolic array can simultaneously sort two independent sequences, increasing the reuse of resources. Afterwards, we encapsulate each n-tuple into a Processing Element(PE) cell. The entire MCSSA consists of these interconnected PE cells, each of which can be customised in terms of data bit width and type. Last but not least, we have improved the merge tree structure called MC-merge tree. The concurrency of this algorithm can also be flexibly defined, we use this algorithm combined with MCSSA to cope with large-scale sorting scenarios. In our experiments, we have demonstrated the speed-up ratio of MCSSA relative to other state of the art (SOTA) sorting algorithms. Inheriting the unity and simplicity from the Systolic Array architecture, MCSSA achieves a maximum 73.17x acceleration ratio on the U200. In addition, the MC-merge tree expands the MCSSA sorting scale with a maximum of 450.56 times while maintaining the advantage of the acceleration ratio. The results of our study demonstrate that MCSSA and MC-merge tree have better acceleration, throughput and scala...",

        "abstract": "Despite the significant advancements in single-agent evolutionary reinforcement learning, research exploring evolutionary reinforcement learning within multi-agent systems is still in its nascent stage. The integration of evolutionary algorithms (EA) and reinforcement learning (RL) has partially mitigated RL's reliance on the environment and provided it with an ample supply of data. Nonetheless, existing studies primarily focus on the indirect collaboration between RL and EA, which lacks sufficient exploration on the effective balance of individual and team rewards. To address this problem, this study introduces game theory to establish a dynamic cooperation framework between EA and RL, and proposes a multi-agent evolutionary reinforcement learning based on cooperative games. This framework facilitates more efficient direct collaboration between RL and EA, enhancing individual rewards while ensuring the attainment of team objectives. Initially, a cooperative policy is formed through a joint network to simplify the parameters of each agent to speed up the overall training process. Subsequently, RL and EA engage in cooperative games to determine whether RL jointly optimizes the same policy based on Pareto optimal results. Lastly, through double objectives optimization, a balance between the two types of rewards is achieved, with EA focusing on team rewards and RL focusing on individual rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms its single-algorithm counterparts in terms of competitiveness.",

        "abstract": "Exploring potential association between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases is an essential part of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Since determining these relationships experimentally is resource-intensive and time-consuming, therefore computational methods have emerged as an attractive way to address this issue. However, existing computational approaches for inferring lncRNA-disease associations (LDA), miRNA-disease associations (MDA) and lncRNA-miRNA interactions (LMI) tend to focus on single task, neglecting the benefits of leveraging multiple biomolecular interactions and domain-specific knowledge for multi-task prediction. Furthermore, labeled data for LDA, MDA and LMI is scarce and costly in real-word applications, making it challenging for models to learn comprehensive node embedding patterns. Building on our previous work, this paper proposes a multi-task prediction model (called SSCLMD) that employs self-supervised contrastive learning on attribute and topology graphs to identify potential LDAs, MDAs and LMIs. Specifically, firstly, domain knowledge of lncRNAs, miRNAs and diseases as well as their interactions are exploited to construct attribute graph and topology graph, respectively. Then, the nodes are encoded in the attribute and topology spaces to extract the specific and common feature. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is performed to adaptively fuse the embedding from different views. SSCLMD incorporates a contrastive self-supervised learning task as a regularize to guide the learning of node embeddings in both attribute and topology space without relying on labels. Severing as a regularize in multi-task learning paradigm, it to improves the model's generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on 2 manually curated datasets demonstrate that SSCLMD significantly outperforms other baseline methods in LDA, MDA and LMI prediction tasks. Additionally, case studies on both new and old datasets further s...",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a compact gain-boosted up-conversion mixer integrated with input active balun in D-band. To simplify the driving stages of power amplifiers and enable large-scale integration in millimeter-wave systems, a proposed gain-boosted technique is introduced. This technique enhances the conversion gain of the mixer without increasing power consumption or footprint, achieved through the synergistic combination of negative resistance compensation (NRC) and current-reuse techniques. Furthermore, a wideband balance compensation technique is utilized at the local oscillator (LO) input, and an active balun is implemented at the intermediate frequency (IF) input, replacing the conventional large-area passive balun. These innovations lead to a more compact high-gain mixer design while achieving high-speed performance. For validation, the proposed up-conversion mixer is fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS. It boasts a total area of 0.15 mm $^{2}$ (0.033 $\\lambda^{2}$ ), with a core area of 0.024 mm $^{2}$ (0.0052 $\\lambda^{2}$ ). It achieves a measured conversion gain of 4.1 dB at 136 GHz. The measured saturation power is $-$ 5 dBm, with a data transmission rate of 42 Gbps, while consuming a power consumption of 10.8 mW only. To the best of our knowledge, this design achieves the highest conversion gain among D-band up-conversion mixers in CMOS technology and represents the smallest footprint among up-conversion mixers integrated with balun in D-band.",

        "abstract": "In the world of big data, training large-scale machine learning problems has gained considerable attention. Numerous innovative optimization strategies have been presented in recent years to accelerate the large-scale training process. However, the possibility of further accelerating the training process of various optimization algorithms remains an unresolved subject. To begin addressing this difficult problem, we exploit the researched findings that when training data are independent and identically distributed, the learning problem on a smaller dataset is not significantly different from the original one. Upon that, we propose a stagewise training technique that grows the size of the training set exponentially while solving nonsmooth subproblem. We demonstrate that our stagewise training via exponentially growing the size of the training sets (STEGSs) are compatible with a large number of proximal gradient descent and gradient hard thresholding (GHT) techniques. Interestingly, we demonstrate that STEGS can greatly reduce overall complexity while maintaining statistical accuracy or even surpassing the intrinsic error introduced by GHT approaches. In addition, we analyze the effect of the training data growth rate on the overall complexity. The practical results of applying $l_{2,1}$ -and $l_0$ -norms to a variety of large-scale real-world datasets not only corroborate our theories but also demonstrate the benefits of our STEGS framework.",

        "abstract": "A Dynamically Weighted Directed Network (DWDN) fundamentally illustrates the complex interactions among massive nodes from a big-data-oriented application, like the dynamic interactions among numerous terminals in a metropolitan network management system (MNMS). A High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) tensor is able to flexibly quantize it, where lots of entries are missing primarily due to the impossibility in discovering the full interactions among numerous nodes. Such an HDI tensor can be effectively represented by a Latent Factorization of Tensors (LFT) model for extracting useful knowledge like potential links from it, while existing LFT models commonly adopt general regularization schemes without considering an HDI tensor's imbalanced known data, which impairs their generality. To address this issue, this paper develops an Fine-grained Regularized Nonnegative Latent factorization of tensors (FRNL) model based on two-fold ideas: a) innovatively proposing an Swish-p-based and fine-grained regularization scheme where the regularization effects acting on individual latent feature is proportional to its related instance count for precisely representing the imbalanced distribution of an HDI tensor's known data; b) implementing the self-adaptation of the model hyper-parameters via a fuzzy controller to achieve high practicability. The convergence ability of FRNL is justified theoretically. Experimental studies on eight DWDNs emerging from a real MNMS illustrate that compared with state-of-the-art LFT models, the proposed FRNL model obtains significantly higher learning accuracy and computational efficiency in representing a DWDN.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing awareness of consumer health and the arrival of the big data era, how to efficiently extract valuable knowledge from massive health text information has become an urgent problem. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a new approach for intelligent processing of consumer health information with its powerful natural language processing. This article proposes a method for LLMs-driven health text information analysis in consumer electronics. It demonstrates how LLMs effectively analyze consumer health text information and improve the accuracy of health information generation. Based on LLMs, the proposed method first establishes a health text information component recognition model (HTICRM), which aims to identify the location and type of key information input into consumer health text. Then when there are diverse positions of text information components that cannot be accurately analyzed, this article uses LLMs reflection and P-Tuning v2 to generate health text information components to narrow the feature gap between the generated data and general consumer health domain data. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed method can help to promote the further application and development of LLMs in the field of consumer health, providing consumers with more scientific and accurate health guidance.",

        "abstract": "Building modeling, specifically heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load and equivalent energy storage calculations, represent a key focus for decarbonization of buildings and smart grid controls. In this paper, an ultra-fast one-minute resolution Hybrid Machine Learning Model (HMLM) is proposed as part of a novel contribution in the field of residential physics-based smart home surrogate modeling. Emulation of white box models, or digital twins, with editable parameters through machine learning (ML) meta-modeling serves as an alternative to wide-spread experimental big data collection. The HMLM employs combined k-means clustering with multiple linear regression (MLR) to emulate minutely HVAC power timestep-to-timestep with satisfactory nRMSE error of less than 10% across an entire year test set. An approach is also described to characterize HVAC systems as generalized storage (GES) devices to unify household appliance and virtual power plant (VPP) controls in accordance with industry Communication Technology Association (CTA) 2045 protocol and Energy Star metrics. Synthetic output data from experimentally calibrated EnergyPlus models for three existing smart homes managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is employed in residential case studies and a discussion provided for the large-scale application to hundreds of homes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-label few-shot learning (ML-FSL) refers to the task of tagging previously unseen images with a set of relevant labels, giving a small number of training examples. Modeling the correlations between instances and labels, formulated in the existing methods, allows us to extract more available knowledge from limited examples. However, they simply explore the instance and label correlations with a uniform importance assumption without considering the discrepancy of importance in different instances or labels, making the utilization of instance and label correlations a bottleneck for ML-FSL. To tackle the issue, we propose a unified framework named bilateral correlation reconstruction (BCR) to enable the network to effectively mine underlying instance and label correlations with varying importance information from both instance-to-label and label-to-instance perspectives. Specifically, from the instance-to-label perspective, we refine prototypes per category by reweighting each image with its specific instance-importance degree extracted from the similarity between the instance and the corresponding category. From the label-to-instance perspective, we smooth labels for each image by recovering latent label-importance with considering the integrated topology of all samples in a task. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate that BCR could outperform existing ML-FSL methods by large margins.",

        "abstract": "The rich motion and appearance cues between consecutive frames are crucial for robust visual tracking. However, most existing tracking methods are still limited in designing different components to separately employ corresponding cues and even ignore one of them. This makes them difficult to maintain effective interaction between different cues, thus hindering the models from fostering a comprehensive understanding of the target objects. To address these issues, we propose a unified spatio-temporal cues learning framework (named USCLTrack) that comprehensively mines the variation patterns of targets between consecutive frames in complex video streams. Specifically, USCLTrack firstly aggregates motion and appearance cues into shared queries to provide the bridge of interaction between both cues. Then, it directly generates object locations on the condition of these shared queries in an autoregressive manner, unifying different cues to guide future inferences. To effectively learn multiple spatio-temporal cues aggregated in the shared queries, we develop a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. This mechanism integrates motion cues with appearance cues according to the time steps for ensuring temporal consistency. Moreover, it concurrently captures motion trends and appearance changes to facilitate the understanding of the target objects. Extensive experiments on eight popular tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed USCLTrack.",

        "abstract": "A multifeed metasurface-inspired antenna with power-combining capability is proposed for D-band chip integration. The antenna consists of three patch layers including the bottom on-chip patch for power-combining with eight differential feed ports, the middle patch on the substrate board for electromagnetic wave tightly coupling from the chip patch, and the metasurface-inspired patch array on the top of the board for performance enhancement. The characteristic mode analysis is applied to reveal the desired mode behaviors and guide the antenna design. To enhance the antenna efficiency and alleviate the impact of assembly errors, an air-gap layer is applied between the chip and substrate board. Based on this antenna configuration, a new simple package architecture is introduced for chip integration to avoid high-frequency electrical interconnection. In addition, multifeed technology is applied for power combing applications and high power radiation. To validate the proposed antenna and simplify the experiments, the cascaded T-junctions are applied to provide the eight differential feedings and the on-chip parts are fabricated using back-end-of-line technology of SiGe BiCMOS process. According to the measurements, the proposed multifeed antenna has good estimated radiation performance including operating bandwidth of 22.9%, peak gain of 7.97 dBi at 135 GHz with antenna radiation efficiency of 80%. The proposed antenna and package architecture are good candidates for 6G communication and the other sub-terahertz systems.",

        "abstract": "As power systems evolve from synchronous to inverter-based generation, short-term voltage stability evaluation plays an increasingly important role. Voltage perturbations become faster and highly variable, exposing systems to much larger risks of cascading faults. Therefore, assessing the severity and origin of potential voltage deviations becomes a critical step in risk-based vulnerability analysis of modern power systems. In this paper, a novel approach that evaluates rapid post-fault voltage deviations for both online and offline short-term instability quantification and classification is investigated. The findings indicate that the approach is intuitive and effective in automatically determining the severity and type of instability. Such an output enables grid operators to anticipate and prioritize potential high-risk events and act with suitable preventive and/or corrective actions. Finally, the paper provides future research directions that deal with the open grid resilience challenges. Particularly, the challenges related to post-disturbance dynamic system strength evaluation are addressed.",

        "abstract": "low-profile circularly-polarized (CP) hybrid antenna for beam-switching and orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode-switching is proposed in this paper. It hybridizes reconfigurable folded reflectarray (RFRA) and reconfigurable folded transmitarray (RFTA) simultaneously. By employing two pairs of 1-bit reconfigurable unit cells of (0Â°, 180Â°) and (90Â°, 270Â°), the hybrid antenna achieves 2-bit phase resolution. More importantly, the hybrid structure alleviates the design burden on the bias network, because only half of the unit cells are necessary to be reconfigurable, while the other half are fixed. Meanwhile, the reconfigurable unit cells are dispersed on both of the top and bottom metasurface. To validate the hybrid idea, two prototypes operating at center frequency of 26 GHz are analyzed and measured, in which the metal-stub/open-circuit is used to model the âON/OFFâ state of PIN diode for simplification. The prototypes can respectively achieve beam-switching among four fixed beams and OAM mode-switching among four OAM modes, respectively. Additionally, compared with 1-bit RFRA or RFTA, the proposed prototype for beam-switching achieves a much wider 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 27.1% and a higher aperture efficiency of 18.1%. Meanwhile, the other prototype achieves higher-order OAM mode-switching between l =-3 and l =1. The measured OAM purity is 75% and 86% at 26 GHz, respectively, and more than 65% purity is achieved within 24-28 GHz.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the energy-efficient hybrid beamforming design for a multi-functional integrated sensing, communications, and powering (ISCAP) system. In this system, a base station (BS) with a hybrid analog-digital (HAD) architecture sends unified wireless signals to communicate with multiple information receivers (IRs), sense multiple point targets, and wirelessly charge multiple energy receivers (ERs) at the same time. To facilitate the energy-efficient design, we present a novel HAD architecture for the BS transmitter, which allows dynamic on-off control of its radio frequency (RF) chains and analog phase shifters (PSs) through a switch network. We also consider a practical and comprehensive power consumption model for the BS, by taking into account the power-dependent non-linear power amplifier (PA) efficiency, and the on-off non-transmission power consumption model of RF chains and PSs. We jointly design the hybrid beamforming and dynamic on-off control at the BS, aiming to minimize its total power consumption, while guaranteeing the performance requirements on communication rates, sensing CramÃ©r-Rao bound (CRB), and harvested power levels. The formulation also takes into consideration the per-antenna transmit power constraint and the constant modulus constraints for the analog beamformer at the BS. The resulting optimization problem for ISCAP is highly non-convex due to the binary on-off non-transmission power consumption of RF chains and PSs, the non-linear PA efficiency, and the coupling between analog and digital beamformers. To tackle this problem, we first approximate the binary on-off non-transmission power consumption into a continuous form, and accordingly propose an iterative algorithm to find a high-quality approximate solution with ensured convergence, by employing techniques from alternating optimization (AO), sequential convex approximation (SCA), and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Then, based on the optimized beamforming weights, we dev...",

        "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has been deemed as a promising communication paradigm to break through the bottleneck of traditional communications. Nonetheless, most of the existing works focus more on point-to-point communication scenarios and its extension to multi-user scenarios is not that straightforward due to its cost-inefficiencies to directly scale the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework to the multi-user communication system. Meanwhile, previous methods optimize the system by differentiable bit-level supervision, easily leading to a âsemantic gapâ. Therefore, we delve into multi-user broadcast communication (BC) based on the universal transformer (UT) and propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based self-critical alternate learning (SCAL) algorithm, named SemanticBC-SCAL, to capably adapt to the different BC channels from one transmitter (TX) to multiple receivers (RXs) for sentence generation task. In particular, to enable stable optimization via a non-differentiable semantic metric, we regard sentence similarity as a reward and formulate this learning process as an RL problem. Considering the huge decision space, we adopt a lightweight but efficient self-critical supervision to guide the learning process. Meanwhile, an alternate learning mechanism is developed to provide cost-effective learning, in which the encoder and decoders are updated asynchronously as independent agents. Notably, the incorporation of RL makes SemanticBC-SCAL compliant with any user-defined semantic similarity metric and simultaneously addresses the channel non-differentiability issue by alternate learning. Besides, the convergence of SemanticBC-SCAL is also theoretically established. Extensive simulation results have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiorness of our approach, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio regions.",

        "abstract": "Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are used for establishing a connection between the human brain and the outside environment, so they are widely used in the brain computer interface (BCI). Nowadays, the imagined speech (IS) is a highly promising paradigm of the BCI. It can be used for controlling the external devices directly. However, the features for performing the IS are unknown. Hence, the numerous features are extracted. As a result, the dimension of the feature vectors is extremely large. To reduce the required computation, the clustering is required to be performed in the low dimensional space. Under this circumstance, the transform matrix affects both the dimensional reduction part and the clustering part. In fact, finding the transform matrix and the clustering centers under this scenario is challenging. To tackle this difficulty, this paper provides a modified joint principal component analysis (PCA) and k means algorithm for performing the IS. Here, the interclass separation among the feature vectors is also taken into an account of the problem formulation. In particular, the problem is formulated as a nonconvex constrained optimization problem. The total two norm reconstruction error of the feature vectors as well as the total two norm differences between the feature vectors and the clustering centers in the low dimensional space and the total two norm differences among the clustering centers are minimized subject to the orthogonality of the transform matrix. The numerical computer simulations are conducted based on the multi-class IS classification database. The obtained results show that our proposed method outperforms the various states of the art methods in terms of the clustering accuracy and the average required execution time. Overall, using the BCI system for performing the imagined speech classification plays an important role in the consumer electronics area.",

        "abstract": "In the control of discrete-event systems for current-state opacity enforcement, it is difficult to synthesize a supervisor by supervisory control theory (SCT) without explicit formal models of the systems. This study utilizes the reinforcement learning (RL) method to obtain supervisory policies for opacity enforcement in the case when the automaton model of the system is unavailable. The state space of the environment in the RL is dynamically generated through system simulation. Actions are defined according to the control patterns of the SCT. A reward function is proposed to evaluate whether the secret is exposed or not. Then, a sequence of state-action-reward chains are obtained as system simulation goes on. The frameworks of Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms are adopted to implement the proposed approach. The goal of the training is to maximize the total accumulative reward by optimizing the action selection in the learning process. Then, an optimal supervisory policy is obtained when the training process converges. Experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions are two aspects. Firstly, a supervisor for opacity enforcement is learned by RL training without an explicit formal model of the system. Secondly, the ability of the proposed method in computing supervisory policies without formal models addresses a significant gap in the literature and offers a new direction for research in opacity enforcement in discrete event systems. Note to Practitioners âSupervisory Control Theory (SCT) supplies an effective way to synthesize supervisors, which traditionally handles tasks with explicit system models for current-state opacity enforcement by restricting behavior of systems. However, formal models of systems are often confidential or otherwise unavailable. This paper presents a method for supervisor synthesis via reinforcement learning in the case of lacking formal models of system...",

However, manually designing suitable SNN architectures needs considerable effort. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective method, Spiking Spatio-Temporal Neural Architecture Search (SSTNAS), for EEG-based emotion recognition. SSTNAS exploits the discriminative spatial and temporal EEG features via Spiking Convolution Neural Network (SCNN) and Spiking Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM), respectively. Then, SSTNAS explores a proper SNN architecture for each task by investigating the spike activation patterns of pre-trained networks based on genetic search, which is free of training. Experimental results on three public benchmark datasets, namely FACED, DEAP and DREAMER, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the related state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Detecting defects in printed labels is essential for quality control. Although a few of vision-based models have been proposed for this challenging task, they fail to deal with the large deformation in printed labels, and can not be generalized well to unseen defects. To this end, we propose a novel Triple-stream Siamese Segmentation Network (TSS-Net) to overcome these issues. TSS-Net utilizes two separate Siamese groups integrated with a registration module to learn differential features based on Siamese similarity comparison, and employs a feature complementary learning strategy, so that the model is able to simultaneously handle large deformations and generalize to unseen defects. Specifically, a pre-trained Registration Module (RM) is integrated into the triple-stream Siamese segmentation network to achieve end-to-end detection, which enhances the robustness to large deformations. Moreover, a group of Differential Feature Enhancement (DFE) modules are constructed to learn differential features at different scales, which forces the network to focus on changed features while ignores invariant features. Further, a feature complementary learning strategy is designed to fuse differential features at different scales, which can suppress artifacts during network reconstruction. Finally, a method is proposed to simulate printed labels with varying degrees of deformation and artificial defects. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed TSS-Net yields the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art method. Specifically, our proposed method achieves improvements of 4.20% on the F 1 score and 7.51% on the Intersection over Union (IoU).",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel Transient Effect Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function for FPGAs. It exploits in an original way the carry chain resources available in modern devices. The basic cell adopted in the proposed architecture can be runtime configured to implement different oscillation paths. This property enables the possibility to output more than one bit response per cell by choosing among the configurations those that exhibit the highest reliability. Such results are achieved by adopting a specific calibration process able to identify configurations of the cells showing the highest stability and the most uncorrelated responses. When implemented on several Series 7 Xilinx devices, no unstable bits were observed at 1 V and 25 $^{\\circ}$ C. Under voltage variation in the manufacturer recommended ranges, a worst case bit error rate of 0.046% is achieved. The circuit designed as here described consists of 64 cells, produces 128 response bits and consumes just 535 look-up-tables and 256 carry chains.",

        "abstract": "Multi-label classification (MLC) refers to the problem of tagging a given instance with a set of relevant labels. Most existing MLC methods are based on the assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is symmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods design learning processes associated with the number of labels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up to large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method named scalable label distribution learning (SLDL) for MLC, which can describe different labels as distributions in a latent space, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension is independent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts labels into continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and leverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different labels. Then, it learns the mapping from the feature space to the latent space, resulting in the computational complexity is no longer related to the number of labels. Finally, SLDL leverages a nearest neighbor-based strategy to decode the latent representations and obtain the final predictions. Extensive experiments illustrate that SLDL achieves very competitive classification performances with little computational consumption.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a novel single-tone-based channel estimation method is proposed for orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) systems. The channel parameters, including the delay taps, Doppler taps, and channel gains, are sequentially estimated in a delay-Doppler domain. Concretely, the delay taps are estimated using a threshold method that provides a constant probability of false alarms (Neyman-Pearson criterion). The integer and fractional Doppler taps and the channel gains of each separable multipath component are obtained using a single-tone parameter estimation method. The estimated parameters are then used to reconstruct the channel matrix. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional low-complexity channel estimation methods in terms of the normalized mean squared error of the channel estimation and the bit error rate (BER) of the communications at the cost of a marginal increase in computational complexity. Further, the BER performance of the proposed method is almost identical to that of perfect channel estimation.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes to estimate the location of an object via computing the regularity of the fractionally integrated signals. The features are extracted from the regularity and the random forest is employed for performing the regression. More precisely, the acquired signal is first denoised via a linear phase filter. Second, the fractional ordered integration of the denoised signal is computed. Here, the fractional orders are chosen as 0.4 and 0.5. Then, the regularity of the fractionally integrated signal is computed. Next, the features related to the location of the objects are extracted. Finally, the random forest is employed for estimating the location of the objects. The computer numerical simulation results indicate that the relative errors of our proposed method are 0.0029, 0.0125 and 0.0125 when the target is placed at distances of 3001m to 3500m, 3501m to 4000m as well as 4001m to 4500m from the acquisition device, respectively. In addition, other indicators such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (Ï), the mean absolute relative distortion (MARD), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean squares error (MSE) and the root MSE (RMSE) yielded by our proposed method are superior to those of existing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The enhancement of underwater images has emerged as a significant technological challenge in advancing marine research and exploration tasks. Due to the scattering of suspended particles and absorption of light in underwater environments, underwater images tend to present blurriness and predominantly color distortion. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing denoising diffusion models to improve underwater degraded images. After training the noise estimation network of the denoising diffusion models, we accelerate the deterministic sampling process with denoising diffusion implicit models. We also propose a patch-based method by implementing average sampling between overlapping image patches at each sampling step, enabling the generation of images at arbitrary resolution while preserving their natural appearance and details. Through benchmark experiments, we illustrate that our method outperforms or closely approaches state-of-the-art techniques in terms of effectiveness and performance. We demonstrate that our approach reduces the interference of underwater environments with the semantic information of the images by salient object detection experiments.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly inheritable neurological disorder, and brain imaging genetics (BIG) has become a rapidly advancing field for comprehensive understanding its pathogenesis. However, most of the existing approaches underestimate the complexity of the interactions among factors that cause AD. To take full appreciate of these complexity interactions, we propose BIGFormer, a graph Transformer with local structural awareness, for AD diagnosis and identification of pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, the factors interaction graph is constructed with lesion brain regions and risk genes as nodes, where the connection between nodes intuitively represents the interaction between nodes. After that, a perception with local structure awareness is built to extract local structure around nodes, which is then injected into node representation. Then, the global reliance inference component assembles the local structure into higher-order structure, and multi-level interaction structures are jointly aggregated into a classification projection head for disease state prediction. Experimental results show that BIGFormer demonstrated superiority in four classification tasks on the AD neuroimaging initiative dataset and proved to identify biomarkers closely intimately related to AD",

        "abstract": "With the acceleration of globalization, the development of the tourism industry increasingly relies on cross-border collaboration, and the digital economy can provide new opportunities for the tourism industry and promote the global application of new tourism productivity. The current research focuses on how to formulate policies and measure their implementation effects, providing important basis for optimizing strategies. Therefore, the joint term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm and potential Dirichlet allocation model are used to analyze policy texts, and the policy consistency index model is introduced to quantitatively evaluate the digital economy policies of the tourism industry. The research results showed that the keywords of tourism industry and platform, promotion service, technology and application appeared together more than 1000 times in policy texts. The depression indices corresponding to policy documents 1 to 8 were 2.944, 2.049, 2.252, 1.269, 2.045, 1.667, 2.142, and 4.118, respectively, with an average depression index of 2.311. In the proportion of depression index results, the policy effect had the highest proportion of 0.5, indicating that it was the most important, while policy guarantee and policy field importance were second, both corresponding to 0.4. In the final analysis, the robustness results at the 95% significance level showed that the advantages and disadvantages of digital economy policies in the tourism industry still had a significant positive effect on the digital transformation of regional enterprises. Therefore, this research method can accurately analyze the implementation effect and internal mechanism of policies, fully utilize big data to provide scientific basis for government decision-makers and business operators, and adjust policy measures in a timely manner.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning has evolved significantly over the last decade, with models capable of robust and accurate predictions over data of various categories. The impact is rather big in the field of Healthcare. However, deployment of small, energy-efficient models remains a goal pursued by researchers across the field. Futhermore, the model inferences are hard to interpret and draw conclusions from, especially in healthcare, where its very important to know how the diagnosis decision was passed and what factors are causing the issues. In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings, where we develop a neuromorphic computing based machine learning model, namely an SNN, and using SHAP, LIME, and eli5 explainability techniques to explain the predictions of the Spiking Neural Network. The proposed SNN performs at an accuracy of 85.06%, better than the deep neural network by 5.73% for the Diabetes dataset and at an accuracy of 97.83% for the Mobile Health dataset, thereby mitigating the issue of both lack of performance-cum-efficiency, as well as uninterpretability of these machine learning models.",

        "abstract": "An undirected weighted graph (UWG) is regularly adopted to portray the interactions among a solo set of nodes from big data-connected applications such as the interactive confidence between proteins in a protein network. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is able to represent a UWG for subsequent pattern analysis tasks such as missing link estimation. However, existing GCNs mostly neglect the local collaborative information hidden in connected node pairs, which leads to severe information loss. To address this issue, this study proposes a node-collaboration-informed graph convolutional network (NGCN) model for implementing the precise UWG representation learning with threefold ideas: 1) extracting the nodesâ global graph characteristics via incorporating the residual connection and weighted representation propagation into the GCN module; 2) learning the nodesâ local collaborative information from the observed interactive node pairs via a symmetric latent factor analysis (SLFA) module; and 3) designing an effective strategy to fuse the nodesâ global graph characteristics and local collaborative information adaptively for highly accurate representation to the target UWG. Its high representation ability to target UWG is proved in theory. Empirical studies on six UWGs generated by real-world applications indicate that owing to its elegant modeling for the node collaborations, the proposed NGCN significantly outperforms several leading-edge models in estimation accuracy to the missing links of a UWG. Its high scalability ensures its compatibility with other GCN extensions, which will be investigated in the future.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the use of motorcycles has witnessed a remarkable surge in urban areas, paralleled by a growing demand for research and development in the motorcycle industry. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices over the last few decades has opened up exciting possibilities, particularly in the realm of data analysis, where motorcycle GPS data has emerged as a valuable resource for various applications. This article presents a novel methodology for estimating the travel duration of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) in heterogeneous traffic using GPS data generated by motorcycles on urban road networks. The proposed methodology has the potential to offer valuable insights into the behavior of PTWs in heterogeneous traffic environments. By analyzing big data generated by GPSbased trajectory data, researchers can identify areas with high motorcycle density and pinpoint potential bottlenecks that impact travel times. Temporal data storing with bearing information in hexagonal shards called âbubblesâ enables researchers to utilize big data more efficiently. Spatial transformation, Kalman filtering, and map-matching of the trajectory data significantly enhance the quality of the data. In this study, the 10-minute interval is performed as optimal for estimating travel time with 4.3% MAPE. Furthermore, combining historical bubble data with a 0.35 scale factor improves MAPE by 9.6%. Despite the limitations, not only is the transferability of this methodology noteworthy, but it is also opening the door to broader applications in diverse urban settings",

        "abstract": "Traditional sideslip angle estimator compensation methods used in line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law are not effective when facing with big amplitude and fluctuating sideslip angle scenarios, resulting in poor path following performance of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). To overcome the drawback, a novel sideslip angle estimator based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed in this article. It integrates the selective updated strategy (SUS) to enhance the learning capability and long-term memory of extremely fluctuating temporal information, thereby meeting the requirement of estimating fluctuating sideslip angle. Based on the proposed SUS-LSTM sideslip angle estimator, a learning line-of-sight (LLOS) guidance law for path following is designed. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the input-to-state stability in probability of the closed-loop cascaded control system, which consists of LLOS and heading controller. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on ASVs and experiments are conducted in the Lingshui bay to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of earth observation technology and UAV technology, utilizing UAVs equipped with various sensors for cross-modal vehicle re-identification has become one of the research hotspots. Cross-modal vehicle re-identification aims to match the same target across multiple non-overlapping camera views in different modalities, enabling monitoring of sensitive targets from day to night. The biggest challenge in cross-modal vehicle re-identification between visible and infrared modalities lies in the differences in imaging principles and spectral bands, leading to significant modality discrepancies. To alleviate these differences, this paper proposes a cross-modal vehicle re-identification network based on modal-cross graph sampling(MCGS) method: 1) A modal-cross graph sampling method is proposed, which can help the subsequent network learn more cross-modal information and reduce the modality differences. 2) A multi-modal shared feature alignment network is designed, which can enhance the representation of shared features across modalities and achieve alignment of features from different modalities. 3) In response to the scarcity of cross-modal vehicle re-identification datasets that combine visible light and infrared modalities, a dataset for cross-modal vehicle re-identification was proposed, named VT-Vehicle. It is collected using a UAV equipped with visible sensors and infrared sensors. In addition, a series of experiments were conducted on the VT-Vehicle dataset and the RGBNT100 dataset. Among them, our method achieved the best Rank-1 accuracy of 82.33% and mAP of 76.16% for visible-to-infrared matching, as well as the best Rank-1 accuracy of 77.37% and mAP of 74.9% for infrared-to-visible matching, indicating the effectiveness and superiority of our method.",

        "abstract": "MRI, a widespread non-invasive medical imaging modality, is highly sensitive to patient motion. Despite many attempts over the years, motion correction remains a difficult problem and there is no general method applicable to all situations. We propose a retrospective method for motion estimation and correction to tackle the problem of in-plane rigid-body motion, apt for classical 2D Spin-Echo scans of the brain, which are regularly used in clinical practice. Due to the sequential acquisition of k-space, motion artifacts are well localized. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks to estimate motion parameters in k-space and uses a model-based approach to restore degraded images to avoid âhallucinationsâ. Notable advantages are its ability to estimate motion occurring in high spatial frequencies without the need of a motion-free reference. The proposed method operates on the whole k-space dynamic range and is moderately affected by the lower SNR of higher harmonics. As a proof of concept, we provide models trained using supervised learning on 600k motion simulations based on motion-free scans of 43 different subjects. Generalization performance was tested with simulations as well as in-vivo. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are presented for motion parameter estimations and image reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach is able to obtain good generalization performance on simulated data and in-vivo acquisitions.

        "abstract": "Internet of vehicles (IoVs) will require massive high data rate connections with the base station (BS) to provide promising vehicular entertainment services, such as autonomous driving and traffic management. However, vehicles often encounter obstruction from buildings while traveling in urban areas, resulting in blocked direct links between the BS and the vehicle, thereby impacting the channel quality of vehicular links. To enhance the channel capacity of the IoV, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology is introduced to assist vehicular networking scenarios in improving the signal propagation environment. Firstly, considering the maximum transmit power budget of the BS and the phase shift constraints of the RIS, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the channel capacity of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links by jointly designing the active beamforming at the BS and the passive beamforming matrix at the RIS. Then, we propose a RIS-assisted unsupervised beamforming (RAUB) algorithm with a two-phase transformer network architecture to design the active beamforming and the reflection phase shift. By utilizing the global feature extraction ability of the transformer network model in the two-phase network architecture, the learning performance of the network is further improved. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the traditional block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on alternating iterative optimization, the proposed RAUB algorithm can achieve comparable performance for the sum V2I capacity with lower computational complexity and better convergence performance.",

        "abstract": "Cyber-physical social systems (CPSS) have developed significantly in the last decade as a result of their effective computing and communication capabilities. Security and safety concerns, yet continue to be the biggest obstacle to the wider acceptance of CPSS in spite of all technological developments. In this work, we investigate the problem of secure localization of roaming users along with preserving their privacy in CPSS through location information fusion. We present a novel idea of privacy preserving location information fusion based on linear combination aggregation and extend it for its use in CPSS ensuring the privacy of anchorâs locations and dimensions, and targetâs location while roaming in CPSS environment. Furthermore, a privacy-preserving secure localization scheme is offered, together with the necessary cryptographic support to ensure the ultimate aim of privacy. In CPSS contexts where real-time location information is crucial for participantâs safety, the proposed privacy-preserving secure localization scheme can be implemented. The proposed scheme is assessed through the implementation of a trustworthy personalized consumer recommendation system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can guarantee high recommendation accuracy and achieve the accuracy and diversity of personalized recommendations under varying recommendation list lengths when compared to other reliable methods for personalized consumer recommendations.",

        "abstract": "In a massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenario, there are large number of devices that may establish links to receivers, which causes a great burden to the system for signaling overhead, thereby reducing the communication efficiency. One potential approach involves refraining from assigning signaling overhead to users, with active users opportunistically transmitting data messages within time slots. The receiver only needs to recover these independent data messages without identifying the source of these messages, named unsourced random access (URA). In this paper, suitable URA schemes are proposed for cellular massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and cell-free massive MIMO systems. In the cellular scenario, the system completes the transmission and estimation of the number of active users and the corresponding channel large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs) in stage one. Utilizing the channel information obtained in stage one, the receiver in stage two applies the sparse-correction-based bilinear generalized approximate message passing (SCB-BiG-AMP) algorithm proposed in this paper to restore the original data sequences sent by active users. In a cell-free scenario, active users won't transmit LSFC information similar to that in stage one of cellular scenario for the properties of massive distributed antennas. Instead, the central limit theorem (CLT) is used to estimate the average channel LSFC of all active users, which is substituted into the SCB-BiG-AMP algorithm as the equivalent channel variance. Then, the original data sequences sent by active users can be restored. According to the simulation results, the proposed URA communication scheme can achieve good bit error performance. Moreover, as a result of the small uplink user-AP distance, the system performance in the cell-free scenario is much better than that in the cellular scenario.",

        "abstract": "Beam management is an important technique to improve signal strength and reduce interference in wireless communication systems. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using diverse sensing modalities for beam management. However, it remains a big challenge to process multi-modal data efficiently and extract useful information. On the other hand, the recently emerging multi-modal transformer (MMT) is a promising technique that can process multi-modal data by capturing long-range dependencies. While MMT is highly effective in handling multi-modal data and providing robust beam management, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their adaptability in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a two-step beam management method by combining MMT with RL for dynamic beam index prediction. In the first step, we divide available beam indices into several groups and leverage MMT to process diverse data modalities to predict the optimal beam group. In the second step, we employ RL for fast beam decision-making within each group, which in return maximizes throughput. Our proposed framework is tested on a 6G dataset. In this testing scenario, it achieves higher beam prediction accuracy and system throughput compared to both the MMT-only based method and the RL-only based method.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been enabled by sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication and artificial intelligence technologies. However, with the explosive growth of vehicle big data. However, big data transmission consumes a significant amount of energy. Green IoV networks have received increasing attention. Power consumption optimization plays an important role in green IoV networks. Using decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, we investigate the intelligent power allocation optimization of green cooperative IoV networks. Based on the characteristics of mobile channels, we employ outage probability (OP) criterion to analyze communication performance of green cooperative connected IoV networks from a mathematical perspective. Novel OP mathematical expressions are obtained. Using the obtained OP results, we investigate the problem of OP performance minimization via power allocation optimization. The complex non-convex problem of power allocation is formulated, as well as the optimization function. Based on the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), an intelligent optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the above complex problem. The proposed SSA approach is compared to the state-of-the-art intelligence algorithms, and our proposed algorithm can achieve a shorter running time and a good OP performance, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Joint chance constraint (JCC) can ensure the consistency and correlation of stochastic variables when participating in decision-making. Sample average approximation (SAA) is the most popular approach for solving JCCs in unit commitment (UC) problems. However, the typical SAA requires large Monte Carlo (MC)-samples to ensure the solving accuracy, which results in large-scale mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. To address this problem, this paper presents partial sample average approximation (PSAA) to deal with JCCs in multiarea power systems with wind power (MAS-WP) UC problems. PSAA partitions the stochastic variable and history data set, the history data set is partitioned into the not-sampled set and sampled set. When approximating the expectation of stochastic variables, PSAA replaces the big-M formulation with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the not-sampled set, thus avoiding introducing binary variables. Finally, PSAA can realize the chance constraints to deterministic constraints with only continuous variables, avoiding the large-scale MIP problem caused by SAA. Simulation results demonstrate that PSAA has significant advantages in solving accuracy and efficiency than other existing methods, including traditional SAA, SAA with improved big-M method, SAA with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and multistage robust optimization (MSRO) method.",

        "abstract": "Detecting precisely any incipient fault is of critical importance for a mechatronic system, which may improve its safety, availability, and maintainability. However, high dimensionality and data imbalance are big obstacles for establishing an effective fault detection model. In this article, an interpretable fault detection model is proposed by designing a causal-based graph convolution network (GCN). First, the biased data distribution of imbalanced monitoring data is adjusted according to prior knowledge, to obtain a more trustable causal network. Second, average causal effects (ACEs) are calculated according to the obtained causal network to quantitatively describe the causal relations. Finally, a directed weighted GCN (DWGCN) is designed for the causal network with ACEs to build the fault detection model. Spectral clustering and graph coarsening methods for directed graphs are integrated in DWGCN. And, to improve the modeling efficiency, the model structure parameters are carefully designed. Based on both simulation data and real data, the proposed priori-constrained causal discovery has been proven to be able to mine causal networks that meet more than 50% of prior-constraints. And, based on real data, the average F- measure and G-mean of the DWGCN reach 84.7% and 85.3%, which is superior to the conventional GCNs and machine learning methods.",

        "abstract": "Transportation systems often use agent-to-agent communication technologies to enhance control performance by transmitting information across wireless networks to keep a reasonable inter-distance between agents. The agent-to-agent data transmission is influenced by the fading channel and the limited communication bandwidth. Denial of Service attack model is used to describe the attackâs influence on control system. Thus, the communication model is built as Bernoulli distribution, Markovian distribution and so on. But in practical situations, it is more complicated than we imagine. To further push the theoretical results to practical situations, we investigate the jamming attack with non-stationary stochastic process in the leader-follower systems and introduce hidden Markovian distribution model (HMM) to describe this special jamming attack. Furthermore, the controller design method is presented to achieve stochastic stability of the leader-follower system. The structure of the control algorithm is a special MPC method, which is divided into a state feedback part and a modification part. The state feedback part is a typical LMIs controller to guarantee the systemâs stability, while the modification part is used to improve the influence of the model mismatch and uncertainty. The highlights of the results are the following two points. Firstly, the more complex and precise transportation system model is founded by the hidden Markovian distribution. Secondly, the controller design method is also presented for the multi-agent systems with this HMM transportation system model. The existing results always find the worst case scenario, and design the controller in this scenario. Usually, the controller is very conservative and even unstable. The results in this paper can change the controller in different scenarios to adapt to the corresponding jamming stochastic distribution model, which is the novelty of this paper. We use two examples to illustrate the proposed results. T...",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a high efficient 3D convolution feature compression method is proposed. This method is mainly used to compress the three-dimensional convolution deep features extracted by video analysis. Gather the compressed features to the cloud server instead of all video features. This method can solve the problem that the data aggregation of video big data analysis requires a large amount of network bandwidth. Quantization is a common method for feature compression, but the existing quantization-based methods often carry out model training and quantization in stages, which makes the robustness of quantization results poor. To solve this problem, the method proposed in this paper is to apply the feature quantization operation directly to the network and train it with the analysis task, and use the parameter iterative optimization method to solve the non-differentiable problem of quantization operation. Different from the deep features extracted from images or single objects, the 3D convolution features extracted from video clips have high time-domain redundancy. In this paper, by serializing the three-dimensional convolution features, the time-domain prediction coding method is used to remove the time-domain redundancy of the three-dimensional convolution features, to improve the feature compression ratio. The experimental results show that this method can only use 1 bit to represent the elements in the three-dimensional convolution deep feature. When the analysis accuracy loss is no more than 1%, the feature compression ratio can reach 4500 times compared with the original feature data, and the data transmission can be reduced by 96%.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a developing technology and its range of applications is satisfying among numerous consumers, as it makes everything very simple. As a concern of its huge evolution, privacy, and security are vital problems where IoT devices are always susceptible to cyberattacks. To overcome this problem, mitigation and intrusion detection are achieved which improves the safety of IoT networks. Recently, the technology of blockchain (BC) has developed as a strength for IoT-based application growth. The BC is mainly operated to resolve single-point failure (third-part dependence), security, and privacy problems of IoT applications. The combination of BC using IoT is an advantage for both society and individuals. However, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on extracting pool discovered the crucial mistake line between BC-permitted networks of IoT. Besides, this use makes vast data quantities. Machine Learning (ML) provides broad sovereignty in the study of big data, and abilities of decision making and so it is employed as a critical device. Therefore, this study develops a Metaheuristic Approach to Detecting and Mitigating Attacks in the Blockchain-Integrated Deep Learning (MHADMA-BCIDL) model. The designed MHADMA-BCIDL approachâs main goal is to classify and detect DDoS attacks and accomplish security in the IoT Application. To obtain this, the MHADMA-BCIDL method utilizes BC technologies to facilitate secured communication in networks of IoT, reinforcing security through decentralized and immutable data storage. For the feature selection process, the arctic tern optimization (ATO) technique is employed to decrease the data dimensionality while conserving the most relevant attributes. Besides, the MHADMA-BCIDL technique employs an attention-based convolutional neural network with bi-directional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM-Attention) method for the detection and classification of attacks. For parameter tuning, the walrus optimizer (W...",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the emergence of big data. Processing this data, specially in learning algorithms, poses a challenge for current embedded computing systems. Brain-inspired hyperdimensional (HD) computing reduces several complex learning operations to simpler bitwise and arithmetic operations. However, it requires the use of large dimensional vectors, hypervectors, further increasing the amount of data to be processed. Processing in-memory (PIM) enables in-place computation which reduces data movement, a major latency bottleneck in conventional systems. In this paper, we propose, an in-memory HD computing architecture that performs HD classification in memory. To the best of authorsâ knowledge, is the first ReRAM PIM architecture to implement the complete HD computing-based classification pipeline including encoding, training, re-training, and inference for non-binary data. We also propose a novel distance metric that is PIM-friendly and provides similar application accuracy as the more complex baseline metric. Our proposed architecture is enabled in PIM by fast and energy-efficient in-memory logic operations. We exploit the voltage threshold-based memristors to enable single cycle operations. We also increase the amount of in-memory parallelism in our design by segmenting bitlines using switches. Our evaluation shows that for all applications tested using HD, provides on average 434Ã (2170Ã) speedup and consumes 4114Ã (26019Ã) less energy as compared to the CPU while running end-to-end HD training (inference). also achieves at least 2.2% higher classification accuracy than the existing PIM-based HD designs.",

        "abstract": "The manufacturing industry is facing increasing challenges to improve sustainability performance by using Industry 4.0 technologies like big data analytics, the internet of things, digital twins considering their potentials. However, effectively integrating sustainability goals and Industry 4.0 technologies within manufacturing systems can be challenging due to real time attribute data of digital twins of machinery obtained by IoT tools and necessity to integrate them into production planning levels. This challenge can be addressed by developing a framework for optimizing the flow of operations in a manufacturing system while incorporating sustainability assessment and Industry 4.0 technologies effectively. This paper investigates the integration of sustainability assessment considering Industry 4.0 technologies and the use of Markov Decision Process capabilities. The framework utilizes Markov Decision Process to model the decision-making process of the manufacturing system and its decision-makers. It includes sustainability goals as constraints or objectives in the Markov Decision Process model. The use of Industry 4.0 technologies is integrated into the framework to gather data and optimize the decision-making process based on that data. The capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated through case studies of a single agent on a shop floor. The findings from the case study indicate that the proposed framework can effectively support decision-making at the top-tier level of the enterprise by integrating sustainability assessment and the Industry 4.0 paradigm.",

        "abstract": "As a prevalent computing paradigm, graph computing provides an effective service strategy for the analysis of big data within the Internet of Everything (IoE), particularly for clustering graph-structured data in the IoE. Among various methods, graph contrastive clustering, which is devoted to revealing the intrinsic structure of graphs and efficiently grouping nodes into distinct clusters by contrasting positive-negative counterparts, has attracted widely attention in recent years. However, the existing methods seriously ignore the graph topology and node attributes when setting positive and negative sample pairs, which further leads to node semantic inconsistency. To this end, we design a novel tensor representation based multi-view contrastive graph representation learning framework including adaptive data augmentation, high-confidence sample pairs construction, and a simple yet effective self-optimizing module guided by clustering objective function, to address issues of graph contrastive learning in ignoring complementary information among the topology and attributes. Specifically, by jointly modeling the graph structure and multi-view node attributes, the new proposed clustering model can concurrently mine both hard positive and negative samples, and dynamically enhance the weight allocation of the hard samples during the learning process. Then leveraging the characteristics of graph-structured data, we incorporate a small subset of nodes with the highest similarity as additional positive samples to improve the discriminative power of the proposed model. Furthermore, a self-optimizing clustering module is introduced to enhance the algorithmâs performance. Experimental results on four commonly used IoE-related datasets validate that our proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art clustering performance.",

        "abstract": "The secure sharing of data is crucial for peer-to-peer energy trading. However, the vulnerability of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures to cyberattacks, e.g., Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, poses a significant challenge. A possible solution is to use Digital Twin (DT) modeling of the physical system, which provides robust digital mapping and Big Data processing capabilities that facilitate data recovery. To this end, this paper proposes a DT-enabled energy trading framework for cyber-physical energy systems that offers data analytic and recovery capabilities to defend from DoS attacks. With this framework, a new distributed approximate-newton trading algorithm with a switched triggering control strategy is proposed. Therein, the DT model is employed to achieve data recovery and adjust the system evolution of trading trajectory during attack periods. This enables the proposed method to find optimal trading solutions even in the presence of DoS attacks. Theoretical analysis results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method. Furthermore, numerical simulations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Personality trait recognition is an important psychological paradigm to understand the differences in peopleâs behavior. This paper presents a new dataset, which we dubbed as PROPER (Personality Recognition based On Public Speaking using Electroencephalography Recordings) that connects the personality traits of an individual with public speaking activity via electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG data of 40 healthy individuals is recorded before, during, and after public speaking activity using Muse headband. A score from the Big Five Personality Trait questionnaire is used to label the participantâs EEG data. A statistical analysis of EEG signals for each personality trait during different phases of the experiment is performed. The personality recognition process involves data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification. Five feature groups are extracted from the frequency bands of EEG data of each channel. Feature selection is applied to the extracted features via the wrapper method. Support vector machine, the Naive Bayes, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are used to classify the personality traits. An average F1-score of 0.95 for extroversion, 0.94 for openness to experience, 0.90 for conscientiousness, 0.84 for neuroticism, and 0.85 for agreeableness is achieved using the MLP classifier using pre-stimulus, during activity, and post-stimulus EEG data respectively.",

        "abstract": "Accurate target segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans is crucial for surgical robots to perform clinical surgeries successfully. However, the lack of medical image data and annotations has been the biggest obstacle to learning robust medical image segmentation models. Self-supervised learning can effectively address this problem by providing a strategy to pre-train a model with unlabeled data, and then fine-tune downstream tasks with limited labeled data. Existing self-supervised methods fail to simultaneously utilize the abundant global anatomical structure information and local feature differences in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a new strategy for the pre-training framework, which uses the three-dimensional anatomical structure of medical images and specific task and background cues to segment volumetric medical images with limited annotations. Specifically, we propose (1) learning intrinsic patterns of volumetric medical image structures through multiple sub-tasks, and (2) designing a multi-level background cube contrastive learning strategy to enhance the target feature representation by exploiting the differences between the specific target and background. We conduct extensive evaluations on two publicly available datasets. Under limited annotation settings, the proposed method yields significant improvements compared to other self-supervised learning techniques. The proposed method achieves within 6% of the baseline performance using only five labeled CT volumes for training.

        "abstract": "The application of computer vision-powered large language models (LLMs) for medical image diagnosis has significantly advanced healthcare systems. Recent progress in developing symmetrical architectures has greatly impacted various medical imaging tasks. While CNNs or RNNs have demonstrated excellent performance, these architectures often face notable limitations of substantial losses in detailed information, such as requiring to capture global semantic information effectively and relying heavily on deep encoders and aggressive downsampling. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based Hybrid-Transformer Network (HybridTransNet) designed to encode tokenized Big Data patches with the transformer mechanism, which elegantly embeds multimodal data of varying sizes as token sequence inputs of LLMS. Subsequently, the network performs both inter-scale and intra-scale self-attention, processing data features through a transformer-based symmetric architecture with a refining module, which facilitates accurately recovering both local and global context information. Additionally, the output is refined using a novel fuzzy selector. Compared to other existing methods on two distinct datasets, the experimental findings and formal assessment demonstrate that our LLM-based HybridTransNet provides superior performance for brain tumor diagnosis in healthcare informatics.",

        "abstract": "The development of molecular imaging algorithms and tools has advanced our understanding of the molecular dynamics in complex systems, such as tracking cells in vivo. One of these advancements, the positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) algorithm, allows particles to be tracked through a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The spatiotemporal B-spline reconstruction (SBSR) method of the PEPT algorithm is capable of tracking a single particle, such as a cell using PET with high accuracy. However, its slow computational speed, particularly with large data, results in time-intensive hyperparameter tuning, which is a limitation in real-world applications. This study introduces a novel approach, employing the backpropagation algorithm, commonly used in deep learning, to enhance the efficiency of gradient computation during particle trajectory reconstruction. Comparisons of the computational speed of the previous and current algorithms on a PEPT benchmark dataset show that the novel approach significantly increased the computational speed without compromising the tracking accuracy. Notably, we found that the difference in computation time between the current and previous algorithms increased as the size of the data increased. In conclusion, we have improved the SBSR method by efficiently computing the gradients, making it faster and more efficient. Even with bigger data, our approach keeps up, showing an improvement in computational speed.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is a powerful technique for datadriven learning in the era of big data. However, most deep learning models are deterministic models that ignore the uncertainty of data. Fuzzy neural networks are proposed to tackle this type of problem. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN). Different from classical fuzzy neural networks, QA-HFNN uses quantum neural networks (QNNs) to learn fuzzy membership functions. The model is a multi-feature fusion learning algorithm with a parallel structural design that integrates quantum and classical neural networks. The classical network is used to capture highdimensional neural features, the QNNs are designed to capture fuzzy logic features of the data, then the two features are fused to form the final features to be classified. The experiment is performed on a classical computer, and the quantum circuit is built through a simulated quantum environment. The results indicate that QA-HFNN can equal or even surpass classical methods in accuracy for image classification tasks. The quantum circuit utilizes only a single qubit which is easy to implement. In addition, the fidelity of quantum circuit in a quantum noise environment is assessed, demonstrating that QA-HFNN has strong robustness. The time and computational complexity of QNNs is analyzed, further proving the effectiveness of the model",

        "abstract": "SSD-based in-storage computing (called âSmart SSDsâ) allows application-specific codes to execute inside SSDs to exploit the high internal bandwidth and energy-efficient processors. As a result, Smart SSDs have been successfully deployed in many industry settings, e.g., Samsung, IBM, Teradata, and Oracle. Moreover, researchers have also demonstrated their potential opportunities in database systems, data mining, and big data processing. However, it remains unknown whether search engine systems can benefit from Smart SSDs. This work takes a first step to answer this question. The major research issue is what search engine query processing operations can be cost-effectively offloaded to SSDs. For this, we carefully identified the five most commonly used search engine operations that could potentially benefit from Smart SSDs: intersection, ranked intersection, ranked union, difference, and ranked difference. With close collaboration with Samsung, we offloaded the above five operations of Apache Lucene (a widely used open-source search engine) to Samsungs Smart SSD. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the system performance and tradeoffs by using both synthetic datasets and real datasets. The experimental results show that Smart SSDs significantly reduce the query latency by a factor of 2-3 and energy consumption by 6-10 for most of the aforementioned operations.",

        "abstract": "The technology of speech emotion recognition (SER) has been widely applied in the field of human-computer interaction within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The incorporation of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data has accelerated the advancement of SER technology. However, this reveals challenges such as limited computational resources, data processing inefficiency, and security and privacy concerns. In recent years, quantum machine learning has been applied to the field of intelligent transportation, which has demonstrated its various advantages, including high prediction accuracy, robust noise resistance, and strong security. This study first integrates quantum federated learning (QFL) into 5G IoV using a quantum minimal gated unit (QMGU) recurrent neural network for local training. Then, it proposes a novel quantum federated learning algorithm, QFSM, to further enhance computational efficiency and privacy protection. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms using quantum long short-term memory network or quantum gated recurrent unit models, the QFSM algorithm has a higher recognition accuracy and faster training convergence rate. It also performs better in terms of privacy protection and noise robustness, enhancing its applicability and practicality.",

        "abstract": "The evolving unknown cyberattacks, compounded by the widespread emerging technologies (say 5G, Internet of Things, etc.), have rapidly expanded the cyber threat landscape. However, most existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are effective in detecting only known cyberattacks, because only known cyberattack samples are usually available for IDS training. Identifying unknown cyberattacks, therefore, remains a big challenging issue. To meet this gap, in this paper, motivated by artificial immunity (AIm) and differential evolution (DE), we propose a bidirectional differential evolution based unknown cyberattack detection system, coined BDE-IDS. Specifically, we first design a bidirectional differential evolution algorithm for known nonself antigens (abnormal data), where bidirectional evolutionary directions are considered for increasing or decreasing the differences between known nonself antigens and self antigens (normal data), to create new antigens possibly used for generating cyberattack detectors. Second, a novel tolerance training mechanism is developed to eliminate invalid newly-evolved antigens falling into the coverage of either known self or nonself antigens. Third, the remaining antigens are employed to generate detectors for unknown cyberattacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDE-IDS achieves outperformance in detecting unknown cyberattacks (as well as known cyberattacks) compared to state-of-the-art studies, including those AIm-based, signature-based, and anomaly-based IDSs.",

        "abstract": "Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenses account for up to 30% of the operating costs of wind farms. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategies, which incorporate predictive analytics into maintenance optimization, have been proven to be effective in reducing O&M costs in wind farms. Existing predictive CBM strategies for wind farms rely on the assumption that predictive analytics can accurately estimate the remaining lifetime distribution (RLD) of wind turbines, allowing for the direct implementation of stochastic programming or threshold-based policies. However, estimated RLDs can be inaccurate due to noisy sensors or limited training data. To address this issue, this paper develops a CBM strategy for wind farms that uses a Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained (DRCC) optimization model. Our formulation acknowledges that estimated distributions may be inaccurate and so seeks solutions that are robust against distribution perturbations within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We show that the proposed DRCC optimization problem can be exactly reformulated as an integer linear program. We derive methods to strengthen the Big-M values of this reformulation, thereby enabling the DRCC model to be efficiently solved by off-the-shelf optimization software. The proposed strategy is validated through computational studies using real-world and synthetic degradation data, outperforming stochastic programming and robust optimization benchmark models.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of Big Data, managing large-scale portfolios of thousands of securities is one of the most challenging tasks in the asset management industry. This study uses an evolutionary multi-objective technique to solve large-scale portfolio optimisation problems with both long-term listed and newly listed securities. The future returns of long-term listed securities are defined as random variables whose probability distributions are estimated based on sufficient historical data, while the returns of newly listed securities are defined as uncertain variables whose uncertainty distributions are estimated based on expertsâ knowledge. Our approach defines security returns as theoretically uncertain random variables and proposes a three-moment optimisation model with practical trading constraints. In this study, a framework for applying arbitrary multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to portfolio optimisation is established, and a novel evolutionary algorithm based on large-scale optimisation techniques is developed to solve the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in large-scale portfolio optimisation.",

        "abstract": "Most existing few-shot image classification methods employ global pooling to aggregate class-relevant local features in a data-drive manner. Due to the difficulty and inaccuracy in locating class-relevant regions in complex scenarios, as well as the large semantic diversity of local features, the class-irrelevant information could reduce the robustness of the representations obtained by performing global pooling. Meanwhile, the scarcity of labeled images exacerbates the difficulties of data-hungry deep models in identifying class-relevant regions. These issues severely limit deep modelsâ few-shot learning ability. In this work, we propose to remove the class-irrelevant information by making local features class relevant, thus bypassing the big challenge of identifying which local features are class irrelevant. The resulting class-irrelevant feature removal (CIFR) method consists of three phases. First, we employ the masked image modeling strategy to build an understanding of imagesâ internal structures that generalizes well. Second, we design a semantic-complementary feature propagation module to make local features class relevant. Third, we introduce a weighted dense-connected similarity measure, based on which a loss function is raised to fine-tune the entire pipeline, with the aim of further enhancing the semantic consistency of the class-relevant local features. Visualization results show that CIFR achieves the removal of class-irrelevant information by making local features related to classes. Comparison results on four benchmark datasets indicate that CIFR yields very promising performance.",

        "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in sensor network research is developing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with energy efficiency constraints. Making an energy aware WSN assures prolonged working of network system by increasing its lifespan and by decreasing the overall maintenance costs. Uncertainties also result from unclear information flow via routing protocols, conflicting data scheduling, assigning tasks to different nodes, etc. As a result, we offer a hybrid methodology in this work that uses a Pythagorean fuzzy set to rank the various WSN systems while taking into account their various energy-affecting properties. We also develop a novel exponential entropy metric, which we will employ to determine the different attribute weights. Additionally, we provide the equation that embeds another attitude character component in order to aggregate the various data points. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with a case study on energy-efficient WSNs. The algorithmâs reach is demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis and comparison with the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "This work describes the hardware implementation of a cryptographic accelerators suite, named Crypto-Tile, in the framework of the European Processor Initiative (EPI) project. The EPI project traced the roadmap to develop the first family of low-power processors with the design fully made in Europe, for Big Data, supercomputers and automotive. Each of the coprocessors of Crypto-Tile is dedicated to a specific family of cryptographic algorithms, offering functions for symmetric and public-key cryptography, computation of digests, generation of random numbers, and Post-Quantum cryptography. The performances of each coprocessor outperform other available solutions, offering innovative hardware-native services, such as key management, clock randomisation and access privilege mechanisms. The system has been synthesised on a 7 nm standard-cell technology, being the first Cryptoprocessor to be characterised in such an advanced silicon technology. The post-synthesis netlist has been employed to assess the resistance of Crypto-Tile to power analysis side-channel attacks. Finally, a demoboard has been implemented, integrating a RISC-V softcore processor and the Crypto-Tile module, and drivers for hardware abstraction layer, bare-metal applications and drivers for Linux kernel in C language have been developed. Finally, we exploited them to compare in terms of execution speed the hardware-accelerated algorithms against software-only solutions.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, with the improvement of national income levels, people's consumption concept has begun to transition from enjoyment to quality, and people pay more and more attention to food safety and health. The research of intelligent brand image recognition technology is the most important to prevent the spread of counterfeit and shoddy products and brand cultivation. This article mainly studies the cultivation method of consumer marketing brand based on image recognition technology. This article is based on image recognition technology. Consumers can obtain relevant information and brand culture through the mobile phone camera function anytime, anywhere, establish a bridge between consumers and company brands, broaden the company's channels for obtaining consumer information big data, and deeply tap consumer potential. Demand, further enrich the brand cultivation methods, and achieve a new terminal service experience of \"efficient, convenient and satisfactory\" for consumers. In the experiment of this paper, the shape of the product packaging is relatively irregular, so there are fewer feature points generated in this part, which leads to the inaccurate extraction and distribution of visual words, which reduces the accuracy of single product extraction slightly, but the overall result is good. The maximum number of iterations in this experiment is 40, which can meet the requirements of most pictures. From the perspective of consumer perception, this paper explores and proposes a new path for consumer marketing brand cultivation of image recognition technology, promotes the deep integration of new artificial intelligence technology and brand industry, and fills the gaps in industry-related technologies and applications.",

IIN services rely on geolocation databases that store indoor models comprising of floor-maps and points-of-interest along with wireless, light and magnetic signals used to localize users. Developing IIN services creates a new spectrum of information management challenges ranging from crowdsourcing indoor models, acquiring and fusing big-data velocity signals, localization algorithms, location privacy of custodians and others. In this work, we present the current landscape of academic and industrial IIN services using a multi-dimensional taxonomy of emerging topics in this domain, including location, crowdsourcing, privacy and modeling. We present the dimensions of our taxonomy through the lens of an open, modular, extensible and scalable IIN architecture, coined Anyplace, concluding with open challenges.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents MOCAS , a multimodal dataset dedicated for human cognitive workload (CWL) assessment. In contrast to existing datasets based on virtual game stimuli, the data in MOCAS was collected from realistic closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring tasks, increasing its applicability for real-world scenarios. To build MOCAS , two off-the-shelf wearable sensors and one webcam were utilized to collect physiological signals and behavioral features from 21 human subjects. After each task, participants reported their CWL by completing the NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and Instantaneous Self-Assessment (ISA). Personal background (e.g., personality and prior experience) was surveyed using demographic and Big Five Factor personality questionnaires, and two domains of subjective emotion information (i.e., arousal and valence) were obtained from the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), which could serve as potential indicators for improving CWL recognition performance. Technical validation was conducted to demonstrate that target CWL levels were elicited during simultaneous CCTV monitoring tasks; its results support the high quality of the collected multimodal signals.",

        "abstract": "The advances of smartphone technology in recent years is leading to the uptake of a new class of Internet-based Indoor Navigation (IIN) services, which might soon diminish the need of Satellite-based technologies in urban environments. IIN services rely on geolocation databases that store indoor models comprising of floor-maps and points-of-interest along with wireless, light and magnetic signals used to localize users. Developing IIN services creates a new spectrum of information management challenges ranging from crowdsourcing indoor models, acquiring and fusing big-data velocity signals, localization algorithms, location privacy of custodians and others. In this work, we present the current landscape of academic and industrial IIN services using a multi-dimensional taxonomy of emerging topics in this domain, including location, crowdsourcing, privacy and modeling. We present the dimensions of our taxonomy through the lens of an open, modular, extensible and scalable IIN architecture, coined Anyplace, concluding with open challenges.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a Fragmented Hybrid Cloud (FHC) that provides a unified view of multiple geographically distributed private cloud datacenters. FHC leverages a fragmented usage model in which outsourcing is bi-directional across private clouds that can be hosted by static and mobile entities. The mobility aspect of private cloud nodes has important impacts on the FHC performance in terms of latency and network throughput that are reversely proportional to time-varying distances among different nodes. Mobility also results in intermittent interruption among computing nodes and network links of FHC infrastructure. To fully consider mobility and its consequences, we implemented a layered FHC that leverages Linux utilities and bash-shell programming. We also evaluated the impact of the mobility of nodes on the performance of distributed databases as a result of time-varying latency and bandwidth, downsizing and upsizing cluster nodes, and network accessibility. The findings from our extensive experiments provide deep insights into the performance of well-known big data databases, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, and MySQL, when deployed on a FHC.",

        "abstract": "To reduce the fuel consumption of heavy duty logistic vehicles (HDLVs), P2 parallel hybridization is a promising solution, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising method to optimize energy management strategies (EMSs). However, the complicated discrete-continuous hybrid action space lying in the P2 system presents a challenge to achieve real-time optimal control. Thus, this paper proposes a novel DRL algorithm combining auto-tune soft actor-critic (ATSAC) with ordinal regression to optimize the engine torque output and gear shifting simultaneously. ATSAC can adjust the update frequency and learning rate of SAC automatically to improve the generalization and ordinal regression can convert discrete variables into samplings in continuous space to handle the hybrid action. Moreover, a multi-dimensional scenario-oriented driving cycle (SODC) is established through naturalistic driving big data (NDBD) as the training cycle to further improve the EMS generalization. By comprehensive comparison with the widely used twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based EMSs, ATSAC achieves significant improvement with 53.70% higher computational efficiency and 12.31% lower negative total reward (NTR) in the training process. Application analysis in unseen real-world driving scenarios shows that only ATSAC based EMS can obtain real-time optimal control in the testing process. Furthermore, the EMS trained through SODC obtains 81.73% lower NTR than the standard China World Transient Vehicle Cycle (CWTVC) which demonstrates that SODC can represent the real-world driving scenarios much more accurately than CWTVC, especially in low-speed high-load conditions which are crucial for HDLVs.",

        "abstract": "Optimal Transport (OT) is a mathematical framework that first emerged in the eighteenth century and has led to a plethora of methods for answering many theoretical and applied questions. The last decade has been a witness to the remarkable contributions of this classical optimization problem to machine learning. This paper is about where and how optimal transport is used in machine learning with a focus on the question of scalable optimal transport. We provide a comprehensive survey of optimal transport while ensuring an accessible presentation as permitted by the nature of the topic and the context. First, we explain the optimal transport background and introduce different flavors (i.e. mathematical formulations), properties, and notable applications. We then address the fundamental question of how to scale optimal transport to cope with the current demands of big and high dimensional data. We conduct a systematic analysis of the methods used in the literature for scaling OT and present the findings in a unified taxonomy. We conclude with presenting some open challenges and discussing potential future research directions. A live repository of related OT research papers is maintained in https://github.com/abdelwahed/OT_for_big_data.git",

        "abstract": "Although Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been around for over five decades, its integration with Big Data generated by IoT networks has raised research interest. This fusion enables the Digital Twin of a Building (DTB), a real-time virtual replica facilitating efficient location-based services, precise monitoring, and enhanced operational efficiency. Despite its alignment with the Smart City paradigm, widespread adoption is hindered by the initial investment for IoT network deployment. This article presents a comprehensive process, from optimizing IoT network deployment to implementing robust location-based services. A genetic algorithm leveraging the BIM database improves coverage by 44% compared to random deployments, while a multi-tier architecture based on deployed and roaming usersâ devices extends service availability to 80% of devices without internet access, enhancing overall service quality by â¼200%. Eventually, the versatility of DTB is showcased through the use case of indoor guidance services, concluding with potential research directions using the DTB.",

        "abstract": "A low-complexity digital interpolator-free clock recovery architecture with analog and digital coprocessing is proposed. Wide-range sampling clock offset is captured by using timing phase error spectrum analysis at open-loop low-speed operation mode, and the accurate tracking of high-speed sampling clock frequency and phase is achieved by adjusting the reference clock source of ADCs with a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) module in a feedback closed-loop operation. The feasibility and the stability of the clock recovery scheme are verified in a 10-Gbps data rate PM-QPSK modulation field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based homodyne coherent receiver with a commercial DDS chip. Compared with the traditional all-digital scheme with linear and Lagrange interpolators, the receiver sensitivity of the proposed scheme at BER of 1Ã10 -3 improves 1.5 and 0.4 dB due to the absence of ripple and lowpass effect introduced by digital interpolator, and the utilization of ALMs, logic register, and hardware multiplier is reduced by 79%, 81%, 83% and 81%, 84%, 92%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed coprocessing method is further validated and compared in an adaptive equalization and clock recovery joint scheme. The biggest contribution of this work is the clever use of analog and digital coprocessing to achieve stable and signal distortion-free clock recovery with lower cost, lowest power, and minimum logic resource consumption.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasound detection is a potent tool for the clinical diagnosis of various diseases due to its real-time, convenient, and noninvasive qualities. Yet, existing ultrasound beamforming and related methods face a big challenge to improve both the quality and speed of imaging for the required clinical applications. The most notable characteristic of ultrasound signal data is its spatial and temporal features. Because most signals are complex-valued, directly processing them by using real-valued networks leads to phase distortion and inaccurate output. In this study, for the first time, we propose a complex-valued convolutional gated recurrent (CCGR) neural network to handle ultrasound analytic signals with the aforementioned properties. The complex-valued network operations proposed in this study improve the beamforming accuracy of complex-valued ultrasound signals over traditional real-valued methods. Further, the proposed deep integration of convolution and recurrent neural networks makes a great contribution to extracting rich and informative ultrasound signal features. Our experimental results reveal its outstanding imaging quality over existing state-of-the-art methods. More significantly, its ultrafast processing speed of only 0.07 s per image promises considerable clinical application potential. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzm0128/CCGR.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of connected vehicles has posed significant challenges in managing computational offloading in vehicular networks. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing have opened up new possibilities for optimizing computational offloading in vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems. This article addresses the critical and pressing issue of leveraging these new technologies to optimize the allocation of vehicular computational offloading resources at edge servers, with the aim of improving the efficiency of computational offloading services while reducing costs. We focus on the computational offloading problem in a distributed edge computing system, where computational tasks from vehicles can be processed by multiple edge computing resource units (ECRUs). To tackle this problem, we first model the optimization of computational offloading resources as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), taking into account system income, cost expenditure, and other relevant domains. We then propose an Enhanced Deep Q-Learning (EDQL) approach, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the optimization problem effectively. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EDQL approach achieves fast convergence speed, high convergence stability, and superior performance compared to existing methods.",

In this paper, we use a wearable Electromyography sensor to acquire signals and propose an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the variational mode decomposition algorithm and combine it with an improved wavelet thresholding method to denoise the Electromyography signals. Compared to traditional denoising methods, the flexible Electromyography sensor offers superior fit and wearability. This approach achieves the highest signal-to-noise ratio and correlation coefficient, as well as the lowest root mean square error, resulting in better overall processing performance.

        "abstract": "Z-pinches can be used as a soft X-ray source to investigate the radiation coupling of planetary materials such as Fe and Al and the response of the sample to stress waves. In these experiments, the energy fluence on the sample must be measured, and a novel measurement presented in this article is just designed to determine the energy fluence incident on the target. The measurement system consists of a pinhole array and a nickel foil bolometer, while the pinhole array is used to attenuate the X-ray flux in an achromatic manner. Compared with the traditional means, this method is a direct measurement of the energy fluence, while the traditional way is deducing the fluence value based on the premise of an inverse-square radial dependence along a line-of-sight distance. Furthermore, this new method allows reduction of the X-ray intensity to avoid saturation problems while avoiding the spectral dependency of thin-film filters. This achromatically filtered bolometer has been installed on the Qiangguang-I facility to monitor the energy fluence on the target located 5 cm from the Z-pinch source, the diameters of samples are usually 1 cm or so, and the corresponding solid angles are 0.01 $\\pi $ . The experimental results show that the pinhole array is feasible to be used as an attenuator. Furthermore, it can mitigate the nonuniformity of the radiation flux on the target when the Z-pinch X-ray source is distorted by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) instability. The measured data on Qiangguang-I show that the energy fluence incident on the test object obeys the inverse-square law when the distance is bigger than 5 cm.",

        "abstract": "Under the background of big data, a series of power theft behaviors of residents not only cause significant economic losses but also bring incalculable security risks. According to the unique characteristics of residential users, a dual clustering detection model of power theft was proposed in this paper based on the analysis of users' power consumption behavior. First, by establishing a preliminary diagnosis model of power theft based on improved K-means clustering, the shortcomings of the original K-means algorithm, such as the determination of the K value and initial cluster center, low calculation efficiency, and vulnerability to noise, were improved. Second, based on the power consumption characteristics of residential users, their power consumption behavior patterns were classified, 11 types of residential power consumption patterns were summarized, and the final set of power thieves was determined by curve similarity analysis. The simulation results showed that the proposed model can significantly improve the detection rate, false detection rate, and other evaluation indicators for the dataset of residential users at the same time, which provides a reference for power theft detection in power supply companies.",

        "abstract": "Amidst the robust impetus from artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, edge intelligence (EI) has emerged as a nascent computing paradigm, synthesizing AI with edge computing (EC) to become an exemplary solution for unleashing the full potential of AI services. Nonetheless, challenges in communication costs, resource allocation, privacy, and security continue to constrain its proficiency in supporting services with diverse requirements. In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the systemâs adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network. This paper presents the findings of a literature review on the integration of EI and SL, summarizing the latest achievements in existing research on EI and SL. Subsequently, we delve comprehensively into the limitations of EI and how it could benefit from SL. Special emphasis is placed on the communication challenges and networking strategies and other aspects within these systems, underlining the role of optimized network solutions in improving system efficiency. Based on these discussions, we elaborate in detail on three integrated components: socialized architecture, socialized training, and socialized inference, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we identify some possible future applications of combining SL and EI, discuss open problems and suggest some future research, with the hope of arousing the research communityâs interest in this emerging and exciting interdisciplinary field.",

        "abstract": "In the era driven by big data and algorithms, the efficient collaboration of pervasive computing power is crucial for rapidly meeting computing demands and enhancing resource utilization. However, current mainstream end-edge-cloud collaboration faces challenges of computing isolation, adversely affecting resource efficiency and user experience. The Computing Power Network (CPN) is a novel architecture designed to sense and collaborate ubiquitous computing resources through networks. Nevertheless, the expansion of its scope and the integration of networks complicate task scheduling. To address this, we design a collaborative scheduling system that considers the joint selection of computing nodes and network links, aiming to reduce delay, enhance reliability, and ensure long-term load balance. Firstly, we propose a delay-prioritized reliable scheduling policy based on a dual-priority mechanism for forwarding and computing. Secondly, we define the scheduling problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and introduce Lyapunov optimization to transform constraints into instantaneous optimizations, achieving a long-term balanced load of computing and network resources. Lastly, we employ an enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to solve the problem. Performance evaluation demonstrates that compared to standard DRL, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces delay and improves reliability while maintaining long-term load balance, resulting in an overall performance improvement of 54.7%",
