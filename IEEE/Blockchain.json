        "abstract": "Recently, blockchain has become a crucial technology for addressing security concerns in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the substantial storage requirements of blockchain present a major obstacle to integrating IoT with blockchain. This paper introduces a novel coded blockchain architecture called locally repairable blockchain (LRB) to reduce the storage costs for IoT devices. Our architecture employs a node selection allocation algorithm to determine encoding parameters and local repair groups based on the blockchainâs current state, enhancing system availability. We also present a new coding process, GELRC, which combines group coding exchange methods with locally repairable codes, significantly reducing encoding complexity. GELRC facilitates low-cost local repair and improves fault tolerance. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized Vandermonde matrix for designing the local codes of LRB, enhancing the scalability of existing coded blockchains. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture outperforms previous coded blockchain solutions with greater fault tolerance, improved single-point repair capabilities, lower coding complexity, and particualrly, eliminates the need for re-encoding when new nodes are added.",

        "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) enables Metaverse Terminal Devices (MTD) to perform complex tasks, including graphic rendering and physical simulation, by leveraging low-latency outsourced computing. However, existing research has not fully addressed the challenge of establishing an efficient outsourced computing service within an open and dynamic MEC environment that simultaneously ensures privacy and accountability. To address this, we proposes a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and accountable mobile edge outsourcing computing framework for the Metaverse, termed Meta-BMEOC. Specifically, we have designed an outsourcing computing protocol based on smart contracts and threshold secret sharing, enabling MTD to outsource tasks to multiple edge servers while preserving privacy. Furthermore, we have developed an off-chain smart contract protocol based on a Trusted Execution Environment. This protocol is designed to reduce the risk of malicious edge servers colluding to reconstruct the computational tasks of MTD, and it enables accountability for servers that return erroneous results. Additionally, we designed an incentive mechanism to resist malicious attacks and ensure system security and stability. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that Meta-BMEOC not only ensures the privacy and accountability of outsourced computing but also provides outsourced computing services with lower computational latency.",

        "abstract": "Sharding has the potential to overcome the scalability constraints of monolithic blockchains. However, some challenges are associated with sharding, such as optimizing the placement of transactions into shards to minimize cross-shard transactions, balancing workload as shard capacity increases, and identifying shards that process transactions maliciously. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical high-performance blockchain (Hiba) architecture. Hiba leverages inter-shard to facilitate cross-shard consensus, where a pre-selected subset of nodes from both transaction originating and receiving shards collaboratively participate in the validation process. This design ensures the validity of transactions and mitigates double-spending risks across various shards. Simultaneously, it reduces validation costs by eliminating the need for all nodes in both shards to actively participate in the consensus process. Additionally, Hiba implements a novel multi-tiered validation system. Following initial validation at the intra-shard and inter-shard levels, a subset of randomly chosen or suspicion-based transactions undergoes further validation through auxiliary consensus. This auxiliary consensus acts as a secondary validation layer, ensuring the integrity of the intra-shard/inter-shard consensus process. To improve transaction processing efficiency, we implement an optimized workload distribution scheme based on fitness functions to minimize the number of cross-shard transactions. The experimental results demonstrate that Hiba surpasses the existing works regarding throughput and latency.",

        "abstract": "With the flourishing of the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT), analyzing large-volume sensor data has become a regular requirement for agricultural decision-making. Federated Learning (FL), which facilitates scattered AIoT devices to train models collaboratively, has gained significant attention. However, traditional FL poses challenges in AIoT scenarios, such as wide geo-distribution, heterogeneous data distribution, and high device risks. Existing works tend to be one-sided and remain unclear on how to tackle these issues thoroughly in AIoT. To fill the gap, we present, a double-layer blockchain-based FL framework, which enhances both learning efficiency and security for AIoT. The double-layer blockchain, coupled with a two-stage consensus algorithm, drives the hierarchical FL process to enable efficient and reliable agricultural knowledge-sharing. In addition, adopts an adaptive model aggregation algorithm to dynamically tune noise levels based on the model quality, further improving the learning security and model credibility. Finally, the extensive experimental results demonstrate that not only improves the model accuracy by up to 21.17% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, but also enhances the privacy protection within an additional error of only 2.1%.",

        "abstract": "The industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT) has attracted extensive attention due to its real-time and automation characteristics. Edge computing and blockchain technologies facilitate the IIoT in terms of low latency services and data security respectively. However, with the continuous expansion of industrial data and the growth of industrial nodes, traditional blockchain technology has some critical limitations on low transaction throughput and high data storage costs. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain adopts a graph structure of a single transaction as the basic unit, and it has the characteristics of asynchronous consensus. Some existing studies use DAGblockchain to replace the traditional blockchain to alleviate its low throughput problems like IOTA. However, with the rapid data generation in the IIoT environment, the topology scale of DAG-blockchain will increase sharply, which will aggravate the data storage cost of blockchain nodes. In this article, to reduce the data storage cost of edge servers, we design a Graphpartition based storage strategy for DAG-Blockchain (GpDB), equipped with a graph partition algorithm based on transaction freshness, which can partition DAG-blockchain topology in edge servers into two parts, which will be retained and removed respectively. Simulation shows that, in terms of storage cost, GpDB outperforms LDV and Layerchain by 62% and 74% respectively, and with the increasing number of transactions, GpDB has good scalability in reducing the storage cost, and better transaction throughput than IOTA.",

        "abstract": "Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) has become a novel paradigm for enabling data collection by worker recruitment, and the reputation plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality data. Although identity, data, and bid privacy preserving have been thoroughly investigated with the advance of blockchain technology, existing literature barely focuses on reputation privacy, which prevents malicious workers from submitting false data that could affect truth discovery for data requester. Therefore, we propose a Blockchain-Based Reputation Privacy Preserving for Quality-Aware Worker Recruitment Scheme (BRPP-QWR). First, we design a lightweight privacy preserving scheme for the whole life cycle of the workerâs reputation, which adopts sub-address retrieval technique combined with Pedersen Commitment and Compact Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (CLSAG) signature to enable fast and anonymous verification of the reputation update process. Subsequently, to tackle the unknown worker recruitment problem, we propose a Reputation, Selfishness, and Quality-based Multi-Armed Bandit (RSQ-MAB) learning algorithm to select reliable and high-quality workers. Lastly, we implement a prototype system on Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the performance of the reputation management scheme. The results indicate that the execution latency for the reputation score verification and retrieval latency can be reduced by an average of 6.30%â56.90% compared with ARMS-MCS. In addition, experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets show that the proposed RSQ-MAB algorithm achieves an increase of at least 20.05% in regard to the data requesterâs total revenue and a decrease of at least 48.55% and 3.18% in regret and Multi-round Average Error (MAE), respectively, compared with other benchmark methods.",

        "abstract": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), attracting interest from a variety of audiences including collectors and traders, saw transactions exceeding ${\\$}$ 50 billion in 2022. The inherent features of blockchain technologyâdistributed, immutable, and transparentâmake it an ideal platform for verifying ownership of digital assets. Despite these advantages, the high computational and transaction costs of networks, which utilizes proof of work pose significant challenges. To overcome these, alternative public blockchains have been developed, each offering unique benefits for NFT marketplaces. Choosing the right blockchain platform is crucial but complex. In our study, we introduce a prototype NFT marketplace optimized for scalability and efficiency, capable of rapidly handling a large volume of NFT transactions. We also conducted a comparative analysis of various public blockchains to identify the most cost-effective and reliable options for NFT exchanges. Further, we developed two predictive models to enhance decision-making around transaction fees and error management, thus improving cost-efficiency and reliability. We also propose a self-adaptive mechanism that allows for dynamic switching between blockchain platforms, enhancing the flexibility, and overall performance of the marketplace. Our contributions are integrated into IntelliChain, a self-adaptive framework designed to predict optimal transaction fees, reduce errors, and adapt to changing conditions like network stability and fee structures, bolstering efficiency, and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two rapidly evolving technologies that have found applications across various domains as abundant data is available through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. As a digital ledger technology, blockchain establishes a distributed platform for transparent and reliable transactions. On the other hand, AI automates and enhances decision-making in business activities and personal contexts. While each technology excels in its own right, their integration mutually benefits and forms a powerful alliance that provides substantial value. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of current research on the integration of AI and blockchain. Specifically, it explores how blockchain enhances AI functionality, how AI supports blockchain, the advantages derived from their convergence in securing and improving various domains including IoT applications and beyond, as well as the challenges, opportunities, emerging trends, and future research directions in exploring their convergence.",

        "abstract": "The wireless blockchain network (WBN) concept, born from the blockchain deployed in wireless networks, has appealed to many network scenarios. Blockchain consensus mechanisms (CMs) are key to enabling nodes in a wireless network to achieve consistency without any trusted entity. However, consensus reliability will be seriously affected by the instability of communication links in wireless networks. Meanwhile, it is difficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. Energy-intensive blockchain functions can quickly drain the power of nodes, thus degrading consensus performance. Fortunately, a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can solve the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages over the radio frequency (RF) signal emitted from a primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption, and the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. Such an approach is useful for almost all vote-based CMs, such as the Practical Byzantine Fault-tolerant (PBFT)-like and the RAFT-like CMs. This paper proposes symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC) by transforming 6 PBFT-like and 4 RAFT-like state-of-the-art (SOTA) CMs to demonstrate universality. These new CMs will benefit from mutualistic transmission relationships in SR, making full use of the limited spectrum resources in WBN. Simulation results show that SBC can increase the consensus success rate of PBFT-like and RAFT-like by 54.1% and 5.8%, respectively, and reduce energy consumption by 9.2% and 23.7%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has made remarkable achievements in medical and e-healthcare services. Different healthcare institutions can jointly train models to facilitate intelligent diagnosis. However, the model gradients transmitted among these institutions may still leak private information about the local models and training datasets. Additionally, in the current FL schemes, institutions with different quantities or qualities of medical data usually get the same training models, which may significantly hamper their motivation. Therefore, ensuring privacy and fairness in collaborative training remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Fair FL scheme (EPFFL) to support distributed large-scale data sharing of e-healthcare services. In the training process, participants upload the encrypted model gradients according to their sharing wishes to the blockchain while storing their training data locally. Hence, the FL initiator can only get the aggregated gradients from the blockchain rather than the local data of other participants. Moreover, EPFFL ensures fairness by evaluating the participants' contributions, i.e., participants with different data qualities and sharing levels can obtain the final models with different accuracies at the end of the training. Through theoretical and simulation analysis, the scheme shows superior functionalities on privacy preservation and fairness with the ideal model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "With the development of blockchain applications, demand for cross-chain technology has been increasing. Relay chain mode is the state-of-the-art and mainstream solution nowadays. However, the relay chain mode suffers from poor performance, which stems from its core facility â the relay chain. Therefore, guiding its improvement and parameters configuration is vital. Currently, there is no specialized performance model of the relay chain. The cross-chain scenario involves receiving transactions from blockchains and uniformly verifying them, while general blockchain models are not applicable for it. Relay chains are characterized by the following features: transaction arrival in batches with uncertain sizes, updating block headers for simplified payment verification (SPV), Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) type protocol, and different packaging rules. This work first proposes an analytical framework for relay chain performance. It captures the mentioned features by constructing a batch-arrival and bulk-service model. We give a concrete calculation of the relay chain with practical BFT (PBFT) consensus and develop a method to arrive at the computational forms of two essential performance descriptors: system throughput and cross-chain transaction confirmation delay. Through this model, we can judge accurately whether the relay chain is overloaded, and eliminate the overload state by tuning the parameters; and we can evaluate the system performance under different traffic and design parameters. Finally, we verify the model through experiments. With our study, operators can configure the system parameters effectively and improve the relay chain to meet the requirements of practical use.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has emerged as a pivotal technological innovation with far-reaching implications across various industries. Initially conceptualized by researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in the early 1990s, blockchain was envisioned as a system to ensure timestamp accuracy and document integrity. The seminal Bitcoin whitepaper, authored by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, introduced a decentralized blockchain-based digital currency system, with the mining of the âgenesis blockâ on 3 January 2009, marking a milestone in its development. Subsequently, the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Namecoin, based on forks of the Bitcoin network, led to explorations of diverse use cases for blockchain technology beyond its original scope.",

In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "Isolatability and scalability are two critical issues faced by blockchain. Blockchain interoperability addresses isolatability between heterogeneous blockchains, while sharding-based blockchain achieves scalability by solving isolatability of homogeneous blockchains running in different shards. To ensure atomicity between different blockchains, they both need to overcome two significant problems: (1) how to handle cross-chain transactions without trusting any third parties; (2) how to enhance the resistance to double-spending attacks of participating blockchains. To this end, this work presents a two-tier multi-zone architecture, Distributed and Parallel Blockchain ( DP-Chain ), where Consensus Zone in tier-1 features blockchain interoperability and sharding-based blockchain by allowing homogeneous or heterogeneous blockchains run in different zones, while Coordination Layer in tier-2 allows them to interoperate as a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) without trusting any third parties. Meanwhile, the coordination scheme between the two tiers is designed to resist potential double-spending attacks. Then, stochastic models are used to capture DP-Chain consensus process and analyze the probability of successful double-spending attacks. These analyses can help understand DP-Chain easily and offer theoretical guidelines for further implementations. Finally, based on the proposed architecture, a practical system is realized with C++ and open in Github for testing. Extensive experiments show correctness and effectiveness of this design.",

        "abstract": "The Blockchain Trilemma concept highlights the inherent trade-off among security, decentralization, and scalability in blockchain systems, where achieving all three simultaneously is challenging. Blockchain security can be categorized into block security and incentive security, with overall security increasing with the size of block producers. Horizontal scaling of a blockchain, through reducing the size of block producers, can compromise security, while vertical scaling, by increasing the computational requirements for producers, reduces decentralization. Consequently, solving the Blockchain Trilemma while maintaining overall blockchain security is a significant challenge using current methods. This paper introduces a time-beacon scheme to address the Blockchain Trilemma by restructuring the blockchain architecture. We argue that this scheme enables infinite horizontal scalability of the blockchain while preserving security and decentralization.",

        "abstract": "Payment channels serve as a promising solution to improving the scalability of permissionless blockchains, each of which allows two users to perform off-chain payments with almost unlimited frequency. Nevertheless, the payment channel risks encountering fund depletion, which threatens the availability of off-chain payments. The most recent method needs a cycle-based channel rebalancing procedure, which requires a fair leader and users with rebalancing demands forming directed cycles in the network. Therefore, its large-scale applications are restricted. Moreover, the privacy issue is not considered, leading to the leakage of rebalancing information. In this work, we introduce Shaduf++, a novel non-cycle off-chain rebalancing protocol that offers a new solution for users to shift coins among any channels to which they belong directly without relying on the cycle setting, and therefore could be applied to more general rebalancing scenarios. Furthermore, utilizing the cryptography primitives, including the commitment and the range proof schemes, Shaduf++ preserves the privacy for the rebalancing operations. We provide the details of Shaduf++ and formally prove its security under the Universal Composability framework. Our prototype demonstrates its feasibility and the experimental evaluation shows that Shaduf++ enhances the Lighting Network performance in payment success ratio and volume.",

        "abstract": "Integrating blockchain technology into the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has revolutionized industries, enabling decentralized and reliable management of systems, while improving both efficiency and security. However, a key challenge for blockchain-based IoT solutions is ensuring the accuracy of data fed into the blockchain, known as the âblockchain oracle problem.â This work addresses this challenge by proposing the BIVO system (Blockchain Information Verification Oracles), a blockchain-based decentralized oracle for IoT networks. The system utilizes a reputation and voting mechanism suitable for both crowdsourced and semi-controlled environments. We also model the weighted voting mechanism as a stochastic game and conduct stress tests to analyze the systemâs expected accuracy and cumulative payoffs under various conditions. Our findings indicate that the system achieves higher accuracy compared to non-weighted voting approaches. In semi-controlled environments, the system demonstrates resilience against up to 64% of adversarial nodes. However, under the worst conditions, malicious nodes need to control no more than 36% of the network to benefit from malicious behavior. Additionally, we implemented a prototype of the BIVO system and deployed it on both a local blockchain simulator and the public Ethereum testnet Sepolia to evaluate the cost and feasibility of blockchain integration.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of malicious nodes in blockchain networks poses a serious threat to the integrity and security of these systems. Malicious activities can disrupt the consensus process and compromise the overall security of the network. Although traditional consensus mechanisms have proven effective to some extent, they often struggle to tolerate many malicious nodes, which can lead to network instability or even failure. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a novel blockchain sharding consensus algorithm designed to withstand an unlimited scale of malicious nodes (USMN-SCA). Our approach leverages a dynamic credit mechanism to evaluate node behavior and categorize nodes into different credit levels. By dividing the blockchain network into credit-based shards and isolating low-credit nodes, we mitigate the impact of malicious activities and improve the networkâs resilience. USMN-SCA employs a two-stage consensus process: first, within each shard, and then between shards. This ensures that consensus is reached efficiently while maintaining a high level of security. We implement the USMN-SCA algorithm in a prototype via blockchain sharding and deploy it on the Alibaba Cloud. The experimental results show that our protocol significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of security, with a success probability of 100% in a real-world web environment, even more then 50% of the nodes are malicious. Additionally, the consensus delay and throughput performance are comparable to those of other state-of-the-art consensus algorithms. These findings establish the USMN-SCA as a cutting-edge solution with high applicability, scalability, and compatibility across various blockchain platforms. This work represents a significant advancement in blockchain security and performance optimization, paving the way for more secure and efficient blockchain applications.",

        "abstract": "The electronic era is providing many opportunities to the consumers by exploiting advanced technologies such as Blockchain, AI driven solutions, Internet of Everything (IoE), optical technologies and 6G networks. Blockchain users need to analyse and examine the diverse transactions recorded on the ledger. In Blockchain technology, transparency and decentralization are the key features for the users and transaction analysis plays integral role in ensuring the privacy of data, security of user credentials, and efficiency of the Blockchain network. By analyzing the features of data, patterns of data, and behaviors of transactions, the Blockchain users can determine the flow of digital assets and also examine the pulse of the Blockchain ecosystem. The smart contacts in blockchain are also seeking for the transaction analysis as it is very important for implementation of the smart contracts to follow transparency attributes and transaction conditions along with patterns in transactions. This research is using two-fold methodology. In first module, a double-layer model (DLM) is designed. The DLM is constructed through the target detection layer and target segmentation layer. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed algorithm has high classification accuracy of 94%. In second module, a Cosine similarity is used to find distance in the data-points and then the XGBoost classifier classifies the transaction data more easily by attainting the classification accuracy of 98% with lower time complexity.",

        "abstract": "The acceptability of blockchain technology has experienced significant growth due to its innovative nature, encompassing several key elements such as distributed data storage, peer-to-peer networking, integrity verification, consensus algorithms, cryptography, and smart contracts. The consensus algorithm plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of blockchain systems. The ongoing expansion of the digital economy presents a persistent challenge in identifying or constructing an optimal blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithm that effectively addresses specific business requirements especially for various applications of consumer electronics. This research study introduces a novel approach to enhance blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithms, prioritizing the augmentation of throughput, leaderâs capacity, and enhancement of fault tolerance. The solution under consideration employs committees established by the Louvain Modularity Optimisation (LMO) algorithm for local blockchain, along with reputation-based leader selection, to safeguard the integrity of the blockchain network globally. The proposed approach distributes the transactions among the committees and demonstrates an average throughput that is about 1.6 times greater than that of RapidChain following 100 iterations and 1.14 times more than that of the sharding technique. The results indicate that the utilization of reputation-based leader selection and immediate leader replacement, which is based on reputation score, effectively enhances the resilience of the system against attacks, while simultaneously boosting the overall throughput.",

        "abstract": "The role of Big-data is imperative in Blockchain-based trading systems, cloud-based applications, P2P-based applications, and parallel communications. It is very important to fuse the data obtained from heterogeneous Blockchain nodes in such a way that it can provide some useful information after processing. The analysis of the data must be made without losing the useful chunks of the information especially when it involves financial transactions. By combining the data from multiple sources in a Blockchain environment, the accuracy and completeness of data can be assured. The reliability of data is also enhanced since the data can be validated easily with the cross-reference points. The integration of data allows comprehensive analysis of data and also helps in decision making. It also helps in detection of frauds by reducing the dimensionality of data. In order to improve the interaction in the data, and to enhance the data transmission rate, a new soft computing based data fusion control model has been proposed in this article for the fusion of data in Blockchain databases that supports communications over 6G channels. The proposed model comprises hardware and software components along with soft computing based smart data fusion mechanism. The proposed soft computing-based mechanism behaves smartly to process the volume of data by training the system implicitly. The fuzzy logic-based similarity matrix is also devised by calculating the similarity in the data instances to make the system more adaptive. The fusion of a Big-data in the Blockchain systems is performed on the basis of the proposed model for controlling the data interactions. The empirical results show that the proposed data fusion control model for Big-data in the Blockchain system is reliable, secure, and has lower response time. The packet loss rate is low and data transmission is high which proves the viability and robustness of the proposed fusion model for Blockchain enabled applications.",

        "abstract": "Supply Chain Finance (SCF) can better relieve the predicament of capital constraints and provide financial support for capital-constrained enterprises by relying on trade relations among enterprises. However, SCF is facing predicament such as insufficient credit mechanism and difficulty in trust transmission. Blockchain have great application advantages in SCF dilemma. This paper puts blockchain into the Accounts Receivable Financing (ARF), uses game analysis method, cooperative game and non-cooperative game are adopted. It discusses the equilibrium strategy in four situations: non-cooperative decision without blockchain, cooperative decision without blockchain, non-cooperative decision with blockchain and cooperative decision with blockchain. At the same time, the mechanism of risk sharing and benefit sharing is introduced. It is found that the blockchain will make companies get higher profits than without blockchain. Blockchain will reduce information collectionâ cost, improve financing efficiency. Cooperative decision can improve the overall financing efficiency more effectively than non-cooperative decision. Risk sharing mechanism and revenue sharing contract can effectively coordinate the interest conflicts of enterprises and improve the overall efficiency of supply chain. This study can provide useful decision reference for managers.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain rewriting is necessary for modifying illegal or invalid messages included in blockchain transactions, while maintaining the consistency of subsequent blocks in the blockchain. However, arbitrary blockchain rewriting is not desirable as it defeats the purpose of blockchain rewriting. In this work, we propose a new security primitive named message-controlled chameleon hash (MCH) and apply it for message control in blockchain rewriting to ensure that no unspecified messages are generated from blockchain rewriting. The proposed MCH enables permitted parties to select candidate messages from designated message sets for blockchain rewriting at the message level. Our evaluation shows that the performance of MCH is comparable to the classic CH [26] and the state-of-the-art CH [16]. We also show that the proposed MCH can be easily integrated into both permissioned and permissionless blockchains.",

        "abstract": "As the origin of blockchains, the Nakamoto Consensus protocol is the primary protocol for many public blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin) used in cryptocurrencies. Blockchains need to be decentralized as a core feature, yet it is difficult to strike a balance between scalability and security. Many approaches to improving blockchain scalability often result in diminished security or compromise the decentralized nature of the system. Inspired by network science, especially the epidemic model, we try to solve this problem by mapping the propagation of transactions and blocks as two interacting epidemics, called the CoSIS model. We extend the transaction propagation process to increase the efficiency of block propagation, which reduces the number of unknown transactions. The reduction of the block propagation latency ultimately increases the blockchain throughput. The theory of complex networks is employed to offer an optimal boundary condition. Finally, the node scores are stored in the chain, so that it also provides a new incentive approach. Our experiments show that CoSIS accelerates blocks!/ propagation and TPS is raised by 20% ~ 33% on average. At the same time, the system security can be significantly improved, as an orphaned block rate is close to zero in better cases. CoSIS enhances the scalability and security of the blockchain while ensuring that all changes do not compromise the decentralized nature of the blockchain.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain enhances the security and interoperability of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems by serving as a secure and decentralized platform for data sharing. The rapid growth of IoV data makes it challenging to store the entire blockchain on edge nodes with limited storage resources due to the blockchainâs immutability. Redactable blockchain represents a potential solution for enabling the controlled modification of data on blocks. However, current redactable blockchain schemes suffer from high computational overhead and lack support for stateful redaction and consistency checking. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient decentralized chameleon hash scheme (CHSTS) based on Schnorr threshold signatures. CHSTS allows t-out-of-n edge nodes to collaborate with the transaction proposer to compute chameleon hash collisions, enabling modification and deletion of block data without breaking the hash links between the blocks. We then construct a redactable blockchain utilizing CHSTS to alleviate the storage limitations of edge nodes. To ensure consistency checking and stateful redaction of the redactable blockchain, we design a novel modification verification mechanism based on vector commitments. Finally, we provide detailed security analysis of the CHSTS scheme and integrate the proposed scheme into Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the redactable blockchain through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that our scheme incurs less computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art chameleon hash schemes. Furthermore, our scheme maintains close efficiency compared to immutable blockchain, incurring negligible storage overhead.",

        "abstract": "The conventional Internet of Things-based soil moisture monitoring system for irrigation decision making suffers from huge network traffic, high latency and energy consumption, and compromise in data security. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-assisted decentralized federated learning strategy, Fedchain for irrigation decision making based on edge-cloud computing. A peer-to-peer network is formed among the edge servers. The edge servers have their local datasets, which are analyzed locally using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the model parameters are exchanged between the peer nodes. The model is updated accordingly. For data security purposes, blockchain is used. The LSTM model updates are recorded in the InterPlanetary File System by the local user, and a unique Content Identifier is generated for data retrieval, and it is stored in the blockchain as a transaction. A Distributed Hash Table in the file system maps the Content Identifier in the blockchain to the stored data in the file system, ensuring effective retrieval. The results show that Fedchain achieves above ~99% prediction accuracy, and reduces latency and energy consumption by 78% than the edge-cloud framework without federated learning. The use of blockchain reduces the mining cost by ~78% than the competing methods.",

        "abstract": "In the global pharmaceutical industry, dual-channel competition has become a common business model, where the synergy and competition between online and offline channels profoundly impact corporate strategic decision-making. This study constructs a dual-channel competition model for pharmaceutical regulatory products to explore blockchain adoption strategies and analyze their impact on corporate profits. Four adoption scenarios are defined: both online and offline channels do not adopt blockchain (NN), offline adopts while online does not (BN), online adopts while offline does not (NB), and both online and offline channels adopt blockchain (BB). The methodology involves developing mathematical models for each scenario using parameters such as pricing, demand, and profit, followed by deriving equilibrium decisions for each model. Optimization techniques are used to solve for the optimal pricing and demand under the defined scenarios. Additionally, numerical analysis is conducted using hypothetical parameter values to evaluate the influence of factors like market potential demand, price sensitivity, and the negative impact of non-adoption. The findings reveal that the BB model consistently achieves the highest profit growth and resilience, demonstrating that full adoption of blockchain technology across both channels provides maximum benefits. Conversely, partial adoption (BN or NB) shows moderate improvement, while non-adoption (NN) leads to significant profit losses. This study highlights that adopting blockchain technology in dual-channel supply chains not only improves transparency, safety, and consumer trust but also optimizes profitability and risk resistance. For resource-constrained firms, a phased adoption strategyâstarting with the more profitable channelâis recommended to gradually enhance operational efficiency and market competitiveness.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain sharding has emerged as a promising solution to the scalability challenges in traditional blockchain systems by partitioning the network into smaller, manageable subsets called shards. Despite its potential, existing sharding solutions face significant limitations in handling dynamic workloads, ensuring secure cross-shard transactions, and maintaining system integrity. To address these gaps, we propose DYNASHARD, a dynamic and secure cross-shard transaction processing mechanism designed to enhance blockchain sharding efficiency and security. DYNASHARD combines adaptive shard management, a hybrid consensus approach, plus an efficient state synchronization and dispute resolution protocol. Our performance evaluation, conducted using a robust experimental setup with real-world network conditions and transaction workloads, demonstrates DYNASHARDâs superior throughput, reduced latency, and improved shard utilization compared to the fast transaction scheduling in blockchain sharding (FTSBS) method. Specifically, DYNASHARD achieves up to a 42.6% reduction in latency and a 78.77% improvement in shard utilization under high transaction volumes and varying cross-shard transaction ratios. These results highlight DYNASHARDâs ability to outperform state-of-the-art sharding methods, ensuring scalable and resilient blockchain systems. We believe that DYNASHARDâs innovative approach will significantly impact future developments in blockchain technology, paving the way for more efficient and secure distributed systems.",

        "abstract": "With the development of communication technology and Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is proposed in the automation industry for complex scenarios. Blockchain is applied in IIoT to solve data security and privacy issues related to centralized data storage and processing. However, there are inevitably performance issues with throughput constraints when blockchain manages large amounts of device data. This paper proposes a blockchain-supported performance optimization framework for IIoT systems using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. We model the blockchain performance optimization problem as a Markov decision process that optimizes the blockchainâs throughput by dynamically adjusting the block size and interval through DRL while satisfying security constraints. We use the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to deal with the dynamic and complexity of optimization problems due to the heterogeneity of equipment and diversified requirements. We also alleviate the overestimation problem caused by DQN. Meanwhile, we study the impact of the number of network layers and different activation units on the performance optimization method in DDQN. Finally, we prove that our work is feasible and effective through the case study based on actual IIoT scenario datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme enhances blockchain performance in IIoT systems. The detailed qualitative comparison with related work demonstrates the superiority and innovation of our work and proves that it improves the shortcomings of existing work.",

        "abstract": "Sharding is widely concerned to address the scalability limitations of blockchain in Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT). However, the scalability and throughput improved by using sharding are degraded by the validation of cross-shard transactions. Recent studies have proposed overlapping sharding architecture that converts cross-shard transactions into overlap-shard transactions, which processes cross-shard transaction validation within the overlapping part between shards, thereby greatly reduces the processing overhead. In the overlapping sharded blockchain, the performance of nodes of the overlapping parts is crucial to the security and throughput of the system. Because devices and servers in IIoT suffer from weak computing and storage capacity and are vulnerable to attacks. To allocate nodes to different overlapping shards to enhance cross-shard transaction validation and ensure security regarding the heterogeneity of devices remains as a critical problem for blockchain-based IIoT systems. To address that, we balance multiple factors affecting the throughput and security of sharded blockchain-based IIoT system, and abstract the overlapping shards formation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, we propose a novel Overlapping Sharding Optimization Mechanism based on genetic algorithms (OSOM) to solve it. Experimental results indicate that OSOM enhances both the security and performance of overlapping sharding systems in blockchain systems for IIoT.",

        "abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain-based cross-domain authentication schemes can effectively establish trust and share data across different administrative domainss. However, current blockchain-based cross-domain authentication solutions often overlook dynamic node participation challenges, which is crucial for the flexible IoT environment. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme that supports dynamic node participation, allowing administrative domainss to freely join or leave under legal conditions. Firstly, we introduce an efficient blockchain-based cross-domain authentication framework. Secondly, we propose a blockchain consensus algorithm that supports dynamic node participation to serve the aforementioned framework. Specifically, inspired by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocolâs piggybacking strategy, this algorithm integrates the process of node joining and leaving into the regular consensus flow to enhance efficiency. To further improve the algorithmâs efficiency, we designed compressed block and parallel chain structures to increase bandwidth utilization and throughput. Detailed correctness proofs demonstrate the algorithmâs security. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that our scheme increases throughput by approximately 8x compared to existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Auditability and verifiability are critical elements in establishing trustworthiness in federated learning (FL). These principles promote transparency, accountability, and independent validation of FL processes. Incorporating auditability and verifiability is imperative for building trust and ensuring the robustness of FL methodologies. Typical FL architectures rely on a trustworthy central authority to manage the FL process. However, reliance on a central authority could become a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cyber-attacks and insider frauds. Moreover, the central entity lacks auditability and verifiability, which undermines the privacy and security that FL aims to ensure. This article proposes an auditable and verifiable decentralized FL (DFL) framework. We first develop a smart-contract-based monitoring system for DFL participants. This monitoring system is then deployed to each DFL participant and executed when the local model training is initiated. The monitoring system records necessary information during the local training process for auditing purposes. Afterward, each DFL participant sends the local model and monitoring system to the respective blockchain node. The blockchain nodes representing each DFL participant exchange the local models and use the monitoring system to validate each local model. To ensure an auditable and verifiable decentralized aggregation procedure, we record the aggregation steps taken by each blockchain node in the aggregation contract. Following the aggregation phase, each blockchain node applies a multisignature scheme to the aggregated model, producing a globally verifiable model. Based on the signed global model and the aggregation contract, each blockchain node implements a consensus protocol to store the validated global model in tamper-proof storage. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a series of experiments with different machine learning architectures and datasets, ...",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of devices and data in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has rendered the traditional centralized cloud model unable to meet the stringent requirements of wide-scale and low latency in these IIoT scenarios. As emerging technologies, edge computing enables real-time processing and analysis on devices situated closer to the data source while reducing bandwidth requirements. Blockchain, being decentralized, could enhance data security. Therefore, edge computing and blockchain are integrated in IIoT to reduce latency and improve security. However, the inefficient data transmission of blockchain leads to increased transmission latency in the IIoT. To address this issue, we propose a cluster-based data transmission strategy (CDTS) for blockchain network. Initially, an improved weighted label propagation algorithm (WLPA) is proposed for clustering blockchain nodes. Subsequently, a spanning tree topology construction (STTC) is designed to simplify the blockchain network topology, based on the above node clustering results. Additionally, leveraging clustered nodes and tree topology, we propose a data transmission strategy to speed up data transmission. Simulation experiments show that CDTS effectively reduces data transmission time and better supports large-scale IIoT scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The widespread smart devices raise people's concerns of being eavesdropped on. To enhance voice privacy, recent studies exploit the nonlinearity in microphone to jam audio recorders with inaudible ultrasound. However, existing solutions solely rely on energetic masking. Their simple-form noise leads to several problems, such as high energy requirements and being easily removed by speech enhancement techniques. Besides, most of these solutions do not support authorized recording, which restricts their usage scenarios. In this paper, we design an efficient yet robust system that can jam microphones while preserving authorized recording. Specifically, we propose a novel phoneme-based noise with the idea of informational masking, which can distract both machines and humans and is resistant to denoising techniques. Besides, we optimize the noise transmission strategy for broader coverage and implement a hardware prototype of our system. Experimental results show that our system can reduce the recognition accuracy of recordings to below 50% under all tested speech recognition systems, which is much better than existing solutions.",

        "abstract": "The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made the traditional Consumer Electronics (CE) evolve into a next-generation CE with many intelligent application which generates a large number of computing-intensive tasks and is sensitive to latency. The combination of blockchain technology and multi-UAV-assisted edge computing is considered a promising technology that can process tasks near CE devices instead of sending data to remote data centers, and it has advantages in flexible deployment, differentiated services, and security assurance. This paper considers a Blockchain-enabled MEC scenario where CE devices can offload tasks to multiple-UAV-edge layers for decentralized cooperative computing, and utilize the reputation mechanism of blockchain to identify abnormal nodes in edge offloading. To solve the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation in this scenario, we jointly optimize the CPU cycle frequencies and offloading resources of UAVs and CE devices, and the decision of UAVs. Our goal is to minimize system energy consumption while ensuring the quality of service. The stochastic optimization technique is employed to transform the original stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic optimization problem, decomposing it into multiple sub-problems which can be solved in parallel. Additionally, we design a dynamic priority scoring strategy to facilitate cooperative processing among multiple UAVs and propose a Blockchain-Based Multi-UAV Cooperative Task Offloading (BMCTO) algorithm. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the BMCTO algorithm can effectively reduce system energy consumption while maintaining system performance.",

        "abstract": "Leveraging blockchain in Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new paradigm for secure collaborative learning on Massive Edge Networks (MENs). As the scale of MENs increases, it becomes more difficult to implement and manage a blockchain among edge devices due to complex communication topologies, heterogeneous computation capabilities, and limited storage capacities. Moreover, the lack of a standard metric for blockchain security becomes a significant issue. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight blockchain for verifiable and scalable FL, namely LiteChain, to provide efficient and secure services in MENs. Specifically, we develop a distributed clustering algorithm to reorganize MENs into a two-level structure to improve communication and computing efficiency under security requirements. Moreover, we introduce a Comprehensive Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism and a secure update mechanism to ensure the security of model transactions through LiteChain. Our experiments based on Hyperledger Fabric demonstrate that LiteChain presents the lowest end-to-end latency and on-chain storage overheads across various network scales, outperforming the other two benchmarks. In addition, LiteChain exhibits a high level of robustness against replay and data poisoning attacks.",

        "abstract": "The Execute-Order-Validate blockchain enhances performance by allowing parallel transaction execution, yet it also introduces transaction conflicts that can cause state inconsistencies in the ledger. Previous research has focused on resolving conflicts under the assumption of the âgoodâ intent of the senders. In this paper, we explore an unstudied scenario where a malicious user can intentionally generate transaction collisions to disrupt the service request of a target user to the underlying decentralized application (DApp). We call it manipulated transaction collision (MTC) attack. We overcome the challenges of identifying the conditions and best strategies to launch this targeted attack under various network settings. Our experiment results show that the MTC attack can effectively cause the victim to be continuously rejected by the blockchain, i.e., over 90% success rate in all tested cases on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. To combat this new threat, we first propose a machine-learning-assisted detection method that helps identify the adversarial behavior within massive background traffic. To further enhance blockchain resilience, we propose a more precise transaction conflicts definition and present a novel mitigation method, which not only prevents the attack but also significantly reduces the probability of natural conflicts by up to 75% in the tested DApp compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.",

        "abstract": "Sixth generation (6G) networks deploy unmanned aerial vehicles and mobile edge computing to provide collaborative computing and reliable connectivity for resource-limited mobile devices (MDs). However, due to the untrusted and broadcast nature of wireless transmission among communicating MDs and computing resource providers, ensuring the security of resource transactions will be challenging. Blockchain-based resource-sharing systems have been proposed to address security issues. However, these systems use existing consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work that consume massive amounts of system resources. In addressing this, some studies attempted to use single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in leader selection. Nevertheless, these solutions overlooked the intelligence and flexibility of blockchain configuration, and a single-point of failure can cause the system to fail. We propose a multi-agent Distributed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MAD3PG)-assisted consensus mechanism for blockchain-based collaborative resource-sharing to address these issues. First, we propose a stochastic game-based incentive-mechanism to encourage consensus nodes to participate in transaction validation. Then, we formulate the optimization problem of node selection and blockchain configuration as a Markov decision process and solve it with the MAD3PG algorithm. With MAD3PG, the agents select consensus nodes based on their experience and available resources and dynamically adjust blockchain settings. The simulation results show that MAD3PG outperforms the benchmarks in maximizing throughput and incentive while minimizing block production latency.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the secure task offloading and computation resource allocation issues in a consortium blockchain-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) system. Specifically, edge servers and a cloud center provides user equipments (UEs) with augmented computing power for task processing, while consortium blockchain can provide trust and secure guarantee to UEs in task offloading. Within the MEC system, we intend to minimize the task processing cost of all UEs by jointly optimizing the binary task offloading decision and the computation resource block allocation. Meanwhile, in the blockchain system, we first enhance the consensus procedure by proposing an improved practical Byzantine fault tolerance (IPBFT) consensus algorithm, and then conduct consensus committee selection, thus to minimize consensus delay and fail ratio. The two systems are jointly optimized, subjecting to the computation power of edge nodes, the node number limitation of IPBFT, the task processing and blockchain consensus delay, etc. To address the problem effectively, we reform it into a Markov decision process (MDP) and use proximal policy optimization (PPO) to dynamically learn the optimal joint solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm converges fast, and performs well in total reward maximization, and UEsâ cost, consensus delay and fail ratio minimization.",

        "abstract": "In the landscape of Industry 4.0, enhancing data traceability across the supply chain is imperative. With the development of quantum computers, blockchains traditionally used for traceability struggle to guarantee the authenticity of data. Furthermore, only chained blocks have been used in previous traceability systems, which has resulted in a full backup for each business unit in the supply chain, wasting storage resources significantly. Another problem is that there are differences in the data structure and consensus mechanisms of each unit, which makes maintenance difficult. To address these problems, it is encouraging to create a new blockchain with high scalability and resistance to quantum attacks. This paper innovatively proposes a quantum hybrid blockchain-based data authenticity framework (QHB-DA) with five layers, which not only accomplishes traceability, but also has assurance that data can withstand verification. In QHB-DA, blockchain utilizes a combination of DAG and chained structures to reduce data redundancy, in which quantum hashes are performed to connect blocks. Algorithms ED-QKD and D2B-QSC are designed to keep the information from being leaked during transmission and format conversion. Through cost-benifit analysis, security analysis and empirical experiments, feasibility of quantum hashing and the attack resistance of the QHB-DA are demonstrated, which can reduce storage wastage and completely implement the data authenticity.",

        "abstract": "The privacy-preserving query is critical for modern blockchain systems, especially when supporting many crucial applications such as finance and healthcare. Recent advances in blockchain query schemes mainly focus on enhancing the traceability efficiency of integrity authentication. Despite these efforts, we argue that the exposure of retrieval information may result in privacy leakage, which inevitably poses an important yet unresolved challenge. In this paper, we introduce Cloak, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain query scheme with two notable features. First, it utilizes a two-phase distributed query requests technique, i.e., division and aggregation, to hide retrieval information based on the natural independent characteristic of blockchain. Second, we add noise to the sub-request set to avoid malicious attacks during transmission and adopt smart contract-based asymmetric encryption to guarantee the correctness of query results. Experimental results demonstrate that Cloak improves the query performance by up to 4Ã and reduces the storage overhead by 50% compared with the state-of-the-art Spiral.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain-enhanced Smart Grid is being deeply studied by many scholars because of its unique advantages in system and security of distributed accounting and traceability. However, the problems of data privacy disclosure and low efficiency are still worthy of the attention of most researchers. In this paper, we design a general three-tier architecture of Smart Grid based on blockchain, including edge layer, permissioned blockchain layer, and application layer. Furthermore, for the three-tier architecture, a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme without a trusted authority is proposed by adopting fog computing, permissioned blockchain, Paillier homomorphic encryption system, and Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystems. This scheme can realize range query in batch, while it can also protect privacy and resist collusion attack. Performance evaluations and experiment comparisons show that our scheme has good advantages: higher efficiency and lower storage, and thus it can meet increasing data service requirements.",

        "abstract": "The increased demand for personalized customization calls for new production modes to enhance collaborations among a wide range of manufacturing practitioners who unnecessarily trust each other. In this article, a blockchain-enabled manufacturing collaboration framework is proposed, with a focus on the production capacity matching problem for blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) collaboration. First, a digital model of production capacity description is built for trustworthy and transparent sharing over the blockchain. Second, an optimization problem is formulated for P2P production capacity matching with objectives to maximize both social welfare and individual benefits of all participants. Third, a feasible solution based on an iterative double auction mechanism is designed to determine the optimal price and quantity for production capacity matching with a lack of personal information. It facilitates automation of the matching process while protecting users' privacy via blockchain-based smart contracts. Finally, simulation results from the Hyperledger Fabric-based prototype show that the proposed approach increases social welfare by 1.4% compared to the Bayesian game-based approach, makes all participants profitable, and achieves 90% fairness of enterprises.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) relies on crypto assets in blockchains to provide financial services. High volatility of crypto assets puts users at risk of financial loss. Options contracts address this issue by empowering a buyer to exchange his asset with that of a seller, which mitigates risks for both parties. Existing options contract protocols have the following two weaknesses: (i) The buyer have to lock his asset during the contract's lifespan, incurring heavy opportunity costs; (ii) Turing-completed smart contract (TCSC)/hash time lock contract (HTLC) is required to exchange assets, which restricts applicability as TCSC/HTLC is supported by a limited number of blockchains. In this paper, we propose UP-BLOC, a universal and practical blockchain-based options contract. We construct UP-BLOC using a buyer-pay-first design, and propose a blockchain-based secret storage mechanism to ensure the security of the assets involved. This allows the buyer to engage in an options contract without locking any asset and resulting opportunity costs, and thus is more practical than existing works. Besides, UP-BLOC achieves the exchange of assets using standard digital signatures instead of TCSC/HTLC. Hence, UP-BLOC is compatible with all blockchains and is universal. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that UP-BLOC is secure and efficient.",

        "abstract": "With the prosperity of the blockchain and the DeFi ecosystem, money flow activities in the blockchains are becoming increasingly frequent, complex, and diverse. The Money Flow Graph (MFG) serves as the foundation for various behavioral analysis, malicious activity detection, and money flow tracing tasks. However, traditional graph databases face the issue of storage requirement and performance when analyzing large-scale MFGs. In this work, we present MFGSCOPE, a lightweight domain-specific framework designed for graph-based analysis on EVM-compatible blockchains, with extensive optimizations for storage efficiency and query performance. The prototype of MFGSCOPE for the Ethereum network achieves the storage of over 3 billion transfers and 1.7 billion relevant transactions in a single instance with less than 450 GB of disk usage. The evaluation shows that for common tasks, MFGSCOPE is more than 30 times faster and requires 78% less storage space than the commonly used graph database Neo4j. For the applications of MFGSCOPE, we present several use cases based on the MFG which cannot be performed efficiently using traditional graph databases and report interesting findings. To engage the community, the prototype of MFGSCOPE for the Ethereum blockchain with the complete dataset will be open source.",

        "abstract": "Ring signatures are a useful cryptographic technique for anonymous transactions on the blockchain, which allows a user to sign a message on behalf of a group, without revealing which specific member of the group did the signing. However, the anonymity it provides can at times be too powerful and needs to be controlled when used in practice (e.g., on a reliable blockchain anonymous transaction system). In order to address this issue, we propose a linkable, k-times traceable and revocable ring signature (Lk-TRS). Specifically, with respect to the same issue, Lk-TRS not only establishes links among fewer than k signatures of a signer but also enables tracing of the identity when the signer signs k times. Based on our Lk-TRS, we propose a blockchain anonymous transaction system that supports the identity binding of a single user to multiple accounts, as well as the dynamic joining and exiting of users. This ensures the system meets practical requirements and offers runtime flexibility. We prove that our Lk-TRS achieves anonymity, unforgeability, linkability, k-traceability, and exculpability. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our Lk-TRS is more practical for large blockchain systems, maintaining a constant signature size regardless of the ring size.",

        "abstract": "In this article, an efficient wireless federated learning (FL) framework based on blockchain (BC) assistance is studied. Many existing frameworks adopt lots of third-party servers as consensus nodes, which is vulnerable to collusion attacks. In our framework, the blockchain-assisted FL (BFL) model selects edge users as blockchain nodes without any third-party intervention. Besides, the convergence analysis of this FL algorithm considering transmission outages is provided to prove the effects of wireless factors on FL. To solve the low efficiency of the BC based on the conventional linear chain structure, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain is introduced into our work. Moreover, since the design and optimization of FL and BC in most existing works are done separately, this may result in sub-optimal performance. To achieve an excellent trade-off between FL efficiency and BC performance, a joint optimization problem regarding DAG-BFL is formulated. The optimization objective is to maximize the FL performance and DAG-BC throughput. To solve the complex nonconvex optimization problem, considering the resource-constrained BFL system, the joint communication and computing resource allocation as well as block designing schemes are proposed, which are based on the twin-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method and the successive block minimization technique (BSUM). Extensive simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, compared with the traditional alternative optimization, the proposed PDD-based algorithm achieves better performance.",

        "abstract": "In consumer electronics, Industry 5.0 offers the potential to combine human expertise with advanced technologies. This convergence creates opportunities for real-time healthcare services to be provided to remote consumers. Internet of Things (IoT) devices also play a crucial role in capturing and transmitting consumer monitoring data for analysis and review. However, the traditional approach to centralize IoT data processing and storage comes with risks such as data manipulation and privacy breaches. Blockchain technology provides a solution to these challenges. By decentralizing computation and storage for IoT data, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the e-healthcare industry. We focus on proposing a blockchain-based solution for securely sharing user health data among authorized stakeholders. Our access control architecture, based on blockchain technology, allows authorized parties to access data independently, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where third-party dependencies could hinder real-time data sharing. We have rigorously tested and validated our design to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Distributed DevOps is a software development methodology that aims to integrate the work of development and operations teams without being bound by geographical constraints. This methodology excels in enhancing collaboration and the speed of software development. However, it does suffer from a lack of security, transparency, and traceability, which can result in project delays, a lack of trust between stakeholders, and even project failure. This paper addresses these issues of Distributed DevOps by implementing Blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages blockchain technology to address the challenges faced by Distributed DevOps. Through performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a real-world scenario, highlighting its ability to improve transparency, traceability, and the security of the DevOps pipeline. Our findings underscore the potential of blockchain-empowered solutions in revolutionizing DevOps practices. Furthermore, this research offers a practical framework for organizations seeking to optimize their development processes by integrating blockchain technology.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of renewable energy and controllable loads such as consumer electronics requires more user side resources to participate in demand response. Blockchain-empowered demand response can effectively reduce the trust cost among various market entities. However, considering the efficient transaction processing and low-delay interaction requirements of the system, how to jointly optimize blockchain consensus throughput and consensus delay through secure resource management under the decentralization constraint is a key issue. The paper proposes an adaptive learning-based cloud-edge collaborative secure resource management method for blockchain-empowered demand response. Firstly, a blockchain-empowered secure demand response framework is constructed to achieve information exchange among multiple entities. Secondly, under a decentralization constraint in long term, the joint optimization problem of consensus throughput and consensus delay is formulated. The one-slot joint optimization problem is decoupled from long-term decentralization constraint through Lyapunov optimization theory. Finally, a block and channel resource collaboration management optimization algorithm based on security bound violation penalty-driven adaptive DQN is proposed. Based on the security bound violation penalty, the probabilities of exploration and exploitation in the learning process are adaptively adjusted to avoid falling into local optimum. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm performs well in consensus throughput, consensus delay, and decentralization degree.",

        "abstract": "Improved advancements in 5G communication and intelligent connected vehicle technologies have accelerated the implementation of intelligent transportation systems. Intelligent vehicles, roadside devices, and open wireless communication networks collectively expand the vulnerability landscape of intelligent transportation system (ITS) security, thereby increasing the potential exposure to security risks. Nonetheless, mobile vehicles require frequent authentication with Roadside Units (RSUs), which in turn results in substantial computational and communication overhead. Consequently, this approach leads to performance bottlenecks in resource-constrained On-Board Units (OBUs). In this paper, we are concerned with a lattice-based certificateless secure data transmission scheme for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) based on Blockchain. The proposed protocol incorporates identity authentication functionality and effectively integrates the cross-domain authentication characteristics of the Blockchain. Initially, the Trusted Authority (TA) uploads the registration information of vehicles onto the Blockchain to verify the authenticity of a vehicle's identity by examining the data stored in the Blockchain. When Roadside Units securely collect authenticated transactions and message transmission traffic, the integrity of the messages is ensured through the utilization of the lattice-based signcryption algorithm as part of a block. Subsequently, according to the data transmission algorithm, these partial blocks are transformed into complete blocks and disseminated across the entire network. The complete blocks were subsequently mined using a consensus algorithm that incorporated a voting mechanism. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocol is rigorously proven by employing a random oracle model. Finally, the efficiency of the data transmission algorithm was rigorously evaluated under the Barabasi-Albert BA (3) and Erdos-Renyi ER (0,1) models, ensuring its effectiveness in ...",

        "abstract": "Edge devices (e.g., smartphones, tablelet PC, IoT devices) are becoming more prevalent in peopleâs daily lives. With advanced sensors and processors, these devices can create massive data. These data can be used for predictive maintenance, enhancing user experience, increasing productivity, etc. These valuable data allow data producers to sell to consumers directly to generate income. Blockchain and smart-contract technology can be used to ensure transactions to be unmodifiable and undeniable. This paper first proposes a blockchain-based data relay and transaction model for the data producer, relay and consumer in edge computing. We then present a new consensus mechanism Proof-of-Data-Trading (PoDT) by combining Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which enables the proposed blockchain system to reach consensus with low energy consumption for edge devices. Moreover, we develop an approximation algorithm to store encrypted copies of data items on relays with smaller costs. Extensive simulations show that our proposed blockchain system works efficiently in edge computing. It achieves up to 8.19% higher profit for the data producer with the help of relays and consumers using 84.6% less time to get the data item. In addition, the new consensus mechanism consumes 87% less time when compared with the traditional PoW consensus mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is revolutionizing the consumer electronics sector by enabling intelligent interaction and real-time adjustments in consumer electronics products to provide personalized services. Fog computing extends computational services to the network edge, further enhancing the potential of AIoT. However, since fog layer devices dedicate most resources to executing core programs and data transmission, supporting additional security and privacy protections becomes highly challenging. Sharding blockchain, with its unique data-sharing mechanism, facilitates information flow in an open and trustless network, allowing secure and efficient management of large-scale AIoT data. Nevertheless, existing sharding blockchain systems face scalability issues due to low throughput and are susceptible to security risks from malicious attacks, limiting their application in AIoT. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fog computing network architecture based on dynamic sharding blockchain, called FCDSB. The scheme optimizes sharding strategies by establishing a node reputation mechanism to reduce the impact of malicious nodes. The level of malice in the network is assessed by analyzing consensus inconsistencies, which helps determine the sharding boundaries under the current network conditions. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to adaptively optimize system throughput and security levels to meet the evolving network conditions and demands. Simulation results indicate that this scheme significantly improves the scalability of sharding blockchain in AIoT applications while maintaining a high level of security.",

        "abstract": "The surge in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has created a pressing need for Cross-Chain Transaction (CCTx) solutions. Existing solutions either lack sufficient security, like centralized exchanges, or suffer from poor efficiency and scalability, such as atomic swaps. Inspired by the success of the Lightning Network in accelerating Bitcoin transactions, we propose CrossChannel that establishes cross-and-off-chain micropayment channels to achieve efficient and scalable CCTx. Specifically, we analyze the challenges of extending one-chain channels to cross-chain scenarios caused by the separation of blockchains. To overcome these challenges, we employ the chain relay mechanism to synchronize channel-related information across blockchains and construct the channel management protocol on this basis, ensuring the same security level as one-chain channels in cross-chain settings. We prototype CrossChannel between two Ethereum testnets, comparing its transaction efficiency and costs with a typical HTLC-swap scheme. Results demonstrate the significant advancements in efficiency and scalability offered by CrossChannel. Even with channels closing after just 20 transactions, CrossChannel exhibits a fivefold capacity increase for handling CCTxs compared to HTLC swaps.",

        "abstract": "The convergence of blockchain, Metaverse, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) brings transformative digital opportunities alongside challenges like privacy and resource management. Addressing these, we focus on optimizing user connectivity and resource allocation in an NFT-centric and blockchain-enabled Metaverse in this paper. Through user work-offloading, we optimize data tasks, user connection parameters, and server computing frequency division. In the resource allocation phase, we optimize communication-computation resource distributions, including bandwidth, transmit power, and computing frequency. We introduce the trust-cost ratio (TCR), a pivotal measure combining trust scores from usersâ resources and server history with delay and energy costs. This balance ensures sustained user engagement and trust. The DASHF algorithm, central to our approach, encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a novel fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [2]. The most challenging part of DASHF is to rewrite an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via carefully designed transformations, in order to be solved by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Extensive simulations validate the DASHF algorithmâs efficacy, revealing critical insights for enhancing blockchain-Metaverse applications, especially with NFTs.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning method that ensures the privacy and security of participantsâ data by avoiding direct data upload to a central node for training. However, the traditional FL typically applies a star structure with cloud servers as the central aggregator for the model parameters from different terminals, leading to problems such as central failure, malicious tampering and malicious participants, resulting in training errors or system crashes. To address these issues, a permissioned blockchain is used to build a secure and reliable data-sharing platform among participating terminals, replacing the central aggregator in the traditional FL called blockchain-based federated learning. However, the block generation method of the blockchain system may introduce significant latency in the federated learning where distributed model parameters upload randomly, resulting in low efficiency of the federated learning. To overcome this, we propose a block generation strategy that groups terminals and generates a block for each group, which minimizes the latency of a single round of federated learning, and an optimal block generation algorithm that considers data distribution, terminal resources, and network resources is provided. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm can effectively obtain the optimal solution of block generation to minimize the authentication time, and we conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the time efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Energy blockchain applications are becoming inevitable with the transformation of electricity distribution networks into the decentralized Smart Grid 2.0 architecture. The scalability of the blockchain platform plays a key role in catering to the increasing number of nodes connected due to consumer-turned-prosumers being integrated into the distribution grid in a distributed manner. Hence, this study aims to optimize blockchain utilization for Smart Grid 2.0 applications through a novel consensus mechanism, which eliminates the requirement for performing additional complex computations to mine a new block. The algorithm utilizes the grid monitoring process through the existing smart meters, and thus has been capable of reducing the energy footprint for block mining to a fraction of that of the legacy Proof-of-Work algorithm, and reducing the block creation time by ~<60%. The proposed Power Line Monitoring-based Consensus Mechanism (PLMC) algorithm is validated using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT). In addition, data collected while monitoring the network for block mining is utilized for power quality measurement purposes.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology, renowned for its ability to securely store data, hashes, and signatures permanently, faces unprecedented challenges in secure Consumer IoT (CIoT) networks with the advent of quantum computing. This paper proposes a set of robust quantum-based protocols and techniques to address these challenges by enhancing the security, scalability, and reliability of CIoT systems in the face of quantum threats. Updating the blockchain infrastructure is imperative to ensure ongoing security, which involves forks or protocol adjustments to establish new post-quantum chains and addresses, requiring rapid data and asset migration by users. Blockchain guarantees data integrity through an immutable ledger of transactions distributed via cryptographic hashes. The proposed quantum protocols and techniques enhance scalability and reliability and address the unique security needs of both commercial and governmental applications in secure CIoT networks through immersive embedded cyber-physical systems.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach to designing a user-based Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system management connected with the District Energy Management System. By classifying the users into dynamic energy consumption classes to reward energy efficiency and penalize excessive use, users can modify their behavior to pass to a less expensive and more virtuous consumption class. To this aim, a blockchain platform determines the rewards and penalties and, by a K-means clustering algorithm, categorizes users into respective groups. Then, a Class Follower Problem is formulated and solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory network as a predictive model. If the users follow the suggestions proposed by the controller, i.e., the thermostat set-points and the time intervals in which the HVAC system must be switched off or on, the users can be located in a more virtuous consumption class. A case study conducted within an energy district in Bari (Italy) shows how the proposed architectural framework tuned thermal regulation in intelligent buildings while concurrently achieving energy optimization. Note to Practitioners âThis paper addresses the challenge of efficiently managing HVAC systems in smart districts through a novel blockchain-based framework and an optimization strategy solved by an MPC approach. The objective is to incentivize users to optimize their energy consumption by introducing dynamic Consumption Classes that reward energy efficiency and penalize inefficient utilization. For practitioners, this strategy translates to a granular level of energy management that not only adapts to individual behaviors but also aligns with broader sustainability goals. Integrating the blockchain platform ensures a transparent and secure method for managing and recording energy usage. At the same time, adopting MPC with Long Short-Term Memory Networks offers accurate forecasts and adjustments to enha...",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of big data, Federated learning (FL) has found numerous applications, enabling machine learning (ML) on edge devices while preserving privacy. However, FL still faces crucial challenges, such as single point of failure and poisoning attacks, which motivate the integration of blockchain-enabled FL (BeFL). Beyond that, the efficiency issue still limits the further application of BeFL. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized framework: Accelerating Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning with Clustered Clients (ABFLCC), who utilize actual training time for clustering clients to achieve hierarchical FL and solve the single point of failure problem through blockchain. Additionally, the framework clusters edge devices considering their actual training times, which allows for synchronous FL within clusters and asynchronous FL across clusters simultaneously. This approach guarantees that devices with a similar training time have a consistent global model version, improving the stability of the converging process, while the asynchronous learning between clusters enhances the efficiency of convergence. The proposed framework is evaluated through simulations on three real-world public datasets, demonstrating a training efficiency improvement of 30% to 70% in terms of convergence time compared to existing BeFL systems.",

        "abstract": "Combining the supply chain with blockchain provides an immutable and publicly transparent ledger for the supply chain data history, addressing the issue of information asymmetry. Nevertheless, challenges still exist, including privacy leakage in data access and inefficiency in traceability, which hinders the application of blockchain in supply chains. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive access and tracking method for supply chain data based on sharding blockchain. Dividing the participating nodes into different shards enables independent and parallel verification and confirmation of transaction data, which enhances the efficiency and scalability of transaction processing in the supply chain ecosystem. In terms of the privacy level, the on-demand processing method for transaction data is leveraged, and the predicate encryption access control scheme with ciphertext commitment is constructed for the private data, which provides secure and adaptive access to sharding transaction data. Furthermore, a data tracking method is constructed with the trace source contract and Merkle tracking tree, which links upstream and downstream data in the supply chain, enabling the location of relevant tracking data and reducing the time required for data queries, achieving accurate supply chain traceability. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the method is of flexibility and practicality.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the importance of data transmission security and efficiency has become increasingly significant. Traditional consensus mechanisms, particularly the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm, face notable challenges in the context of blockchain-based edge computing due to scalability issues. Specifically, as the number of nodes increases, PBFT experiences high communication complexity, which leads to significant performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel consensus algorithm named ACH-PBFT (Adaptive Clustering Hierarchical) that employs a hierarchical cluster structure and node fault tolerance check to enhance the security and efficiency of blockchain-based edge computing in the IoT. ACH-PBFT adaptively selects an appropriate primary node and forms multiple sub-node clusters, facilitating a more scalable consensus process. The system reduces the probability of malicious nodes becoming primary nodes through mutual verification between the primary node cluster and the sub-cluster consensus. Experimental results indicate that the ACH-PBFT algorithm achieves a 19.83% increase in execution speed, a 23.67% improvement in throughput, and an average reduction of 23.05% in communication overhead compared to a similar double-layer PBFT algorithm lacking hierarchical clustering. In the experiments testing against malicious nodes, the ACH-PBFT algorithm exhibited an average increase of 24.73% in the probability of successfully achieving consensus. Overall, this research provides a practical and effective solution for implementing secure and efficient blockchain-based IoT edge computing using a multi-layer architecture to achieve flexible deployment and efficient resource utilization in edge computing environments.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the decentralization, anonymity, and cross-border capabilities of cryptocurrencies have significantly increased their use in money laundering activities. In an era rigorously regulated by enhanced global anti-money laundering (AML) measures, designing an efficient approach to detect potential money laundering in blockchain is essential. In this research, we present GraphALM, an active learning model based on reinforcement learning, aiming to improve the detection performance of money laundering activities in blockchain transactions. This model addresses the challenge of efficiently sampling training data batches to identify illicit activities within the vast and complex dataset of Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, we have constructed a new Realistic and Demand (RD) Bitcoin dataset, augmented with feature uncertainty, to better simulate real-world scenarios. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and explainability of our proposed model, contributing to the application of active learning strategies in the field of financial regulation within blockchain networks.",

        "abstract": "Layering through cryptocurrency transactions represents a sophisticated mechanism for laundering money within cybercrime circles. This process methodically merges illegal funds into the legitimate financial system. Blockchain technology plays a crucial role in this integration by facilitating the quick and automated dispersal of assets across various digital wallets and exchanges. Machine learning emerges as a powerful tool for analyzing and identifying illicit transactions within Blockchain networks; however, a significant challenge remains in the form of a gap in advanced pattern recognition algorithms. This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based approach called Value-driven-Transactional tracking Analytics for Crypto compliance (VTAC) for the detection of illegal crypto transactions via Blockchain. The approach combines machine learning algorithms with a pre-training process, normalization, model training, and a de-anonymization process to analyze and identify illicit transactions effectively. Experimental evaluations show VTACâs capability to detect illegal transactions with a 97.5% accuracy using the XG Boost model, outperforming existing methods with an accuracy of up to 95.9%. Key performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, consistently exceeded 95%, highlighting VTACâs enhanced precision and reliability. The proposed solution will serve as an advisory framework to help financial crime investigators enhance the detection and reporting of suspicious cryptocurrency transactions in cyberspace.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the primary cause of mortality worldwide. The healthcare sector in India currently shows promise for substantial changes, specifically in the utilization and importance of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Edge computing is necessary to make the IoMT more scalable, portable, reliable, and responsive. Security and privacy concerns impede the development and deployment of IoMT devices. The technology of blockchain can resolve security and privacy concerns. In this work, we implement a lightweight binary neural network (BNN) in a Cortex-M4 microcontroller (MCU) to enable the detection of four different types of heart illnesses present in a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, in addition to proposing a blockchain-enabled HeartCare framework. The end-user can identify ailments and subsequently disseminate ECG results to medical professionals via a privacy-preserving blockchain-enabled framework. To acquire the ECG signal, a reusable fabric electrode was proposed and successfully fabricated. Finally, the BNN model is being trained utilising ECG databases of patients from the Indian continent, in addition to other state-of-the-art databases. The post-deployment validation of the proposed framework was conducted rigorously in alignment with the ACC/AHA Guidelines, resulting in an overall accuracy of 95.93% and a sensitivity of 95.90% for our BNN model.",

        "abstract": "IIoT enables highly automated and intelligent cross-domain communication. Due to varying computational capabilities and security requirements, cross-domain IIoT data sharing involves the design of security protocols using different cryptosystems. Attribute-based searchable encryption enables fine-grained access control and ciphertext retrieval, but existing schemes are primarily designed on a singular cryptosystem, lacking support for searches on heterogeneous ciphertext. Moreover, related schemes still suffer from technical challenges such as the single point bottleneck caused by a single attribute authority, issues with attribute updates, and forward secrecy attacks. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based heterogeneous data privacy sharing (AB-HDPS) scheme for blockchain-assisted IIoT. Attribute-authorized users within a PKI cryptosystem can search ciphertext from data owners in a certificateless cryptosystem. The scheme utilizes multiple authorities to generate attribute keys, employs a white-box traceable mechanism to prevent misuse of attribute keys, and implements subset-cover trees for attribute revocation. Specifically, leveraging the immutability of blockchain, the AB-HDPS scheme supports traceability and auditing of user access. Security analysis shows that the AB-HDPS scheme can resist internal keyword guessing and chosen-plaintext attacks, and it satisfies forward security. Comparative experimental simulations demonstrate that the AB-HDPS scheme with outsourced decryption has satisfactory computational performance, and the performance of the blockchain system within the scheme is commendable.",

        "abstract": "6G (sixth-generation wireless), the successor to 5G cellular technology, operates at higher frequencies than its predecessor and supports significantly greater capacity and markedly reduced latency. Healthcare is treated as a complex system with various stakeholders, like doctors, patients, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies as well as healthcare decision-makers. The innovations in the Internet of Things (IoT) and incorporating emerging technology in the healthcare systems provide the quality of services to the people and save millions of lives. However, patient privacy and secure interchange of medical data from various healthcare providers need to be adequately addressed. Furthermore, incorporating blockchain in the healthcare system helps to make the system more transparent and secure due to inherent properties of the blockchain. In addition, Big Data analytics helps in analyzing large datasets from hundreds of patients, and then in identifying various clusters and correlation among datasets, and also in developing predictive models. In this paper, we aim to propose a new smart contract-based access control for 6G-enabled blockchain assisted in the healthcare system (in short, we call it as SACS). SACS provides a patient to communicate with its healthcare management authority securely and helps to interchange his/her medical information across healthcare providers. A detailed security analysis, experimental results and comparative study assure that the proposed SACS is secure by preventing possible active and passive attacks, and requires less computational and communication costs as compared to those for other relevant competing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, facilitates collaborative training without sharing raw data and holds promise for effective application in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for tasks such as traffic flow prediction and driving behavior analysis. However, the efficiency of FL systems relies on the integrity of the local dataset and the level of user contribution. Vulnerabilities to attacks by malicious users and suboptimal aggregation methods can compromise system performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based FL secure aggregation algorithm to bolster FL robustness. Specifically, in the absence of a centralized trust authority in the IoV, we establish a hierarchical blockchain-empowered IoV reputation management framework that leverages smart contracts to create a trustworthy environment for reputation sharing. Additionally, a lightweight consensus protocol tailored for blockchain efficiency is proposed, thus facilitating a flexible and effective implementation of FL in the IoV. Furthermore, we introduce a reputation-based model selection evaluation scheme and, based on this, a robust FL secure aggregation algorithm. This novel reputation assessment strategy mitigates the effects of interaction uncertainties and integrates a broader spectrum of IoV-specific reputation determinants, thereby enhancing the precision of model selection. The simulation results validate the proposed frameworkâs superiority in terms of robustness, adaptability, and security.",

        "abstract": "The Metaverse is a user-generated virtual world, aiming to provide highly personalized experiences for users. A product personalization design platform is a critical direction for the Metaverseâs future development, enhancing user experience by offering personalized services. Blockchain technology ensures the security and privacy of user data, and enables personalized services through smart contracts, offering opportunities for personalization platforms. However, blockchainâs decentralization can lead to excessive product data, resulting in ineffective data management and optimization, subsequently confusing personalized product design styles, which diminishes user experience. To address these issues, this study proposes the Product Style Automatic Generation System (PSAGS), centered on an image generation unit. The system outputs images with style information based on the input product text, achieving precise quantization and visualization of product styles, thereby enhancing user engagement and loyalty to the Metaverse. The image generation unit, with a standardization module can standardize the product style, namely the relationship between product design elements and user emotions, addressing the problem of managing vast style data due to blockchainâs decentralization. The generation module utilizes a diffusion model enhanced with CLIP to generate style images, deepening the Metaverse experience. Optimizations include dilation convolution in the UNet architecture to enhance image quality. and fine-grained CLIP transformations for improved image and text alignment. Results demonstrate the systemâs effectiveness in streamlining design processes and improving image quality in personalized product design, with wide applications in the Metaverse.",

        "abstract": "Plagiarism in software code and hardware design threatens the open-source movement and the software and hardware industries. It is essential to differentiate between the unethical act of plagiarism and the legitimate use of open-source resources. Existing copyright protection measures, such as license design, inadequately address copyright ownership and protection issues. Furthermore, they fail to detect plagiarism methods for open-source hardware projects, such as circuit location modification. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-based copyright management scheme, which introduces a general originality detection model based on community detection, extracting adjustable granularity digests from code and design files. These digests are stored on a peer-to-peer blockchain, enabling nodes to verify the originality via smart contracts. Additionally, the scheme improves the storage structure, protecting the rights of authors and contributors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and runtime efficiency of the proposed model in extracting digests for blockchain storage while maintaining verification accuracy. The scheme offers enhanced generality, practical performance, and suitability for distributed development and maintenance, with considerable implications for evidence gathering, fostering innovation and integrity.",

        "abstract": "In the coming years, massive amounts of data are likely to be traded in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks to enhance traffic efficiency and safety through vehicular communications. However, several challenges need to be addressed before realizing the full potential of V2G networks. These challenges include the privacy-preservation of users, secure caching, scalability in deep environments, unreliability in high mobility events, and low efficiency in large networks. To overcome these challenges in V2G networks, named data networking (NDN) offers a good solution. It provides a new future Internet architecture: ânamed content-basedâ rather than âhost addresses.â The main focus of NDN in V2G networks is to provide data availability, network performance, data retrieval, and data distribution. However, the presence of NDN in V2G networks introduces several issues like privacy and trust among vehicular nodes. Hence, this article proposes a system model based on blockchain technology in NDN-enabled V2G networks. This model provides secure and fast named content searching and enhances the trust among vehicular nodes. The simulation results show that the block propagation latency of NDN-based blockchain is less than the IP-based blockchain systems. In addition, the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms an existing scheme. The reason is to use the proof-of-authority consensus mechanism compared to proof of work, which uses high mining computation power. Furthermore, the proposed scheme increases the trust and transparency in NDN-enabled V2G networks.",

        "abstract": "Conventional security architectures and models are considered single-network architecture solutions, which assume that devices authenticated within the network are implicitly trusted. However, such an approach is unsuitable for next-generation networks (NGNs). Zero-trust security was introduced to overcome these challenges using context-aware, dynamic, and intelligent authentication schemes. This paper proposes a novel zero-trust blockchain-enabled framework for secure next-generation healthcare communication network (HCN). The proposed framework integrates zero-trust and blockchain to provide a decentralized, secure, and intelligent solution for healthcare communication in NGNs. The system model comprises three components: HCN user identity modeling, blockchain and risk assessment-based access control, and dynamic trust gateway. The user identity modeling component utilizes attribute-based user behavior trajectory features, while the access control component leverages smart contracts-based risk assessment. The dynamic trust gateway component employs a consensus mechanism to achieve dynamic gateway switching and enhance network resilience. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 31% lower calculation delays, 3% higher trust values, and 3% better attack detection accuracy compared to best baseline methods. It also exhibits a 2% improvement in access control granularity and maintains 95% network throughput under various failure scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In the contemporary era, the global proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exceeds 15 billion, serving functions from wearables to smart grid monitoring. These devices frequently manage sensitive data, underscoring the need for secure and reliable IoT networks leveraging blockchain technology. A key innovation of this study is an approach to mitigate vulnerabilities that quantum computing poses to blockchain-based IoT systems, which existing cryptographic methods cannot effectively address. Quantum computers could exploit these weaknesses to compromise key-pair generation and extract private keys from transaction signatures. To overcome this, the research introduces an optimized implementation of the post-quantum digital signature algorithm Dilithium-5, ensuring blockchain security and quantum readiness. These transaction signatures are designed for low-power, cost-effective microcontrollers, such as the ESP32, making the solution accessible for a wide range of IoT devices.

        "abstract": "In the realm of healthcare analytics, preserving the privacy of sensitive data while enabling valuable insights poses a significant challenge. Cryptographic operations play an inevitable role in enhancing healthcare services and ensuring medical data privacy. with more and more migration to blockchain-based healthcare services, strong cryptographic techniques are proposed to overcome the challenges faced. This paper presents a secure framework that integrates privacy preserving parameters, zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), blockchain technology, and a multi-tenant cloud environment. The framework ensures that healthcare records remain protected during analytics computations without exposing raw data using advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zk-SNARKs. The privacy-preserving analytics engine utilizes anonymized healthcare records and generates zk-SNARKs to validate computations. These proofs, integrated into a blockchain network, create a tamper-proof, transparent ledger that ensures secure healthcare transactions. A telemedicine app applies this algorithm, showcasing its practical application and tackling the complex balance between data utility and privacy in healthcare analytics.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain-based distributed Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) has been widely adopted in areas such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to transform traditional data collection methods. However, existing works lack a theory-driven quantitative utility analysis and precise reward and punishment measures that effectively deter malicious behavior. This deficiency hinders the ability to constrain rational participantsâ behavior, thereby compromising the trustworthiness of MCS implementations. To address the issue above, this paper proposes Crowd-BT: A Bilateral Trustworthy ensured scheme for blockchain assisted mobile Crowdsensing. Specifically, Crowd-BT first devises reward and punishment measures based on participantsâ short-term utility analysis for an unrestricted context in the ideal case. Then, for the more practical situation, Crowd-BT designs blacklist punishment measures for participants, ensuring self-containment based on long-term utility analysis. Finally, leveraging the practical blacklist punishment measures and the devised Anonymity Behavior Record Certificate (ABRC) using the blind signature, Crowd-BT details the implementation steps for MCS under the blockchain. Theoretical analysis shows that Crowd-BT achieves both utility and security goals. Extensive experiments illustrate that Crowd-BT effectively constrains participant behavior. Compared to the existing works, it significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MCS.",

        "abstract": "Modern healthcare should include artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for disease identification and monitoring, particularly for chronic conditions, including heart, diabetes, kidney, liver, and thyroid. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), heart, diabetes, and liver diseases (hepatitis B and C and liver cirrhosis) are leading causes of mortality. The prevalence of thyroid and chronic kidney diseases is also increasing. We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature to assess the current state of AI advancement in disease diagnosis and identify areas needing further attention. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and ensemble learning (EL) approaches have gained popularity in recent years due to their excellent results across various medical domains. This study focuses on their application in disease diagnosis and monitoring. We present a framework designed to provide aspiring researchers with a foundational understanding of popular algorithms and their significance in disease identification. Additionally, we highlight the importance of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry for safeguarding patient data confidentiality and privacy. The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain can enhance data security, promote interoperability, and empower patients to control their medical information. By demonstrating the potential of advanced ML methods and blockchain technology to transform healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes, our research contributes to the field of disease diagnostics.",

In this work, we proposed a blockchain-based reliable RPL protocol called reliable-RPL, which uses node reliability, link reliability, and relative trust scores of RPL-enabled IoT devices. The parent selection and network topology formulation are based on the proposed reliability-aware objective function. A lightweight ECC-based scheme performs registration, identification, and authentication of RPL-enabled IoT devices. The consistent topological updates from these authenticated IoT devices are used to secure routing paths in RPL-enabled networks. Using a modified trickle algorithm, we employed a reputation-based trust system that monitors and labels malicious nodes based on their reliable activities. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on integrating Contiki-NG (as fronted for IoT network simulation) and Hyperledger Fabric (as a backend for blockchain-based device authentication and trust-based attack resilience regarding rank, replay, sinkhole, and route poisoning attacks). The experimental evaluation of reliable-RPL has demonstrated its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods regarding significant performance metrics, including packet loss, routing overhead, and throughput on Hyperledger Caliper.",

        "abstract": "As blockchain technology becomes widely adopted in Mobile Internet of Things (MIoT) networks, the growing volume of blockchain data significantly increases storage pressure on peer nodes. Collaborative storage, which distributes blockchain data across nodes in cluster, offers a promising solution. However, the frequent movement of mobile nodes disrupts cluster structures, and existing static solutions fail to address this dynamic nature, rendering them ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Cluster-based Mobile Node Migration Scheme (DCMM), comprising two key components: new cluster selection and block redistribution. The Dynamic Node Synchronization Algorithm (DNSA) optimizes cluster selection, and the Dynamic Block Allocation Algorithm (DBAA) manages efficient block redistribution. Comparative analysis with five baseline approaches shows that DCMM improves performance by over 16.69% in the weighted optimization objective, which considers access costs, migration costs, and dwell times. These results demonstrate that our approach significantly optimizes network costs compared to baseline algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data era, large-scale data analysis necessitates rapid and efficient machine learning techniques. Traditional distributed learning methods often rely on a central server and an online privacy model, which poses challenges for scalability and data privacy. We propose a decentralized high-level Proof-of-Work (HPoW) algorithm to address these issues, leveraging blockchain technology to develop a comprehensive predictive model. Our approach ensures participant data privacy through the implementation of a differential privacy scheme and establishes a secure environment against Byzantine attacks. Furthermore, the training of numerous machine learning models in cloud computing environments can lead to data anomalies, adversely affecting resource allocation and overall system performance. We introduce a cloud computing incentive mechanism designed specifically for distributed machine learning frameworks to mitigate these challenges. We present novel methodologies and provide mathematical proof that our blockchain-based approach significantly enhances the establishment of a Nash equilibrium among participating entities. Finally, we present the machine learning service on the blockchain with the cloud service aiding through in-depth experiments to show how well it works and to conclude on a transparent Nash equilibrium value with an incentive value of 14.3Gwei after a successful session, highlighting our proposed systemâs practical viability and performance benefits.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks(VANETs) have garnered significant attention in the industry, thanks to their distinctive characteristics of mobility and real-time capabilities. In order to protect the privacy of data sharing in VANETs, a privacy computing scheme based on homomorphic encryption and blockchain has been proposed. Firstly, the Paillier algorithm of homomorphic encryption is used to encrypt the data, making it available but not invisible to ensure the security of the data. Secondly, the data structure of a directed acyclic graph(DAG) is applied to replace the chain structure so that it can be processed in parallel and reduce the delay time of transmission confirmation. Finally, a single point cluster is set up in the Bigchain database, and Docker virtual technology is used to simulate the high dynamic and high load environment of VANETs, so as to verify the computational efficiency and security of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the privacy computing scheme combining homomorphic encryption and DAG blockchain not only eliminates the need for repeated encryption and decryption in the communication process but also reduces the computational cost associated with private data. Compared with traditional chain blockchain, this scheme achieves a comprehensive delay reduction of 68.51% and shortens the average confirmation time by 85.73%, effectively meeting the high-performance requirements of VANETs.",

Recent studies showed that modern blockchains perform poorly or lose requests to realistic Decentralized Application (DApp) workloads, impairing the shift towards Web3.\nIn this paper, we present Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB) which handles realistic DApp workloads. Smart Redbelly Blockchain improves blockchain performance with (1) Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction, (2) caching optimizations and (3) fast block execution. SRBB outperforms Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum and Solana when deployed over 5 continents and under the realistic workloads of NASDAQ, Uber and FIFA using the Diablo benchmark suite. Next, we decouple SRBB that improves the peak throughput of SRBB for the NASDAQ workload by 33% and reduces its latency by 20%.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a distributed machine learning framework that enables collaborative model training across multiple data sources without the need to share raw data, thereby preserving data privacy. This framework is particularly well-suited for cross-departmental and cross-enterprise intelligent decision-making in smart manufacturing. However, challenges remain in selecting reliable participants and ensuring the secure transmission of parameters to defend against potential attacks. Malicious participants may upload low-quality data or compromise data privacy during model aggregation. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Reputation Evaluation Blockchain (FREB), which integrates a reputation evaluation mechanism with blockchain technology. By leveraging blockchain, FL tasks are executed through trusted transactions, with smart contracts ensuring transparency and accountability. In contrast to traditional contribution evaluation methods, FREB employs a multi-weight subjective logic model combined with Shapley values to assess participant reliability. Reputation scores are calculated based on factors such as activity, model contribution, stability, and data quality, guiding the selection of participants. Additionally, a PoR-based model aggregation method is implemented, and noise is added to the model parameters to protect sensitive data from potential attacks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that FREB effectively mitigates malicious node attacks and encourages high-quality participants, while maintaining model accuracy and data privacy.",

        "abstract": "The rise of 5G communication technology brings opportunities to traffic-oriented crowdsourcing in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). As vehicles act as workers in many traffic-oriented crowdsourcing systems, there's a growing focus on how to get high-quality reports when some vehicles may be malicious or selfish. Some researchers assign reputation values to vehicles and select high-reputation vehicles to complete tasks, but these efforts still have shortcomings. In model design, guaranteeing the objectivity of reputation calculation, suppressing malicious and selfish behaviors, and maximizing the utilities of honest vehicles and service providers should be considered simultaneously. In system construction, reputation verification service in multi-party intelligent transportation scenarios and reputation management system performance should be satisfied. In this paper, we propose \\mathcal {R}\n-manager, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. Firstly, we design a reputation model that uses confirmed results to update reputation and suppress malicious and selfish behaviors based on reputation deposit forfeit and a tax mechanism. Besides, the model maximizes the utilities of crowdsourcing participants by reaching the game equilibrium. Secondly, we design a reputation management system based on a consortium blockchain to abstract management activities as transactions and verify them by executing smart contracts, which meet multi-party management and reputation verification needs. Moreover, we design a half-committee endorsement strategy to improve system performance. Finally, our model is verified by simulation, and it can better suppress malicious and selfish behaviors compared with three different reputation models. We implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance. \\mathcal {R}\n-manager outperforms two state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes.",

        "abstract": "Due to the mobility of intelligent vehicles, limited performance of communication devices, and distributed deployment, the integrity and authenticity of accessible information cannot be ensured during traditional digital vehicle forensics in the event of a vehicle collision. For this reason, we propose a new attribute-based access control model. Meanwhile, to reduce insurance disputes after a vehicle collision and complicate the investigation of criminal activities by law enforcement, we classify different user behaviors according to the definition of accident rights and responsibilities in real situations based on traditional insurance methods, and provide different renewal discounts for different categories of users respectively based on the incentive mechanism of reputational value creation, to encourage users' participation and reduce insurance disputes. Considering the resource constraints of real communication devices, we implemented a dual channel for converged data and deployed the corresponding smart contracts separately. We use Raspberry Pi simulations to implement resource-constrained light nodes and implement the proposed framework as multiple machines built on multiple devices in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. In addition, we conduct a series of experiments to test the incentives and the performance of the blockchain and verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Comprehensive evaluation and analysis results show that the framework promotes user participation while ensuring the integrity and authenticity of evidence, bridging the gap of user participation in embedded digital forensics.",

        "abstract": "With the development of science and technology, human beings cannot live without electricity. The introduction of smart grid systems brings new ideas to break the shackle of existing electricity systems. This paper proposes a mechanism with data monitoring and sharing capabilities based on the consortium blockchain, realizing comprehensive monitoring of smart devices, and promoting the effective sharing of electrical data in smart grids. When a smart device is out of order, the smart contract connected to it will be triggered, and the users can check the running status through the smart phone. This approach allows nodes in the consortium blockchain to request transactions, using the prepaid payment smart contract with time-lock script to protect the consumer right of request nodes. In addition, we use a (t, n) -threshold secret sharing scheme to realize multiparty sharing of electrical data. Paillier encryption arithmetic is used to guarantee the confidentiality of messages in node transaction.",

        "abstract": "Aviation Internet of Things (AIoT) data sharing can create tremendous value for participants. With the development of AIoT and intelligent civil aviation, data security and privacy protection have become more prominent. To improve the data security and privacy of AIoT, and allow heterogeneous devices to participate in federated training, in this article, a blockchain-based federated knowledge distillation (BFKD) is proposed. First, federated knowledge distillation is used for knowledge transferring between clients to protect client data privacy. Second, a clustering algorithm is used to select aggregated soft labels to enhance Byzantine resistance. Finally, the consortium blockchain validates the data exchange process of federated knowledge distillation. In addition, a federated score grouping practical Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm is proposed for improving consensus efficiency and to encourage participants to contribute more public data and honestly participate in federated training. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that BFKD boasts high data mining performance and communication efficiency while safeguarding data privacy and security.",

        "abstract": "The benefits of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in providing seamless healthcare to the world are at the forefront of technological advancement. However, security concerns of any IoMT systems are high since they threaten to compromise personal information of patients and can even cause health hazards. Researchers are exploring the use of various techniques to ensure a high level of security of IoMT systems. One key concern is that the computing power of any Internet of Things (IoT) device is relatively low, hence mechanisms that require low computational power are appropriate for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this research work, a blockchain IDS coalition is proposed for securing IoMT networks and devices. The blockchain ledger is compact and uses less processing resources. Additionally, the ledger requires less communication overhead. The cryptographic hashes in the suggested architecture ensure complete data secrecy and integrity between parties who are trusted and those who are untrustworthy. Peer-to-peer networks in both central and cluster networks are also included in this work for complete decentralization. The proposed model can counter various attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), anonymity attacks, impersonation attacks, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The proposed method achieved an F1- score as high as 100% and reported an AUC value of over 99%.",

        "abstract": "Multi-signature is a protocol where a set of signatures jointly sign a message so that the final signature is significantly shorter than concatenating individual signatures together. Recently, it finds applications in blockchain, where several users want to jointly authorize a payment through a multi-signature. However, in this setting, there is no centralized authority and it could suffer from a rogue key attack where the attacker can generate his own public keys. Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is desired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as short as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so that both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The advantage of our result is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly secure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes. The first is Schnorr ID. The second is a new lattice-based ID scheme, which via our compiler gives the first regular lattice-based multi-signature scheme with a key-and-signature size independent of the number of signers without a restart during the signing process",

        "abstract": "The air traffic management (ATM) system is an intelligent system, which integrates the ground computer network, airborne network and space satellite (communication and navigation) network by the ground-air data link system. Due to the openness and widely distribution of ATM system, the trust relationship of all parties in the system is pretty complex. At present, public key infrastructure (PKI) based identity authentication method is more and more difficult to meet the growing demand of ATM service. First, through the analysis of the organizational structure and operation mode of ATM system, this paper points out the existing identity authentication security threats in ATM system, and discusses the advantages of adopting blockchain technology in ATM system. Further, we briefly analyze some shortcomings of the current PKI-based authentication system in ATM. Particularly, to address the authentication problem, this paper proposes and presents a trusted ATM Security Authentication Model and authentication protocol based on blockchain. Finally, this paper makes a comprehensive analysis and simulation of the proposed security authentication scheme, and gets the expected effect.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative edge computing is a promising direction to handle the computation intensive tasks in B5G wireless networks. However, edge computing servers (ECSs) from different operators may not trust each other, and thus the incentives for collaboration cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a consortium blockchain enabled collaborative edge computing framework, where users can offload computing tasks to ECSs from different operators. To minimize the total delay of users, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource optimization problem, under the constraint of the computing capability of each ECS. We apply the Tammer decomposition method and heuristic optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, we propose a reputation based node selection approach to facilitate the consensus process, and also consider a completion time based primary node selection to avoid monopolization of certain edge node and enhance the security of the blockchain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the total delay can be reduced by up to 40% compared with the non-cooperative case.",

        "abstract": "The integration of directed acyclic graph (DAG)- based blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) aims at improving the efficiency of data storage. However, if massive IoT data are not placed in an organized way, the search and usage of the data for upper-level applications can be burdensome, since they have to examine the data block by block, which also increases the difficulty of data verification, affecting consensus efficiency. To maintain the high throughput advantage of DAGbased blockchain applied in IoT and improve the data analysis efficiency, we propose a novel consensus mechanism named TidyBlock, including the transaction collation mechanism for block generation and the block selection mechanism for verification. The first mechanism can tidy up scattered transactions before they are packaged into blocks, while the second one can collate blocks to facilitate verification, realizing a two-layer collation of IoT data so as to increase analysis efficiency of upper-level IoT applications. Additionally, the second mechanism can provide a self-driven incentive for rational participants to follow the first one in case they are reluctant to do extra collation work. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the validity of our proposed algorithms by formal methods. Extensive simulations based on synthetic data verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "To address the issues of poor user privacy protection and insecure communication in the Internet of Medical Things(IoMT) environment, we propose a blockchain-based lightweight mutual authentication scheme for the IoMT. Firstly, our scheme is a two-factor authentication scheme that uses certificates and feature information for identity authentication. Secondly, we use elliptic curve cryptography and the Chinese remainder theorem to design a lightweight identity registration and authentication algorithm. This algorithm can aggregate multiple identity information of users for verification, while achieving efficient user identity authentication and ensuring the security of user identity information. Finally, we combined non-fungible tokens (NFT) with user device information, and through a composable NFT solution, we ensured the uniqueness and immutability of user identity information on the blockchain, while facilitating user identity management. The formal security analysis based on AVISPA has proven the security of our scheme. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and storage overhead. We simulated the proposed scheme on the Ethereum platform using the Solidity language and conducted latency and throughput analysis of our smart contracts using the stress testing tool Hyperledger Caliper. The results illustrate the practicality of our scheme.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain sharding over wireless channels (BSoW) is a promising technology to enhance the throughput of blockchain systems by parallelly processing the transactions over multiple shards. Nonetheless, the time-varying characteristic of wireless fading channels may result in unequal transaction processing rates across different shards, which limits the overall system delay. In this letter, we formulate the dynamic resource allocation as a Markov decision process (MDP) that jointly optimizes the bandwidth allocation and block sizes, aiming to minimize the cumulative transaction completion latency for the BSoW network. Each transaction undergoes a two-stage consensus, where it first waits in the transaction queue for member-PBFT consensus, and then waits in the block queue for final-PBFT consensus before being appended to the main chain. Therefore, the reward feedback from the environment is delayed and sparse. Due to the lack of intermediate feedback, the conventional temporal-difference based reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) may not be able to identify the impact of each action on the final reward, which suffers from low learning efficiency. To address this issue, we propose an Hindsight Distribution Correction Estimation (HDICE)-PPO algorithm to effectively learn the credit assignment of sparse reward over intermediate actions for the policy optimization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the average transaction latency by 46% compared with Hindsight Credit Assignment (HCA)-PPO algorithm, and by 72.4% compared with PPO algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Electronic voting plays a crucial role in facilitating democratic and convenient decision-making in people's lives. However, implementing an electronic voting system poses challenges, such as meeting the stringent security requirements for anonymity, fairness, and verifiability. Another concern is the performance degradation when dealing with a large number of voters. In this paper, we propose\nS\n3\nVoting, a blockchain sharding-based e-voting scheme that addresses these challenges. By combining robust security and scalability,\nS\n3\nVoting provides reliable technical support for conducting large-scale elections. Utilizing advanced technologies such as Homomorphic Time-Lock Puzzle (HTLP) and one-time ring signature , the system safeguards voters' privacy and ballot confidentiality. The approach involves dividing voters and miners into smaller shards, and implementing shard managing mechanisms to ensure security and enhance system efficiency. Through thorough security analysis, we demonstrate that\nS\n3\nVoting not only meets the fundamental security requirements of e-voting but also offers verifiability and strong robustness-essential elements for successful large-scale elections. Moreover, experimental results indicate that\nS\n3\nVoting significantly reduces the computational burden on individual miners and minimizes system processing time compared to existing blockchain-based e-voting solutions.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain anonymity has led to more illicit accounts participating in various money laundering transactions. Existing studies typically detect money laundering transactions, known as AML (Anti-money Laundering), through learning transaction features on transaction graphs of transactional blockchains. However, transaction graphs fail to represent the accountsâ social features within transactional organizations. Account graphs reveal such features well, and detecting illicit accounts on account graphs provides a new perspective on AML. For example, it helps uncover illegal transactions whose transaction features are not distinct in transaction graphs, with a loose assumption that illicit accounts are likely involved in illegal transactions. In this paper, we propose a Social Attention Graph Neural Network (SGNN) on account graphs converted from transaction graphs. To detect illicit accounts, SGNN learns the social features on two sub-graphs, a heterogeneous graph and a hypergraph, extracted from the account graph, and fuses these features into account attribute vectors through attention. The experimental results on the Elliptic++ dataset demonstrate SGNN's advances. It outperforms the best baseline by 14.18% in precision, 7.37% in F1 score, 0.96% in accuracy, and 0.64% in recall when detecting illicit accounts on account graphs, as well as detects 20.3% more recall of illegal transactions through these illicit accounts than state-of-the-art methods based on transaction graphs when the mappings between illegal transactions and illicit accounts are provided. Moreover, thanks to social features, SGNN has a novel capability that works under many account scales and activity degrees. We will release our code via Github.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, with the increasing integration of intelligent modules into vehicles, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have increasingly assumed a pivotal role in augmenting driver safety. As an ITS, vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) not only establish a secure traffic environment for users but also provides them with an efficient means of exchanging traffic information. However, during vehicle communication processes, security challenges such as the leakage of vehicle privacy information and tampering with shared task information must be addressed. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized anonymous authentication and secure traffic task information-sharing scheme based on blockchain and zk-SNARK. Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to securely and efficiently store and share task information in a fully decentralized manner. Vehicle users anonymously participate in tasks within VANETs using pseudonym information generated during registration with a trusted authority (TA). Additionally, by employing zk-SNARK to generate zero-knowledge proofs, the validity and integrity of task information can be verified without revealing any private information. Performance comparisons indicate that the proposed scheme enhances the security of vehicle-to-roadside unit (V2R) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications while reducing communication and computational costs.",

        "abstract": "Online auctions, which are widely used on Internet advertising platforms, reduce the participation costs for buyers and sellers, and promote the flow of tens of billions of dollars in the global economy. However, internet advertising platforms tend to be monopolistic and adopt a sealed bidding model. Therefore, when price is the sole determinant of the winner, how to publicly verify the correctness of auction results without disclosing bidding information has become a challenge. To address these issues, we propose a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based sealed-bid auction protocol with public verifiability atop cross-blockchain. Through an approximate comparison algorithm, the proof of the winner consists of m-1 (or 1) homomorphic ciphertexts, significantly reducing communication costs, where m represents the number of bidders. Thus, anyone can check the winnerâs proof and complete the public verification of correctness. Moreover, this paper designs a cross-blockchain auction system model, breaking the monopoly of platforms, and proposes a distributed private key sharing method, which realizes the auditing function of the relay chain. Finally, we formalize the security model, and verify the correctness, public verifiability and privacy of our scheme. The off-chain time overhead and on-chain gas consumption demonstrate the strong practicability of our protocol in large-scale auctions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain-aided Federated Learning (BFL) can achieve decentralized storage and management of model data without relying on a central server. However, security issues caused by deliberate attacks in distributed systems and efficiency issues induced by heterogeneous computing consumption in resource-limited systems need to be urgently addressed in BFL. To address these issues, we propose a Decentralized Reputation Management (DRM) mechanism for a Trustworthy BFL (T-BFL) network, that explores, stores, and utilizes the endogenous reputation of distributed nodes to promote system security and efficiency. The proposed DRM includes three core modules, i.e., decentralized reputation evaluation, reputation-based model aggregation, and reputation-based blockchain consensus. Specifically, in the off-chain phase of T-BFL, the reputation value of each node is evaluated based on model quality, which other peer nodes can verify. This reputation value further determines the weight of global aggregation at each node. In the on-chain phase, the reputation of each node serves as the stake to dynamically adjust its consensus difficulty. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence rate of the T-BFL network under the poisoning attack, and dynamically optimize the energy allocation of local training, consensus, and communications by minimizing the upper bound of the global loss function. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of T-BFL on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Cifar-10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional BFL, T-BFL can achieve up to 56.12% accuracy improvement and 8.6Ã acceleration for reaching the target learning accuracy under the poisoning attack.",

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of smart consumer devices has given rise to the consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), enabling immense data collection and valuable insights for enhancing con-sumer experiences. However, the distributed nature of CIoT sys-tems and the sensitivity of consumer data pose significant chal-lenges in ensuring security, privacy, and zero trust. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating robust federated learning with a main-side blockchain architecture and zero trust principles to enable secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collabo-rative learning in CIoT environments. The proposed system model consists of CIoT devices as side nodes, edge servers as main nodes, and a cloud server for global aggregation. A lightweight privacy-preserving aggregation protocol is designed based on secret shar-ing to protect raw data during local model updates. To enhance the robustness against Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, a resampling-based robust aggregation method is developed, which evaluates the cosine similarity of local updates against a ref-erence gradient securely selected via the main-side blockchain. Ex-periments demonstrate that the proposed framework performs well regarding model accuracy, convergence speed, and resiliency compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs), also known as off-chain networks, implement a common approach to deal with the scalability problem of blockchain networks. They enable users to execute payments without committing them to the blockchain by relying on predefined payment channels. A pair of users can employ a payment even without a direct channel between them, by routing the payment via payment channels involving other intermediate users. Users, together with the channels, form a graph known as the off-chain network topology. The off-chain topology and the payment characteristics affect network performance such as the average number of intermediate users a payment is routed through or the values of transaction fees. In this paper, we study two basic problems in payment channel network design. First, efficiently mapping users to an off-chain topology with a known structure. Second, constructing a topology with a bounded number of channels that can serve users well with associated payments. We design algorithms for both problems while considering several fundamental topologies. We study topology-related real data statistics of Raiden, the off-chain extension for Ethereum as well as of Lightning, the equivalent off-chain layer of Bitcoin. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms for these networks.",

        "abstract": "Modern smart city services necessitate complex technological infrastructure with heterogeneous compute servers, networks, and communication protocols. However, there are many research issues in heterogeneous computing infrastructure for Intelligent transport systems (ITS) when using the services in the network. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to intelligent transportation services and their underlying infrastructure, built on an amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing, and associated technologies. Specifically, this paper investigates the challenging issues of security, processing costs, and communication delays that frequently occur during the communication of data and messages. We propose novel, secure, and cost-effective schemes based on blockchain-assisted homomorphic encryption techniques. A Secure, Cost-Optimal Workload Assignment (SCWA) algorithm and a blockchain scheme made possible by Partially Hashing Homomorphic Encryption and Decryption (PHHE/D) are designed to distribute workload efficiently. We developed a simulator, MOTEL, that simulates the different functions of the proposed schemes and all the necessary components. Using MOTEL and data sets from real transport companies, the proposed approach is tested and evaluated using various experiments. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing solutions, the proposed approach significantly reduces processing costs and delays while maintaining an appropriate level of security in transport services.",

        "abstract": "The e-vote is regarded as a way to express the opinion that the voters ask for. Actually, the e-vote could be applied wildly like questionnaire, survey and feedback. Moreover, the coexistences of efficiency and security as well as transparency and privacy could be considered as building blocks in the e-vote system. The blockchain could provide a public access board to reduce the storage costs for the field consisted of the vote group manager (GM) with its vote assistants (VA). Particularly the k\n-times anonymous authentication ( k\n-TAA) could also be a practical approach to preserve voters' privacy and reduce the computation costs during the vote process. However, the e-vote scheme with pure k\n-TAA strategy could damage either the supervision of voting or the efficiency and consistency of authentication process. What's more, the impacts of dishonest voters couldn't be stopped until the vote end. To tackle these problems, we apply the accumulator technology to add or revoke the voters at any time and extend the framework of k\n-TAA with the update process for the e-vote on blockchain for supervision ( k\n-TEVS). In our scheme, the voter updates his membership witness and proves the fact that he is still a valid member with respective VA under the latest accumulator value. What's more, this witness update operation is not contained in the authentication process, which means that the authentication process is still constant and efficient. Moreover, our add or delete update process with signature of knowledge needs only one pairing operation. For the security, we prove that the relaxed anonymity still holds in the k\n-TEVS framework. Finally, We implement k\n-TEVS scheme, the Emura's work [1] and the Huang's work [2] for comparison. Then we make time cost and communication cost experiments, which present the feasibility and practicality of this scheme",

        "abstract": "Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoVs) is an important information exchange platform to provide comprehensive traffic services by sharing vehicle-aware data. However, traditional data sharing methods can not provide the security of decentralized data sharing, making it possible for some malicious third parties to initiate dishonest behaviors. Additionally, the lack of access control for data sharing in SIoVs easily leads to unauthorized data sharing, thus user privacy is threatened and the source of false data is difficult to be traced. In this paper, we propose a conditional data-sharing privacy-preserving scheme for blockchain-based social internet of vehicles. In our scheme, a lightweight ledger-based blockchain system is designed, which combines with the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption method to realize anonymous one-to-many sharing of data with fine-grained access management. Also, a collaborative identity tracing method is constructed to trace malicious users who provide false data. Our scheme can effectively prevent second-hand data sharing and safeguard user privacy. Moreover, related experimental results validate the efficiency of our scheme.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smartphones have become important to peopleâs everyday usage, especially the number of smartphone shipment has surpassed six billion and is forecast to further grow. The smartphone security is the top priority as people may store various sensitive information on these devices. Currently, phone unlock patterns, e.g., Android unlock patterns, are one of the main protection methods to protect smartphones from unauthorized access. However, many research studies have revealed that cyber-attackers can easily compromise this type of unlock mechanism, i.e., learning the pattern from the touch residue. In this work, we advocate that an additional security layer should be added to enhance the security of Android unlock patterns, and thus develop a touch movement-based unlock mechanism via blockchain-enabled artificial neural networks (ANNs), named BANN-TMGuard, which can examine the biometric features of a userâs touch movement as well as the input pattern. Further, BANN-TMGuard adopts blockchain technology to secure the robustness and reliability when building the ANN models. In the evaluation, we perform a user study with 100 participants in the aspects of authentication accuracy, time consumption and user feedback. As compared with similar schemes, our BANN-TMGuard demonstrates better results and is preferred by most participants in the user study.",

        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is currently confronted with significant security challenges, including the complexities associated with cross-domain device permission management, the risks of privacy breaches during data transmission, and the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized security architectures to various forms of attack. Existing access control schemes are inadequate for addressing the dynamic and intricate nature of industrial environments, often falling short of meeting the IIoT systemâs flexibility, security, and scalability requirements. This paper introduces a novel hybrid access control scheme based on blockchain technology within a cross-domain context to tackle these issues. This approach synergizes the simplicity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with the adaptability offered by Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) while harnessing blockchainâs decentralization, immutability, and transparency to bolster system security, autonomy, and capabilities for cross-domain management. We assessed this schemeâs effectiveness in defending against various threats through comprehensive security analysis. Furthermore, experimental results indicate that our proposed solution provides robust security guarantees and surpasses traditional approaches regarding efficiency and performance. Consequently, the scheme presented herein signifies a substantial innovation in IIoT security practicesâoffering a feasible and reliable solution tailored for complex cross-domain environments.",

        "abstract": "The increased charging demand resulting from the rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs) poses various challenges to the stable operation of the distribution network and smart grid. Due to the stochastic EV charging behaviour, the high charging demand at the charging stations (CSs) elevates the load curve which may lead to a spatially imbalanced load demand. As such, forecasting the highly stochastic EV charging load considering an individual EV's unique charging behaviour can result in maintaining the safe operation of the grid and distribution network. Therefore, in this work, we propose Block-FeDL, a blockchain-based Federated Learning (FL) approach for EV charging load forecasting considering the private and sensitive charging information of each EV user. Thereafter, we use a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model within the FeDL for predicting the EV charging load patterns at each client. Moreover, instead of using a centralized server for global model aggregation, we use blockchain technology, where the model aggregation is performed in a decentralized manner and the local model parameters shared by the FL clients can be validated and securely recorded. Lastly, the results show that the Block-FeDL outperform the second-best baseline method by 95%, 96% and 77% in terms of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) for forecasting the EV charging load.",

        "abstract": "With the swift advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), various technologies have been integrated into wearable medical health devices, improving usersâ awareness of their physical states and enabling the analysis of a greater amount of human data. However, these sensitive pieces of information are prone to tampering or theft during storage and transmission, posing security risks. In this article, we propose a multi-attribute sketch secure data sharing scheme for IoT wearable medical devices based on blockchain (MASS). We introduce a multi-attribute sketch storage method that stores the encrypted hash of health data transmitted by medical wearable devices on the blockchain. This work also designs a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPABE) access control mechanism that effectively addresses the secure sharing of data from wearable medical devices among healthcare professionals. Experimental findings indicate that with the rise in the number of medical health data documents, the costs associated with index generation and search time decrease by 55.3% and 10.83%, respectively. Additionally, as the frequency of data access increases, there is a 13.5% reduction in encryption time, and the implementation of multi-attribute sketches results in a 24.8% and 11.3% reduction in index generation and search times, respectively.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of Federated Learning (FL) in the realm of machine learning for data privacy protection, its unique distributed data processing characteristics have garnered widespread attention. However, the implementation of FL faces many challenges, as achieving a balance between data privacy, model security, and system efficiency is difficult, often requiring the sacrifice of efficiency for privacy and security. Moreover, this process typically assumes the existence of a trusted server for coordination. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a Privacy-preserved and Efficient Federated Learning framework with blockchain (PEFL). PEFL utilizes blockchain and differential privacy techniques to coordinate privacy protection among clients, and filters out anomalous model parameters through an aggregation-side detection algorithm to resist poisoning attacks. Under the assumption of an untrusted server, we design the Model-validated Fault-tolerant Federation (MFF) consensus mechanism based on a committee, balancing efficiency expectations to regulate the server and ensure the reliability of the training process. Through experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and comparison with typical FL schemes, PEFL demonstrates better defense against various attack models. Besides, it achieves higher training efficiency while ensuring privacy security.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain, with its immutability and decentralization, drives innovation in finance and supply chain, but the growing data volume makes storing complete ledger replicas impractical for users, especially in the resource-constrained Internet of Thing (IoT) scenarios. Existing solutions focus on nodes storing only a partial ledger to alleviate storage burdens. Nonetheless, these approaches prioritize storage optimization by minimizing the query cost and lack control over storage cost. Furthermore, these approaches overlook the relationships between network users, thus failing to fully measure the future query cost. Thus, this paper proposes BSSN, a Blockchain Storage technology based on Social Networks. The combined use of storage cost and query cost is introduced for the first time to formulate the Node Allocation Optimization (NAO) problem, and the Multi-population Genetic Ant Colony (MGAC) algorithm will be employed to derive node allocation strategies. Specifically, we address three technical challenges. (i) To predict the transactions that nodes will participate in in the future, we employ the social ties to obtain the access frequencies among users. (ii) To strike a balance between the storage cost and query cost, we jointly model the two costs as a multi-objective optimization problem to formulate the NAO problem. (iii) To solve the NP-hard NAO problem, we use MGAC algorithm, where the storage and query populations collaboratively search for solutions based on four operations. Extensive experiments indicate that compared with existing work, BSSN can reduce the average query cost to 67% with its adjustable storage cost, ensuring a balanced data storage among users.",

        "abstract": "Given their usefulness for evading traceability in networks, it is not surprising that steganographic techniques continue in the modern era and have been looked at through the lens of modern threats and technologies. Among such threats include the linkage of contextual information (associated data) to de-anonymize traffic. Such detection would be fatal to steganographic goals. Cryptographic analyses have expanded to include associated data when analyzing confidentiality and authenticity in channel security; in this work we take a similar approach and extrapolate the security model for steganographic analysis to also account for contextual information. We introduce the security definition of Authenticated Stegotext with Associated Data (ASAD), which captures steganographic properties even when there is contextual information sent alongside the hidden data, and provide a concrete stego-embedding scheme, Authenticated SteGotex with Associated tRansaction Data (ASGARD). Our scheme leverages a blockchain-based channel medium for the transmission of hidden data, namely the Ethereum blockchain. We analyze ASGARD in the ASAD framework and present details on implementation and real-world security considerations.",

        "abstract": "The advent of 6G networks promises transformative advances in communication technologies, ushering in an era of unprecedented connectivity, low-latency communication, and ubiquitous computing. However, one of the key challenges in realizing the full potential of 6G lies in efficiently managing and trading resources across diverse domains in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks (TN-NTN). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-domain resource trading approach that integrates blockchain technology, hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (HMADRL), and multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg games to address this challenge. HMADRL provides an intelligent and adaptable framework for resource requesters and provider agents to learn optimal resource allocation methods in multiple domains. The MLMF Stackelberg game framework represents the strategic interactions between virtual service providers (SPs), network operators, and computing resource providers to enable them to make dynamic resource allocation and pricing decisions. This hierarchical decision-making strategy ensures a structured bargaining mechanism where leaders optimize their revenue by setting resource pricing and followers strategically decide on their resource-buying strategies. In the proposed scheme, the blockchain includes smart contracts that autonomously execute resource trading agreements, ensuring that transactions are tamper-proof and executed according to predefined rules. The proposed method optimizes the systemâs utility by dynamically adjusting the pricing strategy to changing resource demands. The simulation results show that our proposed HMADRL algorithm increases the utility by 19.645%, 33.018%, and 48.791% compared to the modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), MADDPG, and DDPG algorithms, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for crossdomain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain's detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism",

        "abstract": "Data privacy preservation and secure sharing are key technical challenges faced by smart wearable healthcare IoT systems. Blockchain technology enables privacy preservation for medical data through encryption. However, conventional data encryption hampers data analysis and sharing, and decrypted data still carries the risk of leakage. Homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows computation directly on encrypted data without decryption, thus reducing the risk of data leakage during sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preservation and sharing scheme for healthcare IoT data. First, we use an improved homomorphic encryption technique to encrypt and process electronic health records (EHRs), optimizing the modular exponentiation process with a fast exponentiation algorithm, enabling users to efficiently perform data computation and analysis while keeping the data encrypted. Second, we employ symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) to encrypt homomorphic keys and user identity information, and use a Bloom filter as the mapping structure between data keywords and unique identifiers. This approach enhances search efficiency while preserving data privacy, allowing for secure search and analysis on ciphertext. Finally, smart contracts are designed to implement access control during the data-sharing process, increasing the security and transparency of data sharing. Experimental results show that the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme reduces the encryption and decryption time by an average of 34% under different key sizes, while the optimized SSE technique keeps ciphertext retrieval time at a constant level. The proposed scheme provides an effective solution for secure and efficient data analysis and retrieval, ensuring privacy preservation for the secure use and sharing of medical data.",

        "abstract": "As autonomous vehicle development progresses, data security has emerged as a critical concern due to threats emanating from multiple directions. Traditional centralized server-based data sharing approaches no longer suffice due to issues such as personal privacy leaks, location information tampering, and computing and storage loads. In this article, we first discuss key challenges in existing data sharing approaches for autonomous vehicles. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed data sharing approach that combines blockchain, edge computing, and federated learning. Specifically, blockchain is utilized to securely store data from autonomous vehicles across multiple nodes, while edge computing accelerates data processing and analysis, particularly reducing risks associated with data transmission. Federated learning is integrated to preserve privacy by enabling decentralized model training without sharing raw data, thus mitigating privacy concerns inherent in centralized approaches. Afterwards, we present a case study on road segmentation for autonomous vehicles to demonstrate the security benefits of the proposed distributed data sharing approach. We finally identify some future directions on data sharing of autonomous vehicles. Our research provides a feasible solution to the data security challenges facing the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Due to the rising number of Electric Vehicles (EV), the subsequent increase in demand for charging, as well as the long charging time, will make it difficult for drivers to charge their vehicles. Current charging service platforms inform their customers of the charging station information for the network to which they belong. However, they do not ensure the reliability and credibility of information and do not share the charging information of other charging stations. To address this issue, a model in which CSs collaborate for information sharing and charging must be developed. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based integrated charging platform for charging cooperation. Verifier groups for each CS verify the reliability of shared information. We applied the concept of Mobile Charging Stations (MCSs) to help busy CSs, reducing EV charging latency. We also designed a contribution-based incentive distribution process to elicit active CSs' cooperation. We performed a charging scenario simulation and blockchain implementation to demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy. The simulation results showed that the proposed charging scenario with MCS application showed a 46.9 % reduction in waiting time. Also, when the number of verifier members equals the global average of EVs per charging spot, the verification time is approximately 547ms, demonstrating that the proposed model is effective.",

        "abstract": "The lack of privacy-preserving capabilities hinders the further development of blockchains and smart contracts. While numerous privacy solutions have been proposed, limitations persist. Firstly, most existing solutions focus on specific privacy protections such as anonymous payments, private data, or multi-party computation tasks. However, these solutions lack a general privacy ability, allowing users to deploy applications with diverse privacy requirements. Secondly, existing solutions have limited customizability, which means users cannot easily customize and adapt the privacy policies according to their specific demands or preferences. In this paper, we present EtherCloak, which adopts trusted execution environments (TEEs) to achieve a general and customizable privacy policy on account model blockchains, enabling users to conceal any on-chain information. To address the security issues caused by the unreliability of the host the TEE runs on, we design the enclave state check and crash recovery mechanisms and employ them in the block generation process. In addition, we propose an access control mechanism for privacy policy management and data query. We prove that EtherCloak offers general and customizable privacy protection with a minimal increase in transaction size (less than triple) and communication overhead (approximately 10%) compared to Ethereum.",

        "abstract": "Growth in the metaverse has been significant in recent years, aided by the robust communication capacities of the 5G network. Moving into the 6G era, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services are regarded as a potential solution for controlling avatars in the metaverse, because ISAC can enable users to have all-pervasive sensing capabilities at all times without needing additional equipment. However, current research primarily delves into the technological aspects of ISAC under the presumption of these sensing services being handled by centralized entities, such as corporations or organizations, while considerably less attention has been given to the potential issues inherent in such centralized control, including problems of privacy and the risks from monopolies. In light of these gaps, our paper introduces a novel framework for implementing blockchain-based ISAC services in 6G networks. Recognizing the associated challenges and possible risks with our proposed framework, we provide an interactive process featuring appropriate solutions. Moreover, this paper further evaluates the capacity and performance of our theoretical framework through a case simulation based on the real-world distribution of base stations. Furthermore, we conclude the limitations inherent within our proposed blockchain-based ISAC services and provide a list of relevant and consequential future research topics.",

        "abstract": "Taking the uncertainty of wind power generation (WPG) and the specific operation behaviors of trading microgrids into consideration, this paper presents a blockchain-enabled robust-game electricity transaction model in multi-microgrid system (MMS) to obtain the optimal bidding-dispatching strategies, and achieve the transparent and decentralized electricity transaction. Combining blockchain technology and non-cooperative game model, the established MMS electricity transaction architecture provides a complete information game environment for all game microgrids and facilitates the transparent, efficient, orderly, spontaneous management of MMS electricity transaction without intervention of a third trusted party. Based on the distributed transaction architecture, an MMS robust-game model is presented to achieve the optimal day-ahead bidding-dispatching (DA-BD) strategies, in which the individual microgrid two-stage adjustable robust-game bidding-dispatching (ARG-BD) model characterizes the WPG uncertainty by employing the uncertain interval and adjustable robust parameter. Binary expansion method, duality theory, big M method, and column-and-constrain generation algorithm (C&CG) are employed to solve the individual microgrid two-stage ARG-BD model. The alternating robust-game procedure integrating C&CG algorithm and non-cooperative game model is developed to solve the MMS robust-game model. Case studies demonstrate the transparent and decentralized transaction, economic mutual benefits, and solution robustness of the presented method.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new paradigm in smart cities with the potential to provide and manage resources such as computing and storage closer to resourceconstrained smart vehicles (SV) to support ultra-reliable lowlatency communications and knowledge sharing. However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.",

        "abstract": "Connected vehicular cloud computing applies cloud computing to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which can provide road condition monitoring services for intelligent transportation systems. However, it brings new security and efficiency challenges to VANETs. Specifically, malicious vehicles may impersonate legitimate vehicles to tamper with or forge road conditions. Cloud servers are not fully trusted entities, the vehicle information, driver information, as well as road conditions uploaded to the cloud may be leaked to an unauthorized party. Moreover, small devices such as on-board units and roadside units have limited computational resources, and thus require lightweight security mechanisms. To address these challenges, this article proposes a blockchain-assisted road condition monitoring scheme with privacy-preserving. It prevents the leakage of sensitive vehicle identity with pseudonyms, protects the privacy of road conditions through encryption, identifies malicious vehicle impersonation attacks with source authentication, and distinguishes dishonest behaviors of cloud servers with blockchain supervision. Our scheme does not rely on expensive bilinear pairing operations, which significantly reduces the computational overheads. Security analysis shows that our proposal can provide unforgeability of authentication request/response, privacy of road conditions, resistance of reply attacks, anonymity of vehicle, and traceability of malicious vehicles. Performance analysis demonstrates that our work has lower computational and communication costs than other existing schemes",

        "abstract": "In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, data sharing between industrial departments is often utilized to optimize management models and improve decision-making efficiency. To enable secure data sharing, authentication between smart devices is critical. However, existing authentication schemes do not comprehensively consider data anonymity, data traceability, pseudonym management, and flexible revocation of devices, which cannot meet the needs of IIoT systems for security, real-time, and dynamicity. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-assisted lightweight authentication scheme. First, we design a lightweight authentication method based on Okamoto's protocol and elliptic curve cryptography, which achieves fast authentication of smart devices while ensuring data anonymity and traceability. Second, we design a two-level key derivation algorithm and combine it with blockchain technology to address the issue of pseudonym management. Smart devices can generate pseudonyms without requesting them from the key generation center and can be revoked flexibly. Third, security proof and analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the security objectives and is resistant to various common attacks. Finally, the performance evaluation results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the other related schemes regarding computational and communication overheads.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an energy-efficient covert offloading scheme for blockchain-enabled IoT, allowing sensors to upload tasks undetected by adversaries while ensuring satisfaction in paid computation offloading. Covert communication conceals the existence of transmitted signals or links. However, existing schemes primarily rely on artificial noise (AN) or wireless channel uncertainty, resulting in low covert rates for IoT offloading scenarios. Additionally, blockchain-enabled IoT, being value-oriented, necessitates consideration of sensorsâ satisfaction during covert offloading. To tackle these challenges, the proposed scheme combines the adversaryâs channel estimation errors with AN to enhance the covert rate, while also matching sensorsâ satisfaction with the computation resources of mobile edge servers. Notably, a closed-form expression of the average minimum error detection probability is derived to maximize the effective covert rate. Furthermore, an integrated algorithm combining the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm with two bubble sort algorithms is designed to minimize energy consumption. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces energy consumption compared to existing solutions.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a microservice-based architecture to revolutionize how official documents are shared, verified, and stored in digital formats. Addressing the pressing issues of privacy, security, and trust, the proposed solution enables the partial and full sharing of documents while safeguarding sensitive data. The architecture comprises seven core microservices, including a data extractor, document obfuscator, notarization service, and decentralized storage through blockchain and IPFS. By obfuscating designated document fields and utilizing a distributed ledger for notarization, the system ensures both the privacy of users and the transparency required for official verification. Through the combination of state-of-the-art encryption techniques, video-based notarization, and blockchain for immutability, this approach enables secure, scalable, and privacy-conscious document sharing. Detailed guidelines are provided for each microservice, from data extraction and field obfuscation to notarization and decentralized storage. Our approach resolves common issues such as data tampering, unauthorized access, and identity fraud while offering a framework for future innovations in digital notarization.",

        "abstract": "The AI-driven Internet of Things (AIoT) has been widely applied in the field of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for vehicular cooperation. Federated Learning (FL), due to its ability to protect usersâ data privacy, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate real-time decision-making, is widely applied in the augmented intelligence of things for vehicles (AIoV). However, integrating FL with AIoV poses challenges, including the absence of fine-grained access control, insufficient safeguards for FL tasks and vehicle identities, inadequate security for data transmission, and shortcomings in protecting data storage. These vulnerabilities may lead to risks such as vehicle tracking, model information theft, and data tampering. To address these challenges, we propose a privacy preservation mechanism for AIoV via cloud-edge-vehicle hierarchical sharding blockchain. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical anonymous authentication scheme for IoV devices with stronger scalability and higher fault tolerance. Vehicles only know the attributes of each other or which shard they belong to. Secondly, we present a secure FL task assignment scheme for AIoV. Edge nodes utilize attribute-based encryption to deploy fine-grained FL tasks based on vehicle attributes. Only users who meet the attributes can decrypt the content, protecting FL tasks content and participant identities. Thirdly, we present a secure data transmission scheme between AIoV devices to protect the identity and data privacy of both parties, while also achieving non-interactive key agreement. Additionally, we propose a scalable secure data sharing and storage scheme based on hierarchical sharding blockchain, aiming to reduce storage overhead and minimize trust costs.",

        "abstract": "As the artificial intelligence, large model, Metaverse and Web 3.0 develop rapidly, data is being traded constantly. Existing data exchange methods primarily rely on trusted third parties, which compromises fairness and decentralization. Moreover, existing methods often overlook data access control during trading and typically employ a one-to-one model, resulting in high communication and computational overhead. To address these issues, this paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose a blockchain-based secure and fair data trading scheme named FairDT. By leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, FairDT achieves decentralized data trading with high throughput and scalability. Second, we design a fair data exchange mechanism that utilizes commitment schemes, Merkle trees, and other techniques to facilitate dispute resolution with constant on-chain cost when conflicts arise. Third, we incorporate attribute-based encryption to enable fine-grained access control in data trading, thereby reducing the computational burden on data sellers. Finally, we prove that FairDT satisfies access control, fair exchange, completeness, and termination properties. Experimental results on the Ethereum testnet demonstrate that the on-chain cost remains constant, showing that FairDT is highly efficient.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of Big data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices, there is an increasing need to leverage its potential while protecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality. Privacy and confidentiality in big data aims to enable data analysis and machine learning on large-scale datasets without compromising the dataset sensitive information. Usually current big data analytics models either efficiently achieves privacy or confidentiality. In this article, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled secured collaborative machine learning approach that provides privacy and confidentially on large scale datasets generated by IoT devices. Blockchain is used as secured platform to store and access data as well as to provide immutability and traceability. We also propose an efficient approach to obtain robust machine learning model through use of cryptographic techniques and differential privacy in which the data among involved parties is shared in a secured way while maintaining privacy and confidentiality of the data. The experimental evaluation along with security and performance analysis show that the proposed approach provides accuracy and scalability without compromising the privacy and security.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology makes it possible to design robust decentralized federated learning (FL). Minimizing the communication cost and storage consumption incurred is one of the essential challenges. In addition, maintaining the security and privacy of Big Data raises to be a difficult problem. Aiming to tackle these challenges, this paper presents LBFL (a Lightweight Blockchain-based FL framework) that offers three novel features. First, it employs a new committee consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Contribution, which is used to avoid the selection latency from the competition of miners and alleviate the congestion in cross-validation of parameters in an asynchronous fashion. Second, LBFL employs a role-adaptive incentive mechanism to estimate devices' workloads and identify malicious nodes effectively. Third, to cope with the excessive storage overheads incurred in full-replication, LBFL applies a new storage partition mechanism that distributes triple redundant chunks in ReedSolomon coding (RSC) evenly to participating devices with high fault tolerance and recovery efficiency. To evaluate LBFL, empirical studies are performed on the famous MNIST dataset and LBFL is compared with the state-of-the-art FL frameworks. The results demonstrate that LBFL can reduce evaluation latency and storage consumption by 69.2% and 72.1%, respectively, and the learning efficiency of LBFL is higher than the state-ofthe-art methods. In particular, important findings are obtained: the proposed role-adaptive incentive mechanism can properly identify malicious devices and switch the roles of legitimate devices to achieve good decentralization",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to provide convenience services such as traffic flow prediction. However, concerns regarding privacy and security are on the rise as huge amounts of data are aggregated to form large models (LMs). Although federated learning (FL), which trains and updates a model without sharing the actual datasets, has been intensively researched to prevent privacy breaches, there are still potential security threats like a single point of failure and intentional tampering with malicious data. This is because of the vulnerability of a central curator and a lack of authentication. As participants, they (i.e., vehicles) may unintentionally update low-quality data caused by poor wireless connectivity, unstable availability, and insufficient training datasets. They may also intentionally update unreliable data to carry out poisoning attacks. The divergence among local models, trained on non-independent and identically distributed ( non-IID) data, can slow convergence and diminish model accuracy when these models are aggregated. Therefore, it is important to carefully select trustworthy participants. In this paper, we propose a new reliable and secure federated learning for IoV based on decentralized blockchain and reputation management. To cope with a single point of failure, injection of malicious data, and lack of authentication while ensuring privacy and traceability, our scheme combines blockchain and a lightweight digital signature. Moreover, we employ the concept of the reputation of vehicles to select suitable participants with reliability, ultimately improving accuracy. Security analysis results, including comparisons with previous works, prove that the proposed scheme can address security concerns. The results of performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Recently, edge content delivery has been promoted for video applications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networks (UVNs). UAVs could proactively cache (video) contents and transmit them to nearby vehicular users, thereby significantly mitigating delivery latency. However, since UAVs are typically deployed by untrusted third parties, the contents may be illicitly accessed by some curious and even malicious UAVs, compromising users' privacy. Besides, due to the limited resources, UAVs may be unwilling to deliver contents without adequate compensations. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel secure edge content delivery scheme in UVNs. Specifically, we first devise a blockchain-based layered secure edge content delivery framework. With the scalable video coding (SVC) that encodes each content into a base layer and multiple enhancement layers, only the enhancement layers of the content are delivered by UAVs, ensuring that untrusted UAVs without the base layer cannot recover the content to access explicit information. Meanwhile, a lightweight consortium blockchain is utilized to supervise the enhancement layer delivery services of UAVs in a distributed fashion. The delegated proof of stake (DPoS)-based practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm is designed to immutably and traceably record content delivery transactions between UAVs and vehicular users. Then, we formulate the content delivery incentive problem as a Stackelberg game, where UAVs act as game leaders to determine content delivery prices and vehicular users act as game followers to determine the number of required enhancement layers. Afterwards, through game analysis using the backward induction approach, the Stackelberg equilibrium is attained as the solution to the formulated problem, where the optimal strategies of both UAVs and vehicular users are derived by the Q-learning algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that...",

        "abstract": "The advent of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represents a significant evolution in monetary systems, enhancing transparency, efficiency, and resilience in financial transactions. This research presents a comprehensive CBDC framework that integrates centralized databases with decentralized blockchain technology, aimed at strengthening monetary oversight and tackling challenges such as money laundering and financial irregularities. By employing blockchainâs immutable ledger, the proposed system supports secure and transparent digital transactions, thereby fostering trust and accountability in the financial ecosystem. Furthermore, the framework promotes financial inclusion by offering various transaction methods, such as internet-based payments, smart cards, and offline One-Time Password (OTP) systems. This diverse approach helps users in areas with limited internet access, effectively bridging critical gaps in digital accessibility and ensuring that everyone can participate in the digital economy. Through prototype development and empirical evaluation using tools like Ethereum, Geth, and web3.js, the study explores CBDCâs potential for sustainable economic development, offering insights into practical applications and future scalability.",

        "abstract": "Smart farming influences advanced technologies to optimize agricultural procedures, yet it meets significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly in External Intrusion Detection (EID). This article proposes a novel architecture combining Blockchain Technology and Federated Learning (FL) to reinforce the security of Smart Farming Systems (SMS) against external threats. The integration of Blockchain ensures data authentication and transparent data storage, while FL enables collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. Our architecture employs Ensemble Learning (EL) for the Local Model at the Ensemble Layer to train each Smart Landâs data and offers privacy-prevented security. These devices utilize FL techniques to collaboratively train intrusion detection models while preserving the confidentiality of sensitive data. The Aggregated Model completes data aggregation at the Authentication Layer, and the PoAh Consensus Algorithm is leveraged for smart landâs data authentication. The IoT Sensor deviceâs identical information of smart lands is stored at the Macro Base Stations (MBSs). After downloading the aggregated values of the aggregated model, the local model transfers the smart lands information to the Cloud layer for decision-making and decentralized storage. The validation outcomes of the proposed architecture demonstrate excellent performance, with an average processing time of 3.663 secs and 0.9956 accuracy for Smart Land compared to existing frameworks.",

        "abstract": "With the growing popularity of cloud services, companies and individuals outsource images to cloud servers to reduce storage and computing burdens. The images are encrypted before outsourcing for privacy protection. It has become urgent to solve the privacy-preserving image retrieval problem on the cloud. There are three main challenges in this area. First, how can we achieve high retrieval accuracy on the encryption domain? Second, how can we improve efficiency in large-scale encrypted image retrieval? Third, how can we ensure the reliability of the retrieval results? The existing schemes only consider some of these characteristics and the retrieval accuracy is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving large-scale image retrieval framework with vision graph convolutional neural network hashing (ViGH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that is able to address all the above challenges with more advanced accuracy performance. To be specific, cycle-consistent adversarial networks and vision graph convolutional networks (ViG) are utilized to increase retrieval accuracy. By embedding encrypted images into hash codes, we can obtain high retrieval efficiency by Hamming distances. Cloud servers store the hash codes on the blockchain (Ethereum). The retrieval algorithm on the smart contracts and the consensus mechanism of blockchain ensure reliability of the retrieval results. The experimental results on three common datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving image retrieval framework. The reliability of the retrieval results is ensured by the consensus mechanism of blockchain with no need for verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/ViGH .",

        "abstract": "Recently, point clouds have been widely used in computer vision, whereas their collection is time-consuming and expensive. As such, point cloud datasets are the valuable intellectual property of their owners and deserve protection. To detect and prevent unauthorized use of these datasets, especially for commercial or open-sourced ones that cannot be sold again or used commercially without permission, we intend to identify whether a suspicious third-party model is trained on our protected dataset under the black-box setting. We achieve this goal by designing a scalable clean-label backdoor-based dataset watermark for point clouds that ensures both effectiveness and stealthiness. Unlike existing clean-label watermark schemes, which were susceptible to the number of categories, our method can watermark samples from all classes instead of only from the target one. Accordingly, it can still preserve high effectiveness even on large-scale datasets with many classes. Specifically, we perturb selected point clouds with non-target categories in both shape-wise and point-wise manners before inserting trigger patterns without changing their labels. The features of perturbed samples are similar to those of benign samples from the target class. As such, models trained on the watermarked dataset will have a distinctive yet stealthy backdoor behavior, i.e ., misclassifying samples from the target class whenever triggers appear, since the trained DNNs will treat the inserted trigger pattern as a signal to deny predicting the target label. We also design a hypothesis-test-guided dataset ownership verification based on the proposed watermark. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential removal methods.",

        "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) and decision trees (DTs) are both popular models of machine learning, yet coming with mutually exclusive advantages and limitations. To bring the best of the two worlds, a variety of approaches are proposed to integrate NNs and DTs explicitly or implicitly. In this survey, these approaches are organized in a school which we term neural trees (NTs). This survey aims to present a comprehensive review of NTs and explore in detail how they enhance the model interpretability. Our first contribution is a detailed taxonomy of NTs, which characterizes the seamless integration and co-evolution of NNs and DTs. Subsequently, we analyze NTs in terms of their interpretability and performance and suggest potential solutions to the remaining challenges. Finally, this survey concludes with a discussion about other considerations like conditional computation and promising directions toward this field.

        "abstract": "Multi-chiplet system design, by integrating multiple chiplets/dielets within a single package, has emerged as a promising paradigm in the post-Moore era. This paper introduces a novel task mapping algorithm for multi-chiplet many-core systems, addressing the unique challenges posed by intra- and inter-chiplet communications under power and thermal constraints. Traditional task mapping algorithms fail to account for the latency and bandwidth differences between these communications, leading to sub-optimal performance in multi-chiplet systems. Our proposed algorithm employs a two-step process: (1) task assignment to chiplets using binary linear programming, leveraging a totally unimodular constraint matrix, and (2) intra-chiplet mapping that minimizes communication latency while considering both thermal and power constraints. This method strategically positions tasks with extensive inter-chiplet communication near interface nodes and centralizes those with predominant intra-chiplet communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods (DAR and IOA) with a 37.5% and 24.7% reduction in execution time, respectively. Communication latency is also reduced by up to 43.2% and 32.9%, compared to DAR and IOA. These findings affirm that the proposed task mapping algorithm aligns well with the characteristics of multi-chiplet based manycore systems, and thus improves optimal performance.",

        "abstract": "Most RGB-T trackers heavily rely on bottom-up attention and thus overlook top-down cross-modal guidance for learning target features. Consequently, the discriminative power of the learnt target features is weak. To address this issue, we propose a novel RGB-T tracker (called TGTrack) that designs a Top-down Cross-modal Guidance mechanism to learn target features in two stages. In the first stage, our TGTrack effectively generates top-down cross-modal guidance signals with multi-modal encoders-decoders and prior vectors. In the second stage, these signals are transmitted and integrated to improve the discriminative power of our target features by the attention layers of the cross-modal encoders. Moreover, we introduce an Attention-Driven Spatio-Temporal Updater for updating discriminative target features. Through cross-frame attention guidance, it can effectively eliminates irrelevant features within the search region. As a result, our TGTrack can effectively avoid the complex multi-modal fusion modules and thus achieve robust RGB-T tracking. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks (i.e., LasHeR, RGBT234, and RGBT210) demonstrate that our TGTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performances.",

        "abstract": "Many fluid flow problems, such as the porous media, arterial blood flow and tissue fluid, contain sparse complex geometries. Although the lattice Boltzmann method is good at dealing with the complex boundaries, these sparse complex geometries cause the low computational performance and high memory consumption when the graphics processing unit (GPU) is used to accelerate the numerical computation. These problems would be addressed by compact memory layout, sophisticated memory access and enhanced thread utilization. This paper proposes a GPU-based algorithm to improve the lattice Boltzmann simulations with sparse complex geometries. An access pattern for a single set of distribution functions together with a semi-direct addressing is adopted to reduce memory consumption, while a collected structure of arrays is employed to enhance memory access efficiency. Furthermore, an address index array and a node classification coding scheme are employed to improve the GPU thread utilization ratio and reduce the GPU global memory access, respectively. The accuracy and mesh-independence has been verified by the numerical simulations of Poiseuille flow and porous media flow with face-centered filled spheres. The present algorithm has a significantly lower memory consumption than those based on direct or indirect addressing schemes. It improves the computational performance by several times compared to the other algorithms on the common GPU hardware.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular communications have become essential for functional and road safety purposes due to the development of vehicle fleets. However, these communications have made vehicles more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The security of data exchanges in vehicular networks currently relies on a centralized architecture that is responsible for managing various security services such as authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation, real-time misbehavior detection, certificate management and revocation. However, this centralized approach can be challenging and costly for authorities, and it may even weaken the network's overall security. In this paper, we propose a complementary solution that uses a decentralized security framework to help authorities better manage their network security by involving each vehicle in the overall security management. Our framework, TileChain, is blockchain based solution that use road information to manage the network's security dynamically. The architecture is designed to optimize any security service efficiently. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our proposed solution, we selected certificate revocation as a critical service and performed simulations using real vehicle traffic data provided by The French road operator DIR Nord. Our Smart Contract achieved an accuracy of 81.3% in misbehavior detection, leading to certificate revocation. Furthermore, the computation load for security management by authorities potentially reduced by a factor of 96.8%. In summary, our proposed solution, TileChain, offers a promising decentralized approach for managing vehicular network security that can potentially improve the overall security of the network while reducing the computational burden on authorities.",

        "abstract": "Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Stations (CSs) are increasingly prevalent due to the growing adoption of renewable energy. Solar CSsâ main difficulties are energy efficiency, security, traceability, and sustainability. This paper presents a novel blockchain-enabled EV charging framework that addresses these challenges using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the Metamask wallet, and smart contracts. This paper introduces solarcoins, a digital currency for trading solar energy, which reduces human intervention while fostering trust, transparency, and privacy among EV users. The proposed solution ensures secure communication between CS operators and EV users, enhancing both security and traceability. The proposed solution ensures secure communication between CS operators and EV users, enhancing both security and traceability. To quantify the sustainability and efficiency of the proposed system, the framework performances are tested and evaluated by varying numbers and types (Read, Write, Transfer) of transactions using Hyperledger caliper and Go Ethereum. The overhaul Performance metrics were measured under varied transaction rates and control parameters by varying the number of validator nodes (1 node to 5 nodes), such as transaction latency, throughput, resource utilization, and so on. The performance of three major functionsâopen, query, and transferâwas recorded and analyzed. The results show that the query transaction is faster than open and transfer and the latency increases linearly with increased transaction rate. At 1000 TPS, the open function has a latency of 260.22s, whereas the query function has a latency of 104.12s and the transfer function has a latency of 345.73s. The Average memory usage for 1node-clique is 1224.0 MB, while it is 76.8 MB for 5node-clique. Results reveal that with an increase in the number of cliques (Validator CSs), memory utilization decreased linearly. This happens because all framework transactions are distributed across each EV CS...",

        "abstract": "In blockchain networks, transaction latency is crucial for determining the quality of service (QoS). The latency of a transaction is measured as the time between its issuance and its inclusion in a block in the chain. A block proposer often prioritizes transactions with higher fees or transactions from accounts it is associated with, to minimize their latencies. To maintain fairness among transactions, a block proposer is expected to select the included transactions randomly. The random selection might cause some transactions to experience high latency following the variance in the time a transaction waits until it is selected. We suggest an alternative, age-aware approach towards fairness so that transaction priority is increased upon observing a large waiting time. We explain that a challenge with this approach is that the age of a transaction is not absolute due to transaction propagation. Moreover, a node might present its transactions as older to obtain priority. We describe a new technique to enforce a fair block selection while prioritizing transactions that observed high latency. The technique is based on various declaration schemes in which a node declares its pending transactions, providing the ability to validate transaction age. By evaluating the solutions on Ethereum data and synthetic data of various scenarios, we demonstrate the advantages of the approach under realistic conditions and understand its potential impact to maintain fairness and reduce tail latency.",

        "abstract": "With the rising demand for parking spaces, effective management and allocation of parking resources have become increasingly crucial. Traditional Intelligent Transportation Systems often rely on various sensors to gather parking space information, which is then transmitted to centralized servers for data analysis and storage. This approach poses security risks, such as single points of failure and system strain during peak periods due to increased data transmission and processing. Additionally, the surge in user activity can degrade system performance. To address these issues, this paper introduces a parking space search system that records parking information on a blockchain to ensure data integrity and incorporates fine-grained permission management. By utilizing threshold attribute-based encryption, our approach effectively reduces system burden during peak periods. Experimental results show that our system achieves a delay reduction ranging from 22% to 85.6% compared to the current schemes as the number of vehicles increases. These results underscore the practical security and feasibility of our proposed solution.",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of IoT devices, advancements in edge computing, and innovations in AI technology have created an ideal environment for the birth and growth of Edge AI. With the trend towards the Internet of Everything (IoE), the EdgeAI- Human-IoT architectural framework highlights the necessity for efficient data exchange interconnectivity. Ensuring secure data sharing and efficient data storage are pivotal challenges in achieving seamless data interconnection. Owing to its simplicity, ease of deployment, and consensus-reaching capabilities, the RAFT consensus algorithm, which is commonly used in distributed storage, faces limitations as the IoT scale expands. The computational, communication, and storage capabilities of nodes are constraints, and the security of data remains a concern. To address these complex challenges, we introduce the X-RAFT consensus algorithm, which is tailored for blockchain technology. This algorithm enhances system performance and robustness, mitigates the impact of system load, enhances system sustainability, and increases Byzantine fault tolerance. Through analysis and simulations, our proposed solution has been evidenced to provide reliable security and efficient performance.",

        "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) network is the core technology of next-generation communication, providing high-quality, low-latency, and broad connectivity communication services for the digitalization and intelligent transformation of future society. The large-scale, low-latency access demands of 6G devices place higher requirements on authentication services. Traditional authentication and key agreement (AKA) schemes rely on a single home network (HN) server for authentication, making the system vulnerable to security and availability issues if the server experiences a crash or is attacked. Moreover, the limited performance cannot meet the authentication throughput demands of 6G. Therefore, this paper presents the first 6G distributed group authentication scheme, called 6G DGAKA. The scheme is mainly based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol and sharding blockchain to achieve group AKA. Firstly, multiple HN servers form an HN committee, which runs BFT to handle authentication requests, ensuring consistency, liveness, and fault tolerance. Secondly, as the system user number increases, we enhance system throughput and scalability by adding more HN committees as multiple parallel shards to process authentication requests. Thirdly, we design a 6G group authentication protocol to achieve efficient batch authentication of multiple devices, while also enabling mutual authentication among devices within the group and preventing malicious behavior from group leaders. Fourthly, we conduct implementation and evaluation, demonstrating that 6G DGAKA offers excellent forward compatibility, high throughput, low latency, and scalability.",

        "abstract": "In the increasingly digitized world, the privacy and security of sensitive data shared via IoT devices are paramount. Traditional privacy-preserving methods like k-anonymity and ldiversity are becoming outdated due to technological advancements. In addition, data owners often worry about misuse and unauthorized access to their personal information. To address this, we propose a secure data-sharing framework that uses local differential privacy (LDP) within a permissioned blockchain, enhanced by federated learning (FL) in a zero-trust environment. To further protect sensitive data shared by IoT devices, we use the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and cryptographic hash functions to create unique digital fingerprints for files. We mainly evaluate our system based on latency, throughput, privacy accuracy, and transaction efficiency, comparing the performance to a benchmark model. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms its counterpart in terms of latency, throughput, and transaction efficiency. The proposed model achieved a lower average latency of 4.0 seconds compared to the benchmark modelâs 5.3 seconds. In terms of throughput, the proposed model achieved a higher throughput of 10.53 TPS (transactions per second) compared to the benchmark modelâs 8 TPS. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves 85% accuracy, whereas the counterpart achieves only 49%.",

        "abstract": "The advent of sixth-generation (6G) technology is poised to revolutionize connectivity, particularly by enhancing the integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. This advancement offers ultra-fast data transmission, low latency, and high mobility but also brings the challenge of ensuring secure and energy-efficient communication. To solve these challenges, this paper introduces a novel hybrid greylag goose-based optimized clustering (HGGOC) algorithm. It merges the efficiency of greylag goose optimization with the precision of the golden sine strategy. The LÃ©vy flight mechanism guides the algorithm to optimize cluster head selection in 6G-enabled IoMT networks.

        "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a practical paradigm to enable low latency computing offloading for dispersed users in the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. However, severe security and privacy concerns are associated with the open environment between the UAVs and edge computing nodes. In this paper, we address these challenges by integrating blockchain technology into UAV-enabled MEC networks. We present an innovative Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism where the UAV is a primary node and verification nodes are edge computing nodes selected by the reputation mechanism. To enhance mobile users' quality of service (QoS), edge computing resources need to be allocated among UAV and verification nodes. Based on this, we propose the trading mechanism for resource pricing and allocation based on the two-stage Stackelberg differential game. Meanwhile, dynamic states of user demands and verification node reputations are modeled using differential equations as constraints of the objective function at various stages to simulate adaptive service requests for users and incentivize active participation for verification nodes. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed resource trading scheme and demonstrate the equilibrium and convergence status of resource pricing and allocation for edge computing.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in incentive mechanisms for federated learning (FL) is essential to attracting high-quality clients and building a sustainable FL ecosystem. Most existing fairness-aware incentive mechanisms distribute rewards to FL clients by quantifying their contributions to the performance of the global model. Essentially, these mechanisms pursue contribution fairness, namely a constant contribution-reward ratio across FL clients, with an implicit assumption that clients would be satisfied with the contribution fairness. However, research in social psychology has confirmed that this assumption may not hold in many real-world scenarios. According to equity theory proposed by Adams, an individual's assessment and perception of receiving fair treatment significantly depend on the input-outcome ratio, where outcome simply refers to the rewards, while input is far more complex because it involves a bunch of subtle factors such as enthusiasm, experience and tolerance as well as the estimated contributions. Inspired by Adams' equity theory, in this work, we expand the notion of contribution fairness to input fairness and propose a new fairness-aware incentive mechanism named FairReward that distributes rewards under the joint consideration of self-reported inputs and computed contributions. FairReward employs a reputation mechanism to enhance the credibility of self-reported inputs and leverages blockchains to eliminate the need of a trusted FL server and monetarily incentivize/penalize clients. In addition, FairReward adopts techniques including distributed differential privacy and locality-sensitive hashing to address privacy and non-IID issues in FL. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive security and privacy analysis. Finally, we evaluate FairReward through extensive experiments. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FairReward is effective, scalable and attack-resistant, and provides the input fairness required.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of increasingly pervasive smart devices with smart applications has contributed to numerous wireless security vulnerabilities in consumer electronics, which compromises the integrity of the entire network. Attacks frequently involve unauthorized access to inadequate wireless Internet of Things(IoT) based consumer electronic devices, information security lapses, and hence leakage of private and sensitive data occurs. Due to the centralized architecture of IoT networks, data security depends on the ownersâ trust in the entities. With the potential advantages of blockchain technology, a distributed ledger eliminates the limitations of centralized architecture while establishing trust, privacy, and security with assured reliability. This paper proposes a smart contract-based decentralized Selective Ring-Role-based access control framework for real-time health monitoring in consumer electronic networks. The proposed framework incorporates off-chain AI-driven anomaly detection for reduced network load and latency. The experimental results show that the proposed smart contract framework is robust in proving the security and privacy of IoT-based consumer electronic networks with improved anomaly detection over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a transformative technology extensively employed in modern intelligent transportation systems. However, managing trust within the IoV presents significant challenges owing to its decentralized architecture, inclusivity, and widespread network. This paper proposes a novel trust management scheme for IoV that integrates blockchain technology with a pre-reward-penalty incentive mechanism and trust-based consensus algorithm to address the existing issues of security, scalability, and transparency. The proposed scheme establishes a decentralized trust management system that assesses the reliability of vehicle nodes using a combination of initial trust, local trust, and global trust metrics. Furthermore, it introduces an innovative pre-reward-penalty mechanism that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict message authenticity, thereby promoting truthful participation and information sharing among nodes and enhancing the systemâs overall credibility. The trust-based consensus algorithm, supported by the pre-reward-penalty incentive mechanism, ensures data consistency and reliability, thereby improving security and robustness. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in security, scalability, and efficiency compared to conventional trust management approaches. These findings offer a pioneering solution for trust management in IoV, with substantial theoretical implications and practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Secure data access control is widely concerned in Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) to protect consumer rights. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is an ideal solution that supports fine-grained access control. It is a pity that they fail to consider the attribute control and the verifiable legitimacy when consumerâs attributes are updated. Additionally, the existing revocable CP-ABE schemes are unsuitable for resource-constrained consumer electronic devices due to their high computational and storage overhead. This paper proposes a blockchain-based access control scheme with attribute update. A new revocation mechanism is designed to guarantee the forward/backward security of the attribute update. The lightweight ciphertext update protocol is proposed to optimize the computation cost. To realize secure and efficient attribute management, this paper designs the on-chain/off-chain separation storage mode, and proposes the traceability-based attribute set generation and validation algorithm. This paper performs the formal security proof. The experimental results demonstrate that the scheme is efficient in terms of encryption and decryption.",

        "abstract": "In the day-to-day deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), IPv6-over-Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices became significant enablers due to their low power, low range, and effortless connectivity. To overcome the latency during BLE device migration, we have proposed a Blockchain-based resilient pairing and bonding of BLE devices using a lightweight authenticated encryption scheme. The bonding information is stored on the local ledger of the intermediate IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) for BLE (6LoWPAN for BLE or 6LoWBLE) over gateway. Whenever the BLE device migrates from one gateway to another, the bonding information is transferred to the local ledger of the current gateway through the global ledger with the Proof-of-Voting consensus algorithm. The resilience of the proposed authentication scheme is analyzed using BAN logic. In addition, we proposed a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) detection framework using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) due to the escalation of MITM attacks on BLE devices. The DRL-based model is implemented in Python, and its performance is evaluated using the Kitsune Network Attack Dataset. The performance of the overall framework is tested on the Hyperledger Fabric, which results in low latency and a low average pairing time in comparison with existing frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) adds the cognitive engine based on traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which can improve spectrum utilization. However, Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attacks pose a threat to CIoV network security. To ensure the full utilization of spectrum resources and protect PUs transmission, this paper combines blockchain with CIoV to defend against SSDF attacks in the presence of Vehicle Users (VUs) entering and leaving the network. Specifically, this paper introduces a virtual currency called Sencoins serve as credential for VUs to purchase transmission shares. And this paper proposes a reward and punishment mechanism and a hybrid Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining model to thwart the motivation of the VUs to launch SSDF attacks. On this basis, this paper investigates the dynamics of SSDF attack strategy choice of VUs, and uses the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) to determine the critical value of Sencoins that avoids the system to exhibit chaotic behavior. To describe the uncertainty of the population proportion of VUs that choose different attack strategies due to high-speed movement and the VUs entering and leaving the CIoV network, this paper introduces Gaussian white noise into the replication dynamics equation and builds the ItÃ´ stochastic evolutionary game model, and solves it according to the stability judgment theorem of stochastic differential equations and stochastic Taylor expansion. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method can quickly and effectively thwart SSDF attacks in the CIoV network. And compared with traditional methods, the proposed method can improve the efficiency of defending against SSDF attacks by 567% and the average throughput by 25%.",

        "abstract": "The traditional landscape of vehicle lifecycle management systems has several issues, including widespread fraud, opaque processes, and limited accessibility. As a result, there is a need for a paradigm change toward modernized vehicle management techniques, which is connected with the emergence of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). This work is a novel solution in the shape of a Blockchain-Assisted Vehicle State Tracking System that is claimed to transform how automobiles are identified, registered, tracked, and controlled inside an Intelligent Transport System. The proposed model offers a secure, auditable ledger for tracking vehicle states. Incorporating federated learning-based predictive maintenance ensures timely servicing while protecting the privacy of user data. This paper explores the intricate architecture and promising capabilities to not only address the shortcomings of existing frameworks but also promote the evolution towards a seamlessly integrated, technologically driven ecosystem for vehicle management and Intelligent Transport Systems.",

        "abstract": "With the popularity of blockchains, low transaction throughput has become a significant bottleneck in applications such as cryptocurrencies. Payment channel networks (PCNs) have received attention as a way to improve throughput. However, due to the difficulty of predicting future transactions for nodes, the transactions are prone to failure when the channel balances do not meet required conditions. It has been shown that increasing buffers (queues) in PCNs can increase the success rate of transactions and throughput. Nevertheless, there is no effective transaction scheduling strategy in buffers when transaction values are flexible and variable. To solve this problem, we first formulate the Scheduling Problem in PCNs (named PSP), and then prove it is NP-hard. We design a neural network solver based on the Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture and train the solver using the reinforcement learning method. With the solver, we first give two scheduling strategies to maximize transaction throughput, and then design a PCN simulator for performance evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority and various performances of our proposal and illustrate that our proposal can get a significant advantage in terms of the transaction throughput compared to the existing works.",

        "abstract": "The route preference of a consumer plays a vital role in deciding the effectiveness of route recommendations. Accurately analyzing the userâs travel preferences and demands can enhance the personalization and accuracy of travel route recommendations. Hence, an adapted route recommendation model id designed which is utilizing 6G communications for exchanging of data, Blockchain for collection of data at distributed nodes through smart sensors and soft computing methods that make decision for suggesting optimal route. The soft computing method begins by utilizing a Bayesian decision tree structure to obtain classification rules for attribute nodes through case reasoning that is unordered and rule less. These classification rules are then used to determine the busiest routes and demand of the consumers for respective routes. Additionally, the travel route preferences are also determined based on time considerations, and an adaptive route recommendation model is also constructed that emphasis on minimizing the travel costs and consumption of time to reach at the destination. To further enhance the recommendation process, the leapfrog algorithm is devised by adjusting the controllable precision, by incorporating the screening criteria, and by handling abnormal situations on the routes. The improved leapfrog algorithm is applied to solve the recommendation model, which is resulting in the generation of personalized route recommendations. The results prove that the proposed methodology significantly reduces the travel cost by attaining the recommendation accuracy up to 98.6% and outperforms the existing route recommendation models.",

        "abstract": "The importance of vehicular networking technology has grown significantly with advancements in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems over cyber-physical systems (CPS). Due to its open-access environment, vehicular networking presents significant security problems in assuring message reliability and vehicle trustworthiness. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a framework for managing trust in cars for safe transportation in cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). This framework builds on existing blockchain-based trust management systems to address issues with scalability and ineffective consensus approaches. The framework is divided into three modules: message trust evaluation, vehicle trust update, and trust block generation and agreement. The message trust evaluation module evaluates message reliability by taking into account both direct and indirect vehicle trust over T-CPS. This assessment leads to the identification of misleading messages originating from malicious nodes. Within the T-CPS trust update module, the aim is to mitigate any malicious actions vehicles perform successfully by adjusting the level of trust assigned to each vehicle in T-CPS, which is determined by evaluating the messages received and considering the vehicleâs past behaviour. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the framework is confirmed through simulation studies. The experimental results show clear enhancements in scalability and resilience using the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Smart parking services improve parking efficiency, reducing driversâ time and fuel consumption. However, they may expose business secrets and personal information without privacy-preserving, threatening the competitiveness of service providers and user privacy. Although some schemes have attempted to address privacy issues in parking queries, existing schemes may leak query privacy when users query multiple destination information, and are also inefficient. In addition, as parking lot data changes dynamically, most existing parking schemes exhibit inefficiency when handling dynamic data updates, and cannot flexibly respond to frequent status changes. To this end, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving dynamic multi-destination smart parking scheme PDMSP, which can preserve the privacy of parking lots and drivers. It supports efficient one-time multi-destination queries, while preserving the query information. Furthermore, it can perform lightweight dynamic updates. Security analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is secure and efficient, and the scheme can be efficiently updated.",

        "abstract": "There are certain limitations in the conventional methods of native path planning and these methods are not suitable for intelligent or smart vehicles as these methods struggle to consider complex road conditions such as uneven surfaces, bends, pathholes, ruts and cracks, construction zones, and multiple lanes. These constraints are resulting in suboptimal native path planning if conventional native path planning methods are used. In order to overcome these problems, this research is introducing a novel approach which is utilizing the decentralized data collection through Blockchain nodes and also utilizing evolutionary genetic algorithm for designing a native path plan considering multiple constraints and objectives. The multiple factors include start location, dynamic driving information, road conditions and vehicle waiting time on the road due to signals and traffic. To optimize the native path planning, a multi-objective road planning process is designed for smart vehicles which minimize the computational overhead using a multi-step genetic algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm utilizes a fitness function for multi-objective native path planning by selecting the genetic operators carefully. The proposed GA based evolutionary approach efficiently determines the optimal path for smart vehicles. The obtained path nodes are compared against multiple objective and constraints to define the optimal path across all road sections; ultimately this process is yielding a series of nodes that formulate the optimal path. The empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary method with respect to the optimal path planning, convergence speed in attaining the fitness function and negligible training error. This evolutionary approach generates the reasonable native path plans for smart vehicles within a short span of time. The outcome of the research enables the vehicles to reach at their intended destination within a minimal span of time by considerin...",

        "abstract": "Truth and Privacy-preserving service are two key issues for data collection in Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS). However, most of the existing data collection studies use CRH to calculate the truth value, which is difficult to guarantee the data accuracy. The proposed privacy-preserving service methods either neglect the truth-value computation or still adopt the CRH method. To solve the challenge, we propose a Reputation and Privacy-Preserving Service based Truth Data Collection (RPPS-TDC) scheme to achieve the privacy-preserving accurate data collection for MCS. RPPS-TDC scheme consists of two steps: worker trust calculation and reputation-based truth value calculation. Firstly, data requester performs the initial weights calculation on the received data using DBCRH method. Secondly, reputation center uses the initial weights to update the reputation, which is based on the trustworthy worker inference. Finally, the workers are reweighted according to their reputation. We select workers based on trust_MaxHeap, thus obtaining more accurate data. At the same time, we give workers payments based on their trust weights. All the above operations are completed under data encryption, ensuring that only the data requesters have access to the workers' submitted data. The platform consists of mining nodes, and reputation center resides on the blockchain, thus achieving distributed computing which overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional MCS system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RPPS-TDC is effective and outperforms previous strategies in two key performance metrics: data accuracy and compensation rationality allocation.",

        "abstract": "Consumer electronics play a crucial role in the automotive sector by providing the essential hardware infrastructure necessary for developing autonomous vehicles. These vehicles significantly enhance driving comfort and accessibility, particularly benefiting specific populations such as the elderly and individuals with disabilities. Researchers utilize federated learning, employing homomorphic encryption and differential privacy techniques; however, these methods can impede efficiency. Traditional centralized federated learning presents a risk of single points of failure. To address this issue, we propose an authentication protocol for federated learning, integrated with blockchain technology, within consumer electronics-supported autonomous driving environments. This protocol enhances vehicle authentication efficiency while prioritizing data security and user privacy. Formal analysis verifies the integrity of the protocol. Experimental results demonstrate that the communication overhead of our protocol is reduced by 40.3% compared to existing similar authentication protocols.",

        "abstract": "In edge computing, energy-limited distributed edge clients present challenges such as heterogeneity, high energy consumption, and security risks. Traditional blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) struggles to address all three of these challenges simultaneously. This paper proposes a Graph-Partitioning Multi-Granularity Federated Learning method on a consortium blockchain, namely GP-MGFL. To reduce the overall communication overhead, we adopt a balanced graph partitioning algorithm while introducing observer and consensus nodes. This method groups clients to minimize high-cost communications and focuses on the guidance effect within each group, thereby ensuring effective guidance with reduced overhead. To fully leverage heterogeneity, we introduce a cross-granularity guidance mechanism. This mechanism involves fine-granularity models guiding coarse-granularity models to enhance the accuracy of the latter models. We also introduce a credit model to adjust the contribution of models to the global model dynamically and to dynamically select leaders responsible for model aggregation. Finally, we implement a prototype system on real physical hardware and compare it with several baselines. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the GP-MGFL algorithm is 5.6% higher than that of ordinary BFL algorithms. In addition, compared to other grouping methods, such as greedy grouping, the accuracy of the proposed method improves by about 1.5%. In scenarios with malicious clients, the maximum accuracy improvement reaches 11.1%. We also analyze and summarize the impact of grouping and the number of clients on the model, as well as the impact of this method on the inherent security of the blockchain itself",

        "abstract": "The exponential growth of data in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has created opportunities to improve traffic safety and efficiency through data trading. However, establishing trust among highly mobile and resource-constrained vehicles poses significant challenges for effective data trading in IoV. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based data trading scheme (LBDT), which ensures secure and efficient data trading in IoV. We introduce a proof-of-reputation (PoR) consensus mechanism to establish trustworthiness for data trading. Specifically, we use a progressive reputation mechainism to support the PoR consensus. LBDT utilizes a parallel-chain structure for the PoR consensus to minimize communication and storage costs while reducing transaction confirmation latency. Additionally, we adopt a double auction mechanism as an incentivizing strategy to encourage vehicle participation in data trading. We evaluate the performance of LBDT through extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that LBDT is highly effective and secure, achieving a transaction latency of approximately 4 seconds. Moreover, LBDT successfully mitigates communication and storage overheads by over 90%, thus establishing its superiority over state-of-the-art solutions under comparable conditions.",

        "abstract": "Conventional Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) requires replicated state machines to execute deterministic operations only. In practice, numerous applications and scenarios, especially in the era of blockchains, contain various sources of non-determinism. Meanwhile, it is even sometimes desirable to support non-determinism, and replicas still agree on the execution results. Despite decades of research on BFT, we still lack an efficient and easy-to-deploy solution for BFT with non-determinismâ BFT-ND, especially in the asynchronous setting. We revisit the problem of BFT-ND and provide a formal and asynchronous treatment of BFT-ND. In particular, we design and implement Block-ND that insightfully separates the task of agreeing on the order of transactions from the task of agreement on the state: Block-ND allows reusing existing BFT implementations; on top of BFT, we reduce the agreement on the state to multivalued Byzantine agreement (MBA), a somewhat neglected primitive by practical systems. Block-ND is completely asynchronous as long as the underlying BFT is asynchronous. We provide a new MBA construction that is significantly faster than existing MBA constructions. We instantiate Block-ND in both the partially synchronous setting (with PBFT, OSDI 1999) and the purely asynchronous setting (with PACE, CCS 2022). Via a 91-instance WAN deployment on Amazon EC2, we show that Block-ND has only marginal performance degradation compared to conventional BFT.",

Currently, federated learning algorithms assume that all participants are trustworthy and their systems are secure. However, the following problems arise in real-world scenarios: (1) Malicious clients disrupt federated learning through model poisoning and data poisoning attacks. Although some research has proposed secure aggregation methods to solve this problem, most methods have limitations.

Some clients also exhibit free-rider behavior, seeking to cheat the reward system and manipulate global models. Evaluating client contribution and distributing rewards also present challenges.

        "abstract": "Energy trading in distributed microgrids represents an effective means of enhancing the utilization of renewable energy. However, the aggregation of large-scale consumption data may encounter business scalability issues and potential privacy exposure concerns, necessitating the development of novel secure and scalable frameworks for integrating consumption demands between prosumer and microgrid entities. we research focuses on providing a user-friendly transaction model for consumers and microgrid operators. Firstly, a privacy aggregation scheme for user resource requests is designed to ensure the security and decentralization of user data. In addition, the model employs a bidirectional heterogeneous resource allocation mechanism to support the optimal allocation of multiple resources, such as renewable energy, power assets, energy storage devices, and carbon credits, among different microgrids. Finally, a microgrid transaction prototype has been constructed on the Truffle development framework. In this context, smart contracts has been designed to ensure that the transactions are carried out automatically. Experimental results indicate that the scheme provides enhanced security for multi-resource trading in a cluster context relative to existing methodologies. The number of transactions increases linearly with the resource overhead, resulting in more efficient utilization of energy trading. Furthermore, the frameworkâs scalability has been demonstrated through both temporal and spatial considerations.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoTs) networks are evolving day by day as they have been used in almost every field of life in the last few decades. The reason for the increasing trend of IoT networks is due to the increasing population of the world. However, these networks are vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes, which compromise the efficiency of the decision-making process in the IoT network. Many machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques are proposed to solve this issue. Centralized learning is performed in these conventional machine learning techniques due to which the privacy of the network is compromised. Therefore, internal users are not encouraged to share their sensitive information in the network and external users do not want to join and rely on such a trustless environment. To solve these issues, we propose a mechanism in which the distributed model training is performed for detecting malicious nodes. The distributed models are trained and then a unified model is generated at the centralized server. This will not only enhance the accuracy of the unified federated learning model but also preserve the privacy of each cluster because no actual data is sent to fog layer for central model training. We simulate the whole IoT network and for evaluating the performance of our proposed model. The simulation results show that an accuracy of 79% is achieved by our model, indicating that the malicious node is efficiently detected. Furthermore, the precision of our model is 1, which indicates that our model can easily discriminate between the true and false classes.",

        "abstract": "In the backdrop of advancing communication technology and the adoption of decarbonization initiatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading has evolved into a consequential avenue for the reliable utilization of clean energy resources. Most efforts have focused on the design of P2P distributed mechanisms to ensure that the security constraints of the grid can be adhered to. However, ensuring the assurance of the correct operation of the distributed mechanisms is also essential but has received less attention. A common assumption is that all participants in the P2P market are honest and make reasonable bids at market prices. Such an assumption could be risky because the P2P market clearing process relies on a coordination process of market participants and the clearing outcome of the P2P market is susceptible to manipulation by dishonest participants. In this work, we propose a new architecture for the P2P market by adding a verification layer based on zero-knowledge proof technology to identify dishonest bidding information of market participants without collecting their private cost information. In addition, we introduce an asynchronous market mechanism, which can greatly guide the P2P market clearing results in a dishonest environment to be close to the theoretical optimal results. Case studies demonstrate the advantages of our approach in resisting dishonesty, preserving privacy, and enhancing market robustness, which can help build a more credible and resilient P2P market environment.",

        "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is gaining popularity owing to the expansion of mobile devices and internet utilization, enabling cost-effective location-based task completion. However, relying on performing and submitting tasks to specific locations can raise concerns about privacy and task quality, which impacts SC effectiveness. Therefore, protecting workersâ privacy and ensuring high-quality task performance are crucial for trust and satisfaction, consequently, promoting the SC systemâs success. This paper proposes a novel efficient Privacy Protection Task Assignment (ePPTA) model that incorporates centralized and decentralized platforms. This innovative model combines the strengths of centralized efficiency and decentralized privacy, and introduces a unique mechanism that significantly enhances privacy protection and ensures data integrity. Furthermore, the model enhances task performance quality by integrating task and worker constraints to effectively manage the task assignment process. The model was evaluated using a real-world dataset (Gowalla and Yelp), comparing its results with the most related state-of-the-art approaches through comprehensive testing and measuring its performance based on determined metrics. The ePPTA model achieves high utility with the Gowalla dataset, while reaching reasonable results with the Yelp dataset. Furthermore, it demonstrated significantly lower latency in both datasets than state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, the ePPTA model has theoretically demonstrated its capability to prevent task tracking, eavesdropping attacks, and reward-reneging threats from external entities, thereby enhancing SC privacy protection. The results of the performance evaluation confirmed the efficiency of the proposed model, which is highly effective in addressing the identified challenges.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain-based vehicular edge computing (VEC) is regarded as a promising computing paradigm that can enhance the computing capabilities of mobile vehicles while ensuring security during task offloading. However, the blockchain consensus for secure task offloading inevitably increases the communication and computation resource consumption. More importantly, the frequent handover among roadside units during the fast movement of vehicles also raises the communication cost for blockchain consensus. To address these issues, this paper proposes intelligent secure task offloading and caching (ISTOC) scheme for VEC networks. Specifically, we first establish a digital twin-assisted VEC network that migrates the blockchain consensus process from the physical space to the cyber space, supporting the dynamic handover of vehicles. Correspondingly, we propose a lightweight blockchain scheme named diffused delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (d2BFT). Then, aiming at simultaneously reducing the task processing latency and improving the blockchain transaction throughput, we formulate the joint blockchain, communication, computation, and caching (B3C) optimization problem subject to task division, communication bandwidth, computing frequency, cache storage, task deadline, and blockchain stability. Due to the non-convexity of B3C, we transform it into a Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent double actor-critic (MADAC) algorithm in light of the distributed characteristic of blockchain. Through offline training and online execution, we jointly optimize the task division, communication bandwidth, computing frequency and cache storage allocation, block size, and block generation interval for ISTOC. Experimental results show that the proposed MADAC-based ISTOC scheme can stably converge with a much higher reward than the benchmark schemes based on MADDPG, SAC, DDPG, and TD3. The improvement of MADAC-ISTOC over SAC-ISTOC is more than 25.93%.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain sharding is a significant technical area, improving the scalability of blockchain systems. It is regarded as one of the potential solutions that can achieve on-chain scaling, and significantly improve the scalability of blockchains without alleviating the decentralization feature of blockchain. To provide a reference and inspire participation from both the academic and industrial sectors in the area of blockchain sharding, we have researched the state-of-the-art studies published in the past three years. We have also conducted experiments to show the performance of representative sharding protocols such as Monoxide, LBF, Metis, and BrokerChain. We envision the potential challenges and promising future of sharding techniques in terms of the urgent demands of high throughput required by emerging applications such as Web3, Metaverse, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). We hope that this article is helpful to researchers, engineers, and educators, and will inspire subsequent studies in the field of blockchain sharding.",

        "abstract": "The remarkable characteristics of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as high flexibility and real-time data acquisition, make them a promising platform for providing services and applications like data collection and aerial computing. Furthermore, by integrating UAVs with decentralized learning, emerging machine learning (ML)-assisted services (e.g., urban sensing and natural resource exploration) can be enhanced. However, the limited computation and communication resources of UAVs and the potential security risks pose challenges to the reliability and security for distributed learning in UAV swarms. This necessitates suitable learning policy design and continuous supervision throughout the process of decentralized learning. In this article, motivated by the merits of blockchain, we propose a trust-based authentication aided blockchain for distributed learning in UAV swarms, along with a corresponding layered architecture to ensure effectiveness and security. This architecture includes a perception layer, an aerial layer, and a blockchain layer. Moreover, the trust values of UAVs are derived from their behaviors during the decentralized learning process. These values, combined with smart contracts, enable dynamic and robust authentication for UAV swarms. Based on this framework, we present its advantages and exemplified applications. Moreover, the potential challenges related to security and efficiency when applying the proposed framework in wireless networks are also discussed. Additionally, we present a case study on trust-based authentication aided blockchain for distributed learning in UAV swarms. This includes a detailed procedure and solutions to the associated challenges, demonstrating its performance in terms of learning efficiency and security. We finally discuss some open research directions regarding the blockchain-assisted decentralized learning for UAV swarms.",

        "abstract": "The growing consumer interest in product quality and originality has made the drug supply chain management system complex and critical. Moreover, fraudulent activities, such as drug contamination, have become global issues in the drug supply chain. Traditional centralized systems struggle to maintain transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain, often resulting in inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. Here, consumer electronics devices can be integrated with the ecosystem to extend the reach of the drug supply chain. In this paper, a solution for traditional drug supply chain systems is presented by using blockchain technology and Internet of Things (IoT) with a focus on consumer electronics. Here, blockchain supports to store drug records immutably, while keeping information transparent to all entities involved in the network. This proposed scheme is deployed over the Ethereum blockchain network and uses IoT technology to provide the key features of blockchain, such as drug traceability, security, and transparency. Here, smart contracts automate the entire process in the proposed supply chain network, and all the drug batchâs transfer details are stored on the blockchain network. The security analysis and performance analysis of the proposed scheme are performed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme over some existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Reentrancy is one of the most notorious vulnerabilities in smart contracts, resulting in significant digital asset losses. However, many previous works indicate that current Reentrancy detection tools suffer from high false positive rates. Even worse, recent years have witnessed the emergence of new Reentrancy attack patterns fueled by intricate and diverse vulnerability exploit mechanisms. Unfortunately, current tools face a significant limitation in their capacity to adapt and detect these evolving Reentrancy patterns. Consequently, ensuring precise and highly extensible Reentrancy vulnerability detection remains critical challenges for existing tools. To address this issue, we propose a tool named ReEP, designed to reduce the false positives for Reentrancy vulnerability detection. Additionally, ReEP can integrate multiple tools, expanding its capacity for vulnerability detection. It evaluates results from existing tools to verify vulnerability likelihood and reduce false positives. ReEP also offers excellent extensibility, enabling the integration of different detection tools to enhance precision and cover different vulnerability attack patterns. We perform ReEP to eight existing state-of-the-art Reentrancy detection tools. The average precision of these eight tools increased from the original 0.5% to 73% without sacrificing recall. Furthermore, ReEP exhibits robust extensibility. By integrating multiple tools, the precision further improved to a maximum of 83.6%. These results demonstrate that ReEP effectively unites the strengths of existing works, enhances the precision of Reentrancy vulnerability detection tools.",

In this paper, we present a spacetime coordinate system that is based on fractal polytopes in any dimension, utilizing blockchain technology for discrete time and consensus. Furthermore, we define novel network entities and functions that utilize hyperdimensional deterministic switching and routing protocols, as well as blockchain-enabled mutual authentication. In addition to our spacetime network architecture, we devise a multi-tier identity scheme that extends the native Web 3.0 crypto-network-entity to the outer cyber and physical world, including internet infrastructure and future generations of mobile networks, such as 6G. This provides legal compliance with anonymity and linkability to all derived identifiers of entities. By integrating crypto-network entities and novel hyperdimensional space-time networks, we establish a unified, holistic Web 3.0 network that is persistent in both spacetimes and extended to our cyber and physical world.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) offers a promising solution for trustworthy wireless applications by leveraging blockchain and smart contracts. However, the existing literature falls short in addressing the corresponding modeling and theoretical analysis. In this study, we develop effective models to analytically characterize the wireless access process in B-RAN, which also sheds light on other blockchain-based services. We first construct a two-dimensional queuing model and identify both blockchain scalability and RAN capability as two system bottlenecks, and then introduce the matrix analytic method to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. Furthermore, we build tandem queuing models for obtaining tight latency bounds with closed-form expressions. The performance and complexity of the proposed models are evaluated and compared against existing benchmarks to provide a comprehensive perspective. Finally, we present experimental results from a lab-built B-RAN prototype to demonstrate the efficacy of our models.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces security threats from malicious entities that endanger vehicles. However, traditional centralized networks have limitations in scalability, latency, and security. Decentralized blockchain architectures provide an alternative, though conventional blockchains also have restrictions. We develop an architecture based on IOTA's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger tailored to IoV needs to enhance traceability, throughput, and security. The goal is to leverage IOTA's decentralized, high throughput, low latency design to overcome limitations in existing IoV networks. We propose an IOTA-based model using smart contracts for malicious data/user tracing and timing side-channels for attack detection. We adaptively schedule data to optimize throughput based on traffic conditions. Our simulations compare throughput, latency, and attack detection across varied scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the architecture enables automated security via decentralized consensus, avoiding centralized failures. The smart contracts facilitate real-time threat tracing and mitigation. Timing analysis reveals IOTA's ability to identify attacks through latency fluctuations. Optimized data transfer scheduling adapts to congestion levels. Overall, integrating reputation systems, smart contracts, and IOTA's innovations significantly improves security, efficiency, and scalability compared to centralized and blockchain IoV networks. This work advances IoV security by outlining a comprehensive blockchain solution leveraging IOTA's unique capabilities. The decentralized mechanisms enhance traceability and trust while optimizing performance tailored to vehicular demands. This establishes a foundation for reliable and safe autonomous driving through innovations in distributed ledger technology.",

However, they need all data to be public, which may be unacceptable for use cases such as biometric data processing or sensitive monetary transactions. Therefore, confidentiality is identified as a need in blockchain. Additionally, blockchain can contribute to confidential applications by providing publicly verifiable mechanisms, therefore enhancing security. This work presents a framework for cost-effective and publicly verifiable confidential computations in blockchain, by relying on secure multi-party computation committees and zero-knowledge proofs. Our framework supports arbitrary computations on confidential data enforced by smart contracts. Additionally, staking, incentives, and cheat identification are provided as solutions to enhance trust. We also provide a technical solution to embed secure multi-party computations within smart contracts by using the Promise programming pattern. Finally, a cost analysis is provided to justify the feasibility of the framework compared to other solutions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology, known for its immutable distributed ledger, which greatly improves the credibility of data management in various applications. However, the immutability may result in erroneous data being permanently stored in the blockchain, affecting the security of the blockchain system. To address this issue, redactable blockchain is proposed to allow flexibly modifications of erroneous data in blockchain. Despite their promise, current redactable blockchain solutions often fall short in balancing two critical aspects: decentralization and data accountability. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized, Accountable and Redactable Blockchain solution (DARB). Our solution aims to mitigate the risks associated with central authority while ensuring secure accountability in data modification processes. Decentralization is achieved by using authorized authorities instead of the central authority, utilizing decentralized ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption. Additionally, it incorporates traceable ring signatures, which enable the authorized authorities to collaborate effectively in holding edited data accountable and tracing the identity of malicious modifiers. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the DARB scheme successfully facilitates secure data rewriting and ensures accountability, all while maintaining an acceptable level of additional time overhead.",

        "abstract": "The rich motion and appearance cues between consecutive frames are crucial for robust visual tracking. However, most existing tracking methods are still limited in designing different components to separately employ corresponding cues and even ignore one of them. This makes them difficult to maintain effective interaction between different cues, thus hindering the models from fostering a comprehensive understanding of the target objects. To address these issues, we propose a unified spatio-temporal cues learning framework (named USCLTrack) that comprehensively mines the variation patterns of targets between consecutive frames in complex video streams. Specifically, USCLTrack firstly aggregates motion and appearance cues into shared queries to provide the bridge of interaction between both cues. Then, it directly generates object locations on the condition of these shared queries in an autoregressive manner, unifying different cues to guide future inferences. To effectively learn multiple spatio-temporal cues aggregated in the shared queries, we develop a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. This mechanism integrates motion cues with appearance cues according to the time steps for ensuring temporal consistency. Moreover, it concurrently captures motion trends and appearance changes to facilitate the understanding of the target objects. Extensive experiments on eight popular tracking benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed USCLTrack.",

        "abstract": "The deep vision sensing has been a practical tool in early disease detection, and this work aims at an important branch of ocular disease recognition. Although a number of researchers had paid attention to it during past years, fine-grained ocular feature extraction always remains a challenge. To handle with this issue, this work benefits from comprehensive ability of the convolution-Transformer structure (Conformer), and proposes vision sensing-driven intelligent ocular disease detection using conformer-based dual fusion. On the one hand, the proposal combines technical advantages of convolution and visual Transformer to more accurately fuse local subtle features and global representation information in images. On the other hand, the proposal significantly improves accuracy and robustness of the model by optimizing depth and width. Simulation experiments on real-world ocular disease image datasets show that the proposed model exhibits higher performance in ocular disease detection compared to other methods. Numerical results show that it improves the detection accuracy by 1% to 3.7% compared to several mainstream baseline methods. This research result not only promotes the development of ocular disease detection, but also provides more reliable technical support for accurate diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Despite narrow beams with strong anti-interception capabilities, terahertz communications still face eavesdropping risks in short-range indoor networks. This paper investigates physical-layer security of downlink terahertz communications for indoor three-dimensional (3D) networks comprised of a large number of access points (APs), users, human blockages, and eavesdroppers. We propose two different artificial noise (AN)-assisted terahertz secure transmission schemes, namely the full-AN (F-AN) scheme and partial-AN (P-AN) scheme, under the nearest line-of-sight association (NLA) strategy. The F-AN scheme involves full APs emitting AN to deteriorate the reception of eavesdroppers, and the P-AN scheme selects only those APs with blocked links to the typical user to emit AN based on the unique blocking feature of terahertz. We first obtain the expression for association probability. Then, we determine the eavesdropping region covered by the 3D beam on the ground. We derive the connection outage probability and secrecy outage probability for the two schemes by calculating the Laplace transform of aggregate interference. Our results provide interesting insights into how the secrecy performance is influenced by various system parameters, including the densities of APs and blockages. Moreover, we show that the P-AN scheme outperforms the F-AN scheme regarding the average number of perfect links per unit area.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) realizes distributed machine learning training via sharing model updates rather than raw data, thus ensuring data privacy. However, an attacker may infer the client's local original data from the model parameter so that original data leakage can be caused. While Differential Privacy (DP) is designed to address data leakage issues in FL, injecting noises during training reduces model accuracy. To minimize the negative impact caused by noises on model accuracy while considering privacy protections, in this paper we propose an adaptive FL model, entitled R DP-based A daptive F ederated L earning in S huffle model (RAFLS). To ensure the dataset privacy of clients, we inject adaptive noises into the client's local model by leveraging the adaptive layer- wise adaptive sensitivity of the local model. Our approach shuffles all local model parameters in order to address privacy explosion concerns caused by high-dimensional aggregation and multiple iterations. We further propose a fine-grained model weight aggregation scheme to aggregate all local models and obtain a global model. Our experiment evaluations demonstrate the proposed RAFLS has a better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in reducing noise's impact on model accuracy while protecting data, i.e., showing that the accuracy of RAFLS increases by 1.54% than that of the baseline scheme when\nÏµ=2.0\nand FashionMNIST under IID setting.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the service path problem of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) providing communication services to multi-user in urban environments with limited endurance. Our goal is to learn an optimal multi-UAV centralized control policy that will enable UAVs to find the illumination areas in urban environments through curiosity-driven exploration and harvest energy to continue providing communication services to users. Firstly, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-UAV centralized control strategy to maximize the accumulated communication service score. In the proposed framework, curiosity can act as an internal incentive signal, allowing UAVs to explore the environment without any prior knowledge. Secondly, a two-phase exploring protocol is proposed for practical implementation. Compared to the baseline method, our proposed method can achieve a significantly higher accumulated communication service score in the exploitation-intensive phase. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain accurate service paths over the baseline method and handle the Exploration-Exploitation trade-off well.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, device-free passive localization leveraging Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a prominent technique for indoor positioning, yet the nonlinear interactions and signal superposition among multiple targets, coupled with occlusion and shadowing effects, significantly complicate the localization task, rendering multi-target device-free passive localization a substantial challenge in the field. In this paper, we propose a novel device-free passive multi-target indoor localization approach based on multi-label learning and unsupervised domain adaptation, denoted as MLDA-MultiLoc. It segments the localization area into multiple training point regions, reformulating the multi-target problem as a multi-label classification task. MLDA-MultiLoc employs a fusion representation model that capitalizes on the spatio-temporal redundancy of CSI amplitude and phase, effectively mapping these features into a unified representation domain. This model is optimized to enhance the discriminative power of the fusion fingerprint (HDFF) by maximizing spatial metrics. Acknowledging the nonlinear influence of multiple targets on CSI, MLDA-MultiLoc incorporates a Fusion Generation Network to synthesize multi-target fingerprints from multiple single-target fingerprints, creating virtual samples for multi-target scenarios. This process facilitates the training of a deep learning-based multi-label classifier, leveraging multi-label learning for robust parameter optimization. Furthermore, MLDA-MultiLoc introduces an unsupervised domain adaptation technique that utilizes a meta-learning dual-stream structure. This method effectively bridges the gap between virtual and real fingerprint samples, ensuring accurate multi-target localization in complex, dynamic indoor settings. Extensive experiments have confirmed the superiority of MLDA-MultiLoc over existing state-of-the-art systems, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "In the control of discrete-event systems for current-state opacity enforcement, it is difficult to synthesize a supervisor by supervisory control theory (SCT) without explicit formal models of the systems. This study utilizes the reinforcement learning (RL) method to obtain supervisory policies for opacity enforcement in the case when the automaton model of the system is unavailable. The state space of the environment in the RL is dynamically generated through system simulation. Actions are defined according to the control patterns of the SCT. A reward function is proposed to evaluate whether the secret is exposed or not. Then, a sequence of state-action-reward chains are obtained as system simulation goes on. The frameworks of Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms are adopted to implement the proposed approach. The goal of the training is to maximize the total accumulative reward by optimizing the action selection in the learning process. Then, an optimal supervisory policy is obtained when the training process converges. Experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions are two aspects. Firstly, a supervisor for opacity enforcement is learned by RL training without an explicit formal model of the system. Secondly, the ability of the proposed method in computing supervisory policies without formal models addresses a significant gap in the literature and offers a new direction for research in opacity enforcement in discrete event systems. Note to Practitioners âSupervisory Control Theory (SCT) supplies an effective way to synthesize supervisors, which traditionally handles tasks with explicit system models for current-state opacity enforcement by restricting behavior of systems. However, formal models of systems are often confidential or otherwise unavailable. This paper presents a method for supervisor synthesis via reinforcement learning in the case of lacking formal models of system...",

        "abstract": "A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is proposed, where two energy-limited devices first harvest energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then use that energy to transmit information back. To fully eliminate the doubly-near-far effect in WPCNs, two STAR-RIS operating protocol-driven transmission strategies, namely energy splitting non-orthogonal multiple access (ESNOMA) and time switching time division multiple access (TSTDMA) are proposed. For each strategy, the corresponding optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum throughput by jointly optimizing time allocation, user transmit power, active HAP beamforming, and passive STAR-RIS beamforming. For ES-NOMA, the resulting intractable problem is solved via a two-layer algorithm, which exploits the one-dimensional search and block coordinate descent methods in an iterative manner. For TS-TDMA, the optimal active beamforming and passive beamforming are first determined according to the maximum-ratio transmission beamformer. Then, the optimal solution of the time allocation variables is obtained by solving a standard convex problem. Numerical results show that: 1) the STAR-RIS can achieve considerable performance improvements for both strategies compared to the conventional RIS; 2) TSTDMA is preferred for single-antenna scenarios, whereas ESNOMA is better suited for multi-antenna scenarios; and 3) the superiority of ES-NOMA over TS-TDMA is enhanced as the number of STAR-RIS elements increases.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, e-voting has been widely used in all aspects of peopleâs lives. However, there is a common problem in the vast majority of e-voting solutions: the inability to complete vote counting without a trusted third-party organization, which may lead to security risks. When designing an e-voting system, ensuring the trustworthiness of the voting results as well as protecting the privacy of the voters are always the most important issues. To address this challenge, we propose ISE-Voting, an Improved Secure and Efficient (ISE) evoting scheme for blockchain-assisted IoT devices. Our proposed ISE-Voting achieves voter privacy anonymity, distributed vote counting, and public verifiability of counting results in e-voting systems by using secret-sharing and identity-based ring signatures in the blockchain system. In addition, we introduce a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), which is used to share the computational pressure of the system and assist ISE-Voting to complete the final counting. According to the experimental analysis and results, our scheme is not only able to meet the basic security goals of satisfying correctness, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability, and provide 128-bit identity security for the voters in the post-quantum environment. Moreover, it can complete the distributed counting of votersâ ballots within an effective time, which provides a feasible solution for future e-voting systems.",

        "abstract": "To achieve fine-grained access control and address the data silos challenge in data sharing, the integration of blockchain with attribute-based encryption emerges as a promising solution. Nowadays, the growing interconnectedness among diverse blockchain applications has spurred the need for efficient cross-chain data sharing. However, existing single-authority attribute-based data sharing schemes are not suitable for such cross-chain scenarios involving multiple attribute authorities. Moreover, the frequent requirement for data owners to process cross-chain data requests significantly hampers practicality. In this context, we introduce a novel multi-authority attribute-based proxy re-encryption scheme that enables ciphertext policy updating and supports secure and efficient cross-chain data sharing. By introducing a proxy, the data owner is empowered to delegate access without leaking any valid information and flexibly sells data across blockchains through cross-chain access policies. Besides, our scheme leverages the relay chain to foster a decentralized and trustworthy ecosystem. The adoption of smart contracts automates the cross-chain data sharing process and ensures equitable distribution of benefits among participants. Additionally, our scheme integrates hybrid encryption with the decentralized data hosting platform, substantially mitigating the on-chain storage burden. Security analysis affirms that our scheme is semantically secure and resistant to collusion attack. Performance analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the excellent efficiency and practicality of our scheme when conducting cross-chain data sharing.",

        "abstract": "As Blockchain and Cloud computing are becoming more prevalent, the ability to adapt and maintain stability in virtual networks becomes increasingly important for socio-economic systems. The dynamic nature of VNF (virtual network functionality), which can be moved, replicated, or deleted based on network demands, requires efficient and effective algorithms for VNF adaptation and smoother functionality of socio-economic systems. Based on this, the study proposes the Migration Cost and Network Energy Consumption (MJOVME) algorithm for virtual network function adaptation based on bandwidth and other required resources, and proves its effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the weighting factor value lies between 0.12 and 0.22 whereas the network energy loss shows diminishing trend under different bandwidths, while the migration cost loss is exhibiting an upward trend. The integration of VNF with Cloud and Blockchain environments leads to enhanced security, data integrity, scalability, and decentralized distributed management for socio-economic systems. As the number of SFC (service function chain) requests increases, the network energy loss of the MJOVME algorithm lies within 200 1200 migration cost as compared with the algorithm considered for comparative study which is approximately 0.2W104W higher than MJOVME. The MJOVME algorithm has attained an average resource utilization rate of 69.50% and a memory resource utilization rate of 66.78% which is commendable in integrated environment. The standard deviation of computing resources is 12.41% and the standard deviation of memory resources is 15.08%, lower than the comparative method. The proposed MJOVME algorithm has high effectiveness in adaptive migration of virtual network functions in integrated environment of Cloud and Blockchain and is of great significance for VNF migration when actual resource requirements are altered.",

        "abstract": "Natural or man-made disasters pose significant challenges for delivering critical relief to affected populations due to disruptions in critical infrastructures and logistics networks. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided disaster relief networks (UDRNs) leverage UAVs to assist existing ground relief networks by swiftly assessing affected areas, and timely delivering lifesaving supplies. To meet the growing demands for collaborative, trust-free, and transparent UDRN services, blockchain-based UDRNs emerge as a promising approach through immutable ledgers and distributed smart contracts. However, several efficiency and security challenges hinder the deployment of blockchain-based UDRNs, including the lack of cooperation between smart contracts, lack of dynamic audit for smart contract vulnerabilities, and low forensics robustness against transaction malleability attacks. Toward efficient and secure blockchain- based UDRNs, this article presents potential solutions: a series of collaborative smart contracts for coordinated relief management; a dynamic contract audit mechanism to prevent known/unknown contract vulnerabilities; and a robust transaction forensics strategy with on/off-chain cooperation to resist transaction malleability attacks. Our prototype implementation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, we outline key open research issues crucial to advancing this emerging field.",

        "abstract": "The robust subgroup multisignature allows any subgroup of signers to generate a multisignature on behalf of the whole group, which can be flexibly applied in many blockchain consensus mechanisms. Unlike the security model of traditional subgroup multisignatures, robustness can prevent dishonest signers from joining a subgroup by checking each individual signature before combining. To enhance the robustness of subgroup multisignatures, we utilize an on-chain smart contract instead of an off-chain combiner to check each individual signature. We propose a blockchain-assisted robust subgroup ECDSA multisignature scheme and prove its robustness and unforgeability. Since the ECDSA signature is the most popular signature used for blockchains and some blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, already have a precompiled contract for the verification of the ECDSA, the on-chain costs for each single ECDSA signature are very low. Experiments show that our blockchain-assisted subgroup ECDSA multisignature has efficient on-chain costs. On the other hand, multiplicative-to-additive (MtA) protocols are used in the construction of subgroup multisignatures, which results in increased communication and computational costs. We use two popular additive homomorphic encryption scheme (Paillier and CL)-based MtA protocols to construct our scheme and test its performance. Finally, we apply our scheme in a consensus mechanism of a distributed blockchain interoperability oracle.",

        "abstract": "With the development of digital twin (DT) technology, the DT network (DTN) has emerged to represent virtually the physical network by building physical entities as interactive DT models. However, the DTN faces the challenge of privacy leakage due to the collection of private data in the DT model building process. Additionally, massive data uploaded to the DTN for centralized processing leads to security issues of single-point failure and poisoning attacks. In this article, we propose blockchain- enabled secure federated learning (FL) for constructing a decentralized and privacy-preserving DTN. Specifically, we utilize the FL paradigm and homomorphic encryption method to locally build DT models at the ciphertext level. Then, we propose integrating blockchain into FL to construct a decentralized architecture for the DTN to avoid single-point failure. Moreover, we devise the proof-of-gradient consensus mechanism to facilitate trusted interactions among DT models to resist poisoning attacks. Finally, the security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes.",

        "abstract": "With the surging magnification of IoT applications, the low latency and security are the major challenges. To counteract these challenges, the integration of blockchain in edge network is mandated to offer reduced network overhead, transparency, decentralization and fault tolerance. The respective network nodes are capable of collaborating effectively through blockchain consensus mechanism. However, the major bottleneck is the complexity of consensus mechanism. Hence, to perform efficient realization of blockchain in edge network, we propose an exclusive idea of integrating Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) with consensus to put forth PoPLA consensus mechanism. Also, we propose a BLF approach to deliver byzantine tolerance with reduced communication complexity. The experimental evaluation of PoPLA is performed on LoRa WAN. The PoPLA reduces the mining time by 76.25%, 42.13% and 30.05% in comparison with PoW, PBFT and RAFT respectively. The BLF enables PoPLA to outperform PBFT by reducing communication complexity from O(N2) to O(N) while increasing BFT level from 33% to 50% faulty nodes. The cryptanalysis showcases that the PoPLA is resistant to security attacks in blockchain network at edge.",

        "abstract": "Harnessing the benefits of blockchain, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency, to bolster the credibility and security attributes of federated learning (FL) has garnered increasing attention. However, blockchain-enabled FL (BFL) still faces several challenges. The primary and most significant issue arises from its essential but slow validation procedure, which selects high-quality local models by recruiting distributed validators. The second issue stems from its incentive mechanism under the transparent nature of blockchain, increasing the risk of privacy breaches regarding workers' cost information. The final challenge involves data eavesdropping from shared local models. To address these significant obstacles, this paper proposes a Blockchain-enabled Incentivized and Secure Federated Learning (BIT-FL) framework. BIT-FL leverages a novel loop-based sharded consensus algorithm to accelerate the validation procedure, ensuring the same security as non-sharded consensus protocols. It consistently outputs the correct local model selection when the fraction of adversaries among validators is less than $1/2$ with synchronous communication. Furthermore, BIT-FL integrates a randomized incentive procedure, attracting more participants while guaranteeing the privacy of their cost information through meticulous worker selection probability design. Finally, by adding artificial Gaussian noise to local models, it ensures the privacy of trainers' local models. With the careful design of Gaussian noise, the excess empirical risk of BIT-FL is upper-bounded by $\\mathcal {O}(\frac{\\ln n_{min}}{ n_{min}^{3/2}}+\frac{\\ln n}{n})$ , where $n$ represents the size of the union dataset, and $n_{\text{min}}$ represents the size of the smallest dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BIT-FL exhibits efficiency, robustness, and high accuracy for both classification and regression tasks.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly accelerating, driven by increased environmental awareness and technological advancements. However, EV charging faces security and operational challenges hindering widespread adoption. This paper introduces the first method to address both EV charging schedule optimization and security enhancement. It proposes a novel Secure Optimization for EV Charging (SO-EVC) model which addresses the operational and security challenges for EV charging. At the core of SO-EVC is a new FOA-B algorithm, a blockchain-based optimization model that addresses (i) optimizing charging station (CS) locations and (ii) EV routing to CS. FOA-B integrates the Fox Optimizer with Ethereum blockchain technology, leveraging smart contracts for secure, tamper- proof transactions. FOA-B achieves a transaction throughput of 1,200 TPS, outperforming traditional blockchain systems like Ethereum while maintaining decentralization and security. A case study involving 150 EVs and 10 charging stations demonstrated SO-EVC's ability, through FOA-B, to quickly locate optimal charging stations (in 12 iterations) with a standard deviation of 0.22, and reduced dead EVs to just 8%. FOA-B's computational complexity is linear, ensuring scalability with $O(N \times D \times T)$ for optimization and $O(H \times M)$ for blockchain processes. The model maintained steady performance throughout the simulation, showing resilience to downtime. FOA-B also addresses key blockchain challenges, such as the fork phenomena and selfish mining, through a lightweight consensus model and secure transaction validation. Different battery types and environmental temperatures were considered, demonstrating SO-EVC's adaptability in real-world scenarios through FOA-B. These results confirm that SO-EVC provides a comprehensive solution for secure and optimized EV charging systems.",

        "abstract": "Medical healthcare centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle vast data for various disease diagnoses using artificial intelligence. Traditional Machine Learning algorithms have been used for years, putting the sensitivity of patients' medical data privacy at risk. Collaborative data training, where multiple hospitals (nodes) train and share encrypted federated models, solves the issue of data leakage and unites resources of small and large hospitals from distant areas. This study introduces an innovative framework that leverages blockchain-based Federated Learning to identify 15 distinct lung diseases, ensuring the preservation of privacy and security. The proposed model has been trained on the NIH Chest Ray dataset (112 120 X-Ray images), tested, and evaluated, achieving test accuracy of 92.86%, a latency of 43.518625 ms, and a throughput of 10034017 bytes/s. Furthermore, we expose our framework blockchain to stringent empirical tests against leading cyber threats to evaluate its robustness. With resilience metrics consistently nearing 87% against three evaluated cyberattacks, the proposed framework demonstrates significant robustness and potential for healthcare applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on the practical implementation of blockchain-empowered FL with such data and several diseases, including multiple disease coexistence detection.",

        "abstract": "Merkle trees play a crucial role in blockchain networks in organizing network state. They allow proving a particular value of an entry in the state to a node that maintains only the root of the Merkle trees, a hash-based signature computed over the data in a hierarchical manner. Verification of particular state entries is crucial in reaching a consensus on the execution of a block where state information is required in the processing of its transactions. For instance, a payment transaction should be based on the balance of the two involved accounts. The proof length affects the network communication and is typically logarithmic in the state size. In this paper, we take advantage of typical transaction characteristics for better organizing Merkle trees to improve blockchain network performance. We focus on the common transaction processing where Merkle proofs are jointly provided for multiple accounts. We first provide lower bounds for the communication cost that are based on the distribution of accounts involved in the transactions. We then describe algorithms that consider traffic patterns for significantly reducing it. The algorithms are inspired by various coding methods such as Huffman coding, partition and weight balancing. We also generalize our approach towards the encoding of smart contract transactions that involve an arbitrary number of accounts. Likewise, we rely on real blockchain data to show the savings allowed by our approach. The experimental evaluation is based on transactions from the Ethereum network and demonstrates cost reduction for both payment transactions and smart contract transactions.",

        "abstract": "The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system is a critical surveillance technology in Air Traffic Management (ATM), essential for enhancing aviation safety and operational efficiency. However, ADS-B broadcasts plaintext messages over open channels without authentication mechanisms, and is constrained by message length limitations and low bandwidth, making it susceptible to various attacks including deception, tampering, and replay. To address these challenges, we propose a secure and lightweight blockchain-integrated certificateless signature scheme (ECB-CLS) tailored for ADS-B systems with packet resilience. Specifically, we introduce an efficient signature verification algorithm based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that supports batch verification without the need for certificate management, complex bilinear pairing, or hash-to-point calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, our scheme leverages blockchain to ensure the decentralization and traceability of massive public keys and provides provable security against Type I and Type II adversary attacks. To address packet loss in practical environments, we incorporate both standard and enhanced Reed-Solomon (RS) coding to recover lost data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our blockchain-integrated ECB-CLS scheme offers substantial advantages in computational efficiency and signature length compared to existing methods, while also showing that RS coding introduces low performance overhead. This makes our solution highly suitable for resource-constrained ADS-B systems.",

        "abstract": "As an important part of the smart grid (SG), Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) has significantly advanced the development of the grid. However, the open nature of V2G system itself and the deployment of charging piles (CPs) increase the difficulty of terminal control and leave the grid vulnerable to attacks. The existing security schemes of V2G mostly consider the threat of external attacks and conduct defense strategies such as identity authentication and key management, which cannot resist internal attacks initiated by selfish or captured terminals that have passed authentication. In this paper, we propose a lightweight block-chain-based trust management method for V2G terminals. Specifically, we provide a blockchain-based V2G trust management architecture. A V2G terminal adaptive trust calculation model based on information entropy is established, which provides a basis for accurate trust calculation. Considering that, although the on-chain data is tamper-proof, the existing blockchain technology lacks the means to verify the authenticity of the source data before it is uploaded to the chain, a new blockchain consensus mechanism is designed. Wherein five consensus guidelines ensure that only real trust parameters can be written on the chain. In this way, malicious terminals can be identified by consensus screening and trust calculation, thereby taking control measures. Moreover, to avoid redundant hash operations during the trust parameter upload process, Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) is introduced to optimize the block structure. The experimental results show that in comparison to existing methods, LVTM is very resistant to internal attacks, and has lower communication costs and computing overhead.",

        "abstract": "As smart cities rapidly evolve, the Vehicle-toEverything (V2X) network faces significant challenges in data security and communication efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative algorithm based on a reputation mechanism, named the Dynamic Vehicle Reputation Consensus (DVRC), which focuses on improving the data security and communication efficiency of vehicular networks using blockchain technology. The DVRC algorithm comprehensively assesses vehicle behaviors and the consensus contribution within the blockchain network, utilizing a reputation scoring system to evaluate the reliability within the network. Furthermore, this study delves into multimodal communication strategies in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. Notably, when vehicles leave the range of basic infrastructure, those with high reputation scores (as determined by the DVRC's reputation values) relay the communication service. Additionally, the introduction of a reputation incentive mechanism and dynamic consensus threshold adjustments aim to improve consensus efficiency and encourage honest behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the DVRC algorithm significantly improves communication efficiency in blockchain-based vehicular networks, such as increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved network scalability. These advances have substantial theoretical and practical significance for the development of vehicular networks in smart cities",

        "abstract": "Introduced by Google in 2016, Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework to ensure data privacy amid the surge in big data. FL enables secure data sharing without accessing local data. Despite its advantages, it faces challenges due to the limited participation of the data owner. To address this, this paper proposes the Model Value Transfer Incentive (MVTI) to enhance FL incentives for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). MVTI allows active participation of data requesters in FL training, addressing limited data owner engagement, and facilitating personalized model construction. The integrated model bail and contribution assessment mechanism ensures fair benefit redistribution. Using Smart Contracts (SC) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) enhances security and reliability, ensuring transparent and tamper-resistant execution for secure transactions and data integrity. Our experiments highlight MVTIâs superiority in addressing FL incentive challenges for AIoT compared to state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets. We also demonstrate the compatibility of multiple gradient protections with incentive mechanisms, especially with gradient compression. The proposed SC-MVTI scheme is resilient and demonstrates the potential to significantly improve the overall efficacy of the FL system within incentive frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Data sharing is ubiquitous in the metaverse, which adopts blockchain as its foundation. Blockchain is employed because it enables data transparency, achieves tamper resistance, and supports smart contracts. However, securely sharing data based on blockchain necessitates further consideration. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a promising primitive to provide confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Nonetheless, authority accountability and key abuse are critical issues that practical applications must address. Few studies have considered CP-ABE key confidentiality and authority accountability simultaneously. To our knowledge, we are the first to fill this gap by integrating non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs into CP-ABE keys and outsourcing the verification process to a smart contract. To meet the decentralization requirement, we incorporate a decentralized CP-ABE scheme into the proposed data sharing system. Additionally, we provide an implementation based on smart contract to determine whether an access control policy is satisfied by a set of CPABE keys. We also introduce an open incentive mechanism to encourage honest participation in data sharing. Hence, the key abuse issue is resolved through the NIZK proof and the incentive mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the data sharing system. Based on the proposed accountable approach, we further illustrate an application in GameFi, where players can play to earn or contribute to an accountable DAO, fostering a thriving metaverse ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a multi-grained reconfigurable cryptographic accelerator 2.0 (MRCA 2.0), upgrading from the first 8/32/64-bit CGRA named MRCA, to offer high performance with a smaller area and lower power consumption for blockchain-based IoT systems. To achieve these goals, we propose four innovative ideas: a dual processing element array (D-PEA) with reduced memories, a synchronous row connection and processing element (PE) architecture, a concatenable crypto ALU, and heterogeneous PEs. Our MRCA 2.0 has been successfully implemented on the TySOM-3A FPGA platform across 19 different algorithms. Our ASIC experiment on 45nm CMOS technology shows that MRCA 2.0 reduces area and power consumption by 1.6 and 1.4 times, respectively, compared to the previous MRCA. Compared to related works, MRCA 2.0 outperforms in throughput by 1.63-28.3 times and in energy efficiency by 1.6-3.4 times, while also offering better flexibility in supporting more 64-bit algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning, when integrated with blockchain, facilitates secure data sharing in autonomous driving applications. As vehicle-generated data becomes more granular and complex, the absence of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. However, most of the existing research on trajectory prediction focuses on how to improve the model to enhance the prediction accuracy, and lacks the consideration of the privacy and security issues of data sharing in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose an asynchronous federated learning data-sharing method, incorporating an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism based on graph convolutional networks. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints, ensuring security while minimizing redundancy. We utilize deep reinforcement learning to classify vehicles by reputation level, optimizing federated learning aggregation efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only strengthens the security of trajectory prediction but also improves prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning, an emerging distributed learning paradigm, offers significant advantages and holds promise for addressing trust issues, breaking down data silos, and enabling active data sharing in the realm of consumer electronics. However, traditional federated learning faces critical security and privacy challenges in this domain, including single-point attacks, inference attacks, and poisoning attacks. To address these pressing security concerns, this paper proposes a decentralized federated learning framework focusing on security, reliability, and efficiency, tailored to meet the sustainability demands of consumer electronics. The proposed framework is founded upon masking and secret sharing techniques, establishing an emphatic privacy-preserving federated learning framework that ensures the security of gradient data and robustness against participant dropouts. Additionally, we actively motivate high-quality participants to collaborate by incorporating an incentive mechanism. Building upon the enhancement of existing federated learning approaches reliant on masking techniques, the method outlined in this paper significantly reduces communication overhead while preserving accuracy. Empirical research results comprehensively substantiate the superiority of this approach. Furthermore, compared to prevalent blockchain-based federated learning methods, our approach makes noteworthy strides in accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowers consumer electronics, making daily life more convenient, but it also introduces potential privacy risks. Governments worldwide have implemented stringent data regulations to protect individual privacy. Federated Learning (FL) helps AI comply with these regulations and continuously evolve in consumer electronics. However, FL faces significant structural issues and vulnerabilities to parameter pollution attacks. This paper introduces a novel Federated Learning approach for consumer electronics AI applications. Our proposal features a blockchain-empowered decentralized trust mechanism combined with fault defenses to protect against malicious nodes in FL. We also utilize knowledge distillation and meta-learning techniques to thwart poisoning attacks, ensuring the integrity of computations in FL for consumer electronics. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves the integrity of FL processes in consumer electronics, even with over 50% of malicious nodes. This highlights the robust structural and computational fault tolerance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Industry 5.0 emphasizes consumer data sharing to drive data-driven innovation and enhance user experiences in consumer electronics. Blockchain-integrated federated learning (blockchained FL) has recently emerged as a privacy-trusted paradigm to facilitate sharing. However, most blockchained FL sharing paradigms cannot adapt to the complexity or variability of consumer data and network conditions such as: 1) inadequate balancing of the trade-off between data quality and training costs during device selection; 2) incentives are designed to maximize instantaneous profit without considering the long-term dynamics of electronic devices. These limitations lead to low-quality model training and security degradation. This paper proposes a novel blockchained FL incentive-sharing paradigm that dynamically selects consumer devices from a long-term perspective while balancing data quality and training costs. Specifically, we first present a reputation strategy to enhance security by applying a predefined threshold to prevent malicious and low-quality consumers from participating in FL. Then, to optimize device selection under complex and dynamic consumer environments with high-dimensional system states, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based incentive mechanism is proposed, which includes: 1) building an âintelligent engineâ to select the optimal consumer devices for each round of FL based on data quality and costs, and 2) implementing incentives to achieve long-term maximization of the systemâs social welfare. Extensive simulations show that our sharing paradigm has, on average, 46.97% higher social welfare and 77.27% lower social costs than baselines and can guarantee high data quality in a trustless environment.",

        "abstract": "As mobile devices proliferate and mobile applications diversify, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become widely adopted to efficiently allocate computing resources at the network edge and alleviate network congestion. In the MEC initial phase, the absence of vital information presents challenges in devising task-offloading policies, and identifying malicious devices responsible for providing inaccurate feedback is complex. To fill in such gaps, we introduce a consortium blockchain-enabled C ommittee V oting based T ask O ffloading M odel (CVTOM) to collaboratively formulate resource allocation policies and establish deterrence against malicious servers producing erroneous results intentionally. Different voting principle mechanisms of each committee member are first designed in a Blockchain-enabled system which helps to represent the system's resource status. Additionally, we propose a Multi-armed Bandits related T hompson S ampling based A daptive P reference O ptimization (TSAPO) algorithm for task-offloading policy, enhancing the timely identification of potent edge servers to improve computing resource utilization which first considers dynamic edge server space and parallel computing scenarios. The solid proof process greatly contributes to the theoretical analysis of the TSAPO. The simulation experiments demonstrate the delay and budget can be reduced by around 25% and 10% respectively, showcasing the superior performance of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a sought-after distributed machine learning architecture, offering the advantage of model training without direct exposure to raw data. With advancements in network infrastructure, FL has been seamlessly integrated into edge computing. However, the limited resources on edge devices introduce security vulnerabilities to FL in the context. While blockchain technology promises to bolster security, practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains a challenge. Moreover, the exploration of FL with multiple aggregators in edge computing is still new in the literature. Addressing these gaps, we introduce the blockchain-empowered heterogeneous multiaggregator federated learning architecture (BMA-FL). We design a novel lightweight Byzantine consensus mechanism, namely PBCM, to enable secure and fast model aggregation and synchronization in BMA-FL. We study the heterogeneity problem in BMA-FL that the aggregators are associated with varied number of connected trainers with non- IID data distributions and diverse training speed. We propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MASBDRL) to help aggregators decide the best training strategies. Experiments on real-word datasets demonstrate the efficiency of BMA-FL to achieve better models faster than baselines, showing the efficacy of PBCM and MASB-DRL.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a developing technology and its range of applications is satisfying among numerous consumers, as it makes everything very simple. As a concern of its huge evolution, privacy, and security are vital problems where IoT devices are always susceptible to cyberattacks. To overcome this problem, mitigation and intrusion detection are achieved which improves the safety of IoT networks. Recently, the technology of blockchain (BC) has developed as a strength for IoT-based application growth. The BC is mainly operated to resolve single-point failure (third-part dependence), security, and privacy problems of IoT applications. The combination of BC using IoT is an advantage for both society and individuals. However, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on extracting pool discovered the crucial mistake line between BC-permitted networks of IoT. Besides, this use makes vast data quantities. Machine Learning (ML) provides broad sovereignty in the study of big data, and abilities of decision making and so it is employed as a critical device. Therefore, this study develops a Metaheuristic Approach to Detecting and Mitigating Attacks in the Blockchain-Integrated Deep Learning (MHADMA-BCIDL) model. The designed MHADMA-BCIDL approachâs main goal is to classify and detect DDoS attacks and accomplish security in the IoT Application. To obtain this, the MHADMA-BCIDL method utilizes BC technologies to facilitate secured communication in networks of IoT, reinforcing security through decentralized and immutable data storage. For the feature selection process, the arctic tern optimization (ATO) technique is employed to decrease the data dimensionality while conserving the most relevant attributes. Besides, the MHADMA-BCIDL technique employs an attention-based convolutional neural network with bi-directional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM-Attention) method for the detection and classification of attacks. For parameter tuning, the walrus optimizer (W...",

        "abstract": "Internet of Drones (IoD) has become crucial due to the surge of drone-based applications. In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50 Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5 KB. For a sharing group of 60 receivers, drone encryption costs only about 101 ms. The decryption cost remains constant and takes about 3.1 ms.",

        "abstract": "Currently, consortium blockchain has been used in Internet of Things (IoT) systems to ensure secure data sharing across organizations. Consortium blockchain typically uses the Raft algorithm because of its high performance. However, in geo-distributed IoT environments, the single-point overhead problem of leader nodes affects the security and efficiency of consensus due to the high latency and frequency of client requests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel solution: Log Replication Decoupling Raft(LRD-Raft), which enables follower nodes to participate in log replication as well. This scheme reduces the overhead of the leader node by delegating part of the log replication task to the follower node. We also propose an adaptive coding protocol that dynamically adjusts the erasure code parameters according to the number of cluster healthy nodes to save the clusterâs network traffic. We evaluated LRD-Raft in different network latency environments and different cluster sizes, and the experimental results show that LRD-Raft has a more extensive performance system compared to Raft in high network latency and large data block transmission environments, and also has a certain level of resistance to DoS attacks, which improves the performance and security of the consensus mechanism.",

This has prompted researchers to explore Blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (BIoV) solutions to address common issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, at the edge layer, existing reputation and consensus mechanisms in the BIoV model face challenges such as significant energy consumption, limited scalability, and pronounced centralization. To tackle these issues, we introduce TRCO, a Permissioned Blockchain-based Trusted and Robust Consensus Optimization orienting ITS. TRCO is a three-layer BIoV architecture applicable to any BIoV scenario, offering robust scalability with the addition of new sub-regions. To improve the quality of data sharing for edge layer, we propose a decentralized reputation evaluation mechanism and integrate PoS and PBFT consensus algorithms to enhance performance by evaluating the communication behavior of edge servers. Security analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that TRCO achieves high scalability and reliability, effectively filters Byzantine edge servers, and enhances the decentralization and consensus efficiency of the system.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) dwell on Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) for message dissemination to achieve the goal of traffic safety and efficiency. VANETs achieve communication among vehicles and roadside units via wireless communication. Hence, security and privacy are significant concerns to be addressed for an effective application of secure VANETs in any ITS. Researchers have addressed these issues with trust management-based schemes or cryptography-based schemes. While these schemes can secure VANETs, they have various limitations presenting hindrances in their deployment. In this context, we have proposed a Blockchain-assisted Trust Computation with a Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication (BTC2PA) scheme for connected vehicles. The BTC2PA scheme uses a blockchain (Ethereum) assisted PKI infrastructure with digital signatures to achieve authentication for secure communication. Furthermore, it integrates a trust score computation scheme based on a reward and punishment mechanism to provide resistance against internal attacks. The feasibility and validity of the proposed BTC2PA scheme have been studied by implementation work in Rinkeby (Ethereum test network) and extensive simulations using NS-3. The results obtained show that the proposed BTC2PA scheme meets the security and privacy requirements while significantly improving the performance metrics such as communication, storage, computation cost, and end-to-end delay when compared to existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Power network disruptions triggered by weather events, malfunction, sabotage, or other phenomena can leave harrowing effects on communities. Microgrids with distributed energy resources have the potential to enable swift localized restoration following the interruption of utility power. However, because of the limited generation and storage capacity of microgrids, service restoration will require prioritizing critical load and optimality of operations to render relief to those in dire need. Moreover, this essentially requires fair energy allocation, trust-free energy exchanges, and the integrity of transactions. This paper proposes a consortium blockchain-based energy sharing approach for service restoration using energy crowdsourced through donation or trade. The proposed approach provides a framework that utilizes microgridsâ supply situation and reputation as consortium admission criteria for optimizing the energy cost of blockchain operations. The proposed approach uses a measure called proof of welfare (PoWel), which solves the rationing problem to produce an energy allocation block. Accordingly, it proposes an algorithm by utilizing weighted rationing for prioritizing critical load restoration and an evolutionary optimization algorithm for maximizing social welfare and minimizing power losses. The winner block selected through consensus intrinsically preserves the network stability while conforming to resource and stability constraints. An extensive performance and security analysis ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Transport Systems are designed to revolutionize the performance and efficiency of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Consumer electronics encompassing autonomous driving and route planning contribute to a better driving experience. Federated learning enables vehicle collaboration to train global models of intelligent transport without sharing local data for personalized consumer electronics. However, due to the dynamic network topology and unreliable open channels of VANETs, various potential risks undermine the credibility of establishing intermediate model parameters. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight authentication and privacy-preserving aggregation scheme for blockchain-enabled federated learning in VANETs(LPBFL). Specifically, we first construct a distributed secure authentication framework for blockchain federated learning that facilitates seamless authentication of mobile vehicles and security of model transmission. Subsequently, we design a lightweight three-party authentication key agreement based on chaotic map that establishes a session key for secure transmission of the intermediate model. In addition, we propose a continuous authentication adaptive model aggregation algorithms to ensure local model integrity while improving the quality of global models. Finally, security analyses and proofs show that LPBFL enhances the privacy and reliability of intermediate model parameters. Comprehensive experimental evaluations substantiate that the proposed LPBFL facilitates lightweight authentication while maintaining superior model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The advent of 6G networks promises revolutionary advances in dynamism, intelligence, and decentralization. Realizing the full potential of 6G requires adaptable service level agreements (SLAs) that can optimize performance based on dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we suggested a method based on the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain's smart contract with the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to solve the rigidity of static SLA and centralization problems. In order to sustain the quality of service in the radio access network and core network domain of 6G networks, this work focuses on SLA management for efficient resource allocation for the eMBB-plus slice. Our approach entails breaking down static SLAs into finer-grained components, transferring those components onto Hyperledger Sawtooth smart contracts, and using the Reptile meta-learning algorithm to forecast SLA metrics and resource requirements. A dynamic tariff model, also proposed within the smart contract, handles increased user demands. We evaluate the solution by analyzing Reptile performance, resource allocation, and SLA violations under dynamic demands. Results demonstrate the efficiency of this AI-driven, blockchain-based approach for automated, optimized 6G eMBB-plus resource management adhering to dynamic fine-grained SLAs. This work highlights the synergistic potential of AI and blockchain for trusted and intelligent 6G service delivery.",

        "abstract": "StudentsÃ¢ emotional engagement in the classroom can be evaluated through their facial emotions. However, facial emotion recognition remains challenging due to the uncertainty problem, which is routinely caused by factors such as low resolution, intra-class variability, and inter-class similarity. To deal with this problem, we propose a class activation regularization network, which includes two main modules: class activation dropping module (CADM) and hard sample mining module (HSMM). Our key idea is to perform consistency learning between the original images and class-uncertain regions, thereby enabling models to perceive uncertainty of emotional semantics. In CADM, the class-specific attention is obtained using class activation mapping. Then, the attention is partly discarded by imitating dropout mechanism to obtain class-uncertain regions. In HSMM, the hard samples with high uncertainties are identified based on the class-uncertain regions and confidence thresholds. For the hard samples, regularization loss is applied to align the probability distributions between the original images and the class-uncertain regions, thereby improving the network's awareness of emotional semantics and its ability to handle uncertainty. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. In addition, our method can be deployed in the classroom for students' emotional engagement assessment.",

        "abstract": "Most existing MPC protocols consider the homogeneous setting, where all the MPC players are assumed to have identical communication and computation resources. In practice, the player with the least resources often becomes the bottleneck of the entire MPC protocol execution. In this work, we initiate the study of so-called load-balanced MPC in heterogeneous computing. A load-balanced MPC protocol can adjust the workload of each player accordingly to maximize the overall resource utilization. In particular, we propose new notions called composite circuit and composite garbling scheme , and construct two efficient server-aided protocols with malicious security and semi-honest security, respectively. Our maliciously secure protocol is over 400Ã faster than the authenticated garbling protocol (CCS â17) and up to 4.3Ã faster than the state-of-the-art server-aided MPC protocol of Lu et al . (TDSC â23); our semi-honest protocol is up to 173Ã faster than the optimized BMR protocol (CCS â16) and is up to 3.8Ã faster than the protocol of Lu et al .",

        "abstract": "With the popularization of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), the explosion of end users is spurring an unprecedented diversity in preferences. To cope with this challenge, the AIGC paradigm is shifting from cloud-driven pre-trained large models to edge-driven personalized customization models. The former are large-scale models with more than 100 billion parameters trained based on massive data, while the latter introduce heterogeneous user preferences or professional knowledge to fine-tune the former. However, such fine-tuning incurs costly resource consumption and privacy disclosure. In this paper, we offer a holistic perspective on the AIGC fine-tuning framework spanning from end user to edge to cloud. Specifically, we first investigate how to deploy an edge-driven collaborative fine-tuning task through federated learning. Then, we discuss a verifiable model consensus protocol and fairness incentive design for edge servers to participate in a collaborative learning task. In addition, a case study focuses on the medical scenario, where we develop a practical X-ray diagnostic demo through collaborative fine-tuning of a multimodal pre-training model, and the diagnostic dialogue and performance results are compared. Finally, potential research directions are identified to advance the edge-driven customized AIGC services.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent technique of model training in Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) without sharing sensitive local data. Targeting privacy leakage of cross-device FL in CIoT, various privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed. Regrettably, existing schemes still face three significant challenges: 1) Current privacy-preserving strategies struggle to fully defend against Byzantine attacks in FL without compromising data privacy; 2) Most privacy-preserving techniques (e.g. secret sharing) in FL result in substantial computation and communication overhead; 3) The non-colluding dual-server setting limits the applicability of FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Byzantine-robust hierarchical federated learning scheme, named BHFL. This scheme not only effectively defends against Byzantine attacks while safeguarding user privacy but also avoids the need for a dual-server architecture. Simultaneously, the hierarchical aggregation structure can effectively train non-IID cross-device data while maintaining high communication efficiency. We evaluate BHFL on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that BHFL achieves high accuracy and Byzantine robustness compared to the popular FedAvg scheme. Therefore, BHFL is well-suited for CIoT scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Copy detection is crucial for protecting image copyright. This paper proposes a robust image hashing approach via Weighted Saliency Map (WSM) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) (hereafter WSM-LE approach). An important contribution is the WSM construction via the edge map and the saliency map. As the WSM can indicate the interest regions of image, hash calculation based on WSM can provide robustness of our WSM-LE approach. Another contribution is the low-dimensional feature learning by the LE technique. As the LE technique can effectively learn the internal geometric relationships of image, the extracted low-dimensional features can improve discrimination of our WSM-LE approach. In addition, the low-dimensional features are treated as vectors and the vector distances are used to create a compact and encrypted hash. Numerous experiments and comparisons are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our WSM-LE approach. The results indicate that our WSM-LE approach has excellent classification and copy detection performances than some baseline approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract-In this paper, we study the coded caching scheme for the ( K, L, MT, MU, N ) partially connected linear network, where there are N files each of which has an equal size, K + L -1 transmitters, and K users; each user and transmitter caches at most M U and M T files, respectively; each user locally communicates with L nearby transmitters. The goal is to design caching and delivery schemes to reduce the transmission latency measured by the metric named normalized delivery time (NDT). By delicately designing the data placement of the transmitters and users according to the topology, we show that a combinatorial structure called multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), which was originally proposed for the multiple-input single-output broadcast channels, can be also helpful in designing schemes for the partially connected linear network. Then, based on existing MAPDAs and our constructing approach, we propose new schemes that achieve the optimal NDT when M T + M U â¥ N and smaller NDT than that of the existing schemes when ( M T + M U â¤ N , M U / N + M T / N L / K â K / L â â¥ 1) or ( M U + M T < N , K / L â Z+). Moreover, our schemes operate in one-shot linear delivery and significantly reduce the subpacketizations compared to the existing scheme, which implies that our schemes have a wider range of applications and lower complexity of implementation.",

        "abstract": "Images shot underwater are usually characterized by global nonuniform information loss due to selective light absorption and scattering, resulting in various degradation problems, such as color distortion and low visibility. Recently, deep learning has drawn much attention in the field of underwater image enhancement (UIE) for its powerful performance. However, most deep learning-based UIE models rely on either pure convolutional neural network (CNN) or pure transformer, which makes it challenging to enhance images while maintaining local representations and global features simultaneously. In this article, we propose a novel complementary feature perception network (CFPNet), which embeds the transformer into the classical CNN-based UNet3+. The core idea is to fuse the advantages of CNN and transformer to obtain satisfactory high-quality underwater images that can naturally perceive local and global features. CFPNet employs a novel dual encoder structure of the CNN and transformer in parallel, while the decoder is composed of one trunk decoder and two auxiliary decoders. First, we propose the regionalized two-stage vision transformer that can progressively eliminate the variable levels of degradation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Second, we design the full-scale feature fusion module to explore sufficient information by merging the multiscale features. In addition, we propose an auxiliary feature guided learning strategy that utilizes reflectance and shading maps to guide the generation of the final results. The advantage of this strategy is to avoid repetitive and ineffective learning of the model, and to accomplish color correction and deblurring tasks more efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that our CFPNet can obtain high-quality underwater images and show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art UIE methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "abstract": "In the contemporary landscape of vehicular communications, the role of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has become increasingly pivotal, transcending the capabilities of traditional mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). These advancements in VANETs play a critical role in enhancing traffic management systems, promoting collision prevention, bolstering road safety, and efficiently handling emergency scenarios. Modern vehicles, equipped with advanced data collection tools, accumulate extensive information encompassing vehicle health, fuel requirements, and comprehensive location histories. This rich data repository is instrumental in forecasting future destinations and facilitating timely arrangements, embodying the essence of ambient intelligence within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. In emergency contexts, the rapid analysis of vehicle data is crucial for identifying the nearest emergency facilities. This paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages machine learning and edge computing techniques to predict vehicles' subsequent locations using large-scale data, concurrently prioritizing user privacy. We employ federated learning for processing at the network's edge and integrate a blockchain-based distributed database to ensure robust data privacy and security. The application of blockchain and federated learning in training models on expansive datasets is particularly effective in estimating the proximity to medical facilities and emergency services. Furthermore, this study introduces an optimization method to monitor vehicle speed and outlines a comprehensive attack model, along with effective protection measures.",

        "abstract": "In consumer electronics, integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed everyday devices into smart, interconnected systems. However, this progress brings significant challenges in resource management, privacy, and security, particularly with the increasing reliance on data-centric technologies like Deep Learning (DL). The introduction of the Right to Be Forgotten (RBF) policy further complicates data management in DL models. This paper presents a new method for automating consumer electronic devices using Federated Learning (FL). This approach involves training devices with the help of a Digital Twin (DT) and securely storing data on a redactable blockchain after each training cycle. An unlearning mechanism in FL is adapted to meet RBF policy requirements, with the redactable blockchain facilitating the necessary data adjustments. Dual authentication methods are used to prevent malicious attacks: a hampel filter and performance checks during training, and a two-phase system comprising an XoR filter and continuous counter checks for request validation. A proof of concept confirms the systemâs effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the challenges of data trust sharing faced by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network with 5G broadcast services. Particularly we develop a decentralized IoV reputation management model with spatiotemporal feature perception fusion (RMM-STFP) based on blockchain. The proposed reputation evaluation method evaluates the reputation value of nodes from the two aspects of time continuity and spatial transitivity and thus improves the identification accuracy of malicious nodes. To further accelerate the dissemination of reputation data, we have constructed a blockchain-based management storage system, where PBFT consensus scheme combines reputation and Bayesian inference. Finally, numerical results are given to justify the superiority of our proposed scheme. When proportion of malicious nodes reaches 45%, the accuracy of our proposed method is 94.5%, and the suppression rate of malicious messages is 83%. Moreover, compared with the traditional PBFT consensus scheme, the consensus delay and communication overhead are reduced by 87.57% and 78.45%, respectively, and the transaction throughput is increased by 70.65%.",

        "abstract": "In the landscape of smartphone-based human activity recognition (S-HAR), adopting Federated Deep Learning (FDL) introduces challenges, notably in communication inefficiencies and data confidentiality. These issues stem from the requisite submission of learning model parameters by multiple clients to FDLâs global model. To surmount these challenges, the innovative Swarm Learning (SL) paradigm emerges as a solution, presenting a modular approach that fuses distributed computing with blockchain-based coordination. This amalgamation eliminates the dependence on a centralized infrastructure. This study introduces an avant-garde Swarm-Federated Deep Learning framework (SHAR-SFDL) that seamlessly incorporates SL into the FDL framework. SHAR-SFDL orchestrates the collaboration of smartphone users in creating local SL models through blockchain-enabled synergy. The aggregation of these local models into a global FDL model across diverse SL groups is achieved through a groundbreaking method involving model credibility prediction and weight comparison. Notably, the proposed SHAR-SFDL framework showcases a substantial advancement in model performance and a remarkable reduction in edge-to-global communication overhead. Regarding performance evaluation, the proposed model outperformed the other state-of-the-art techniques regarding true and false positive rates across different group densities. Specifically, the TP rates for SHAR-SFDL were 0.891 (High), 0.945 (Medium), and 0.969 (Low), while the corresponding FP rates were 0.035 (High), 0.009 (Medium), and 0.015 (Low). The advancements presented in this study are particularly relevant for applications in consumer electronics, enhancing the efficiency and security of S-HAR systems.",

        "abstract": "Public Key Management systems enable users to create, validate, and revoke public keys, serving as the foundation of public key cryptography. Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems rely on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs) to validate users and manage public keys, but this centralization creates a single point of failure. If a CA is compromised, it can register fake public keys or alter legitimate ones, leading to counterfeit certificates. While blockchain-based approaches decentralize CA authority across multiple entities, these solutions are largely reactive, focusing on certificate issuance and relying on user signatures for validation. They lack a robust mechanism to authenticate and authorize requests before certificate issuance, a crucial step typically managed by Registration Authorities (RA) in CA-based PKI systems. To address this gap, we introduce PKChain, a novel compromise-tolerant and verifiable public key management system built on blockchain. PKChain addresses two key challenges: it uses a Threshold Block Validation (TBV) scheme for key request validation, where validators partially validate requests and collaborate for full validation. Once a request gains majority approval, it advances to the Aggregated Commitment Signature (ACS) scheme, where validators collectively issue certificates. By requiring majority approval in the TBV stage before moving to certificate issuance, PKChain ensures proactive security throughout the process. To achieve consensus on validation and issuance, we propose a threshold cryptography-based consensus mechanism called the practical Byzantine Compromise-tolerant and Verifiable (pBCTV) consensus model, integrating TBV and ACS schemes with the practical Byzantine Fault-tolerance (pBFT) protocol. Security analysis, performance evaluation, and prototype implementation validate PKChainâs security, efficiency, and resilience.",

Our model was applied in a real-world case study to streamline multiple-choice question (MCQ) creation and management in education.

        "abstract": "Recently, watchtowers emerge as a critical service within payment channel networks (PCNs). Existing payment channels necessitate that channel owners periodically monitor the blockchain to ensure their fund security, or enlist the watchtower services for this task. Presently, watchtower proposals mandate the implementer to provide collateral as a safeguard against its collusion with potential adversaries. However, this collateral substantially inflates the implementation costs, consequently leading to higher service fees for users. Furthermore, most watchtowers are typically operated by a third-party entity, creating a single point of failure. To ameliorate the status quo, we propose a novel approach where PCN nodes collaboratively implement a watchtower system named âSilenTower.â Our proposal is rooted in the fundamental principles of blockchain systems, emphasizing maintenance by a community with an honest majority. SilenTower's security no longer relies on collateral but rather on the inherent difficulty of a large proportion of collusion. SilenTower also allows inaccessible participants and thus obtains robustness. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that participants' optimal strategy is to remain accessible and faithfully adhere to the SilenTower protocol. Furthermore, we assess the practical performance of SilenTower through comprehensive benchmarking, and the results reveal that it introduces lightweight overheads.",

        "abstract": "Voting protocols are fundamental in modern society. With the ongoing evolution of communication technology and the Internet of Things, the importance of electronic voting protocols is anticipated to experience a significant rise in the advancement of smart cities. Leveraging the blockchainâs tamper-resistant and publicly verifiable properties, along with the concept of enabling all participants to tally election results, blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocols effectively address the shortcomings of centralized traditional electronic voting. However, existing voting protocols still face the dual challenge of security and efficiency. The primary issues include the difficulty in ensuring voter anonymity and election fairness, as well as the insufficient system robustness and low tallying efficiency resulting from security design. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach to constructing efficient and flexible voting protocols that concurrently ensure fairness and anonymity. Specifically, we encapsulate the decryption private keys corresponding to the public keys of encrypted ballots in time capsules to safeguard voting fairness. Additionally, based on our proposed approach, we construct an efficient and flexible score voting protocol for smart cities. The protocol employs traceable ring signature to protect the voter anonymity and public traceability, utilizes a dual-key additive homomorphic ElGamal encryption to encapsulate ballots. We also improve signature-based set membership proofs to verify the validity of ballots. Furthermore, through security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed protocol meets all security objectives with reasonable costs.",

        "abstract": "Anonymous Payment Channel Hub (PCH), one of the most promising layer-two solutions, settles the scalability issue in blockchain while guaranteeing the unlinkability of transacting parties. However, such developments bring conflicting requirements, i.e., hiding the sender-to-receiver relationships from any third party but opening the relationship to the auditor. Existing works do not support these requirements simultaneously since off-chain transactions are not recorded in the blockchain. Further, the privacy protection strategies hinder auditors from capturing the payment relationships. Thus, it is still a challenge to audit the finance activities of PCH transacting parties. This paper proposes a novel anonymous PCH solution called AuditPCH to achieve privacy and auditability. Concretely, we design a Linkable Randomizable Puzzle scheme for constructing conditional transactions, allowing a sender to pay for a receiver via the hub. As such, AuditPCH, with the new LRP scheme, ensures that (1) payment relationships can be protected from the hub and (2) an auditor with necessary trapdoors can associate the sender and receiver of a payment. We prove the security of AuditPCH under the Global Universal Composability framework. The extensive experimental evaluations on AuditPCH are established to demonstrate its functionality and flexibility.",

        "abstract": "The process of transferring land records (LRs) and ownership between users is facilitated by a LR transfer system. This system encompasses a series of procedures, including conducting title search, establishing agreements, executing legal documentation, verifying and transferring ownership, and updating LRs. Despite its importance, the system encounters notable challenges, such as insufficient tamper-proof record-keeping, lack of system compatibility, time-consuming processes, and the presence of intermediaries and brokers leading to potentially fraudulent claims. To address these challenges, a novel solution called LandChain is proposed in this article. The LandChain utilizes MultiChain, consisting of MainChain and SideChain, to securely transfer LRs among users, such as buyers, sellers, land donors, and owners. The LandChain incorporates innovative algorithms like record forwarder selection (RFS), trust establishment (TE), and record transfer and confirmation (RTC). Furthermore, LandChain verifies the legitimacy of users before transferring LRs through the verify user legitimacy algorithm. Security analysis shows LandChain is secure from double-spending, liveness, Sybil, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The implementation of LandChain is developed and tested on the docker engine platform. According to performance analysis, the LandChain reduces record confirmation latency by 18% (MultiChain) and 50% (Blockchain). LandChain also increases throughput by 34% (MultiChain) and 45% (Blockchain) when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Data sharing in Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) is an essential road service that assists vehicle driving and promotes intelligent transportation applications. In VSNs, vehicles regularly collect and upload valuable data to share with other vehicles. Data encryption can be employed during data uploading and sharing to prevent malicious tampering and privacy disclosure. However, existing data-sharing schemes lack security, have high overhead in obtaining decrypted data, and show low trust in the central authority controlling the entire network. To facilitate data sharing in VSNs, this paper proposes a new scheme using consortium blockchain to realize secure data sharing. Nodes in the blockchain invoke smart contracts and implement the location-based Speculative Byzantine Fault Tolerance (LSBFT) to accomplish data-sharing transactions among vehicles. The scheme not only ensures the security of vehicle information but also protects the privacy of the shared data. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist attacks and has shown transaction fairness, data confidentiality, non-repudiation, and traceability. Simulation results show that the scheme has higher sharing efficiency and less time to reach a consensus in the data storage process.",

        "abstract": "Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) is a classical protocol that enhances transaction privacy within blockchain technology. It is primarily utilized in anonymous cryptocurrencies such as Monero. In recent years, to counter the security threats posed by quantum computing to classical RingCT (C-RCT), several post-quantum RingCT (P-RCT) protocols were proposed. However, prior studies do not address the account transition from C-RCT to P-RCT, which is essential to ensure the quantum resistance and usability of user accounts following the upgrade from C-RCT to P-RCT. In this paper, we introduce a RingCT account transition protocol (RAT), which allows users to migrate their accounts from the blockchain with C-RCT to that with P-RCT. The protocol consists of two cryptographic components: a zero-knowledge proof scheme used to prove that two group generators correspond to the same witness, and a cross-cryptosystems commitment transition protocol. RAT is fully decentralized and does not require any trusted third parties. Additionally, the transition process does not disclose the account balance and maintains both atomicity and consistency. The security of our protocol relies on the cryptographic components within RingCT, without the need for additional security assumptions, such as a trusted setup. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol in practice.",

        "abstract": "Grid resilience has become a paramount concern in todayâs dynamic energy landscape, wherein the mass integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) plays a crucial role in achieving flexible and resilient power grids. A DER management system (DERMS) is a remote monitoring and control system managing DERs in a distribution system, which is becoming increasingly important for a DER-rich power grid. However, an outstanding issue is a single point of failure of the centralized DERMS by cyberattacks, which threatens grid stability and results in regional power outages in the worst case. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the resilience challenges faced in the centralized DERMS through the development of a blockchain (BC)-assisted resilient control mechanism. The main idea is to create a virtual DERMS monitoring and control using BC smart contract and network that takes over seamlessly in the event of a failure of the DERMS. This BC system enables securely sharing DER and grid data among BC clients and provides control commands to DERs when the DERMS is a denial-of-service condition. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BC-assisted DERMS, voltage and frequency control recovery cases are tested in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop DER system testbed.",

        "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of vehicular networks, it is crucial to ensure robust security and efficient data handling. In this work, We introduce a novel federated learning(FL) algorithm integrated within a Distributed Edge Intelligence (DEI) framework, enhanced by a blockchain consensus mechanism, specifically designed for Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) to enhance data privacy, efficiency, and system resilience. Motivated by the pressing need for improved data privacy and security in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), our approach can not only prioritize these aspects but also enhance the efficiency and accuracy of distributed machine learning. The proposed consensus mechanism, by integrating Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), is crafted to be lightweight, making it suitable for the dynamic and resource-constrained vehicular environments. Our evaluation findings demonstrate the algorithmâs superior performance and scalability, suggesting its applicability in diverse IoV scenarios and its potential to facilitate secure, robust, and efficient collaborative learning.",

        "abstract": "Sharding presents an enticing path toward improving blockchain scalability. However, the consensus mechanism within individual shards faces mounting security challenges due to the restricted number of consensus nodes and the reliance on conventional, unchanging nodes for consensus. Common strategies to enhance shard consensus security often involve increasing the number of consensus nodes per shard. While effective in bolstering security, this approach also leads to a notable rise in consensus delay within each shard, potentially offsetting the scalability advantages of sharding. Hence, it becomes imperative to strategically select nodes to form dedicated consensus groups for each shard. These groups should not only enhance shard consensus security but also do so without exacerbating consensus delay. In this article, we propose a novel consensus group selection based on transmission delay between nodes (CGSTD) to address this challenge, with the goal of minimizing the overall consensus delay across the system. CGSTD intelligently selects nodes from various shards to form distinct consensus groups for each shard, thereby enhancing shard security while maintaining optimal system-wide consensus efficiency. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis to evaluate the security properties of CGSTD and derive approximation ratios under various operational scenarios. Simulation results validate the superior performance of CGSTD compared to baseline algorithms, showcasing reductions in total consensus delay, mitigated increases in shard-specific delay, optimized block storage utilization per node, and streamlined participation of nodes in consensus groups.",

        "abstract": "Advertising campaigns are crucial in business development, but most marketing techniques target online purchases (e.g., Google Adsense) and rely on a centralized architecture to store and process the campaign's data and check its effectiveness. Recently, proximity marketing has become more popular thanks to the widespread use of smartphones. It exploits the short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth) between smartphones and beacon devices to collect and send marketing information to customers. However, this might create privacy issues for customers due to the potential leakage of sensitive information (such as locations associated with time). In this paper, we propose ProMark, a privacy-aware blockchain-based platform to verify the effectiveness of proximity marketing campaigns by ensuring transparency, decentralization, and privacy in the measurement process. We implemented ProMark and carried out experiments that show that ProMark can be used in super-regional malls even during peak hours.",

        "abstract": "Distributed learning empowers social media platforms to handle massive data for image sentiment classification and deliver intelligent services. However, with the increase of privacy threats and malicious activities, three major challenges are emerging: securing privacy, alleviating straggler problems, and mitigating Byzantine attacks. Although recent studies explore coded computing for privacy and straggler problems, as well as Byzantine-robust aggregation for poisoning attacks, they are not well-designed against both threats simultaneously. To tackle these obstacles and achieve an efficient Byzantine-robust and straggler-resilient distributed learning framework, in this article, we present Byzantine-robust and cost-effective distributed machine learning (BCML), a codesign of coded computing and Byzantine-robust aggregation. To balance the Byzantine resilience and efficiency, we design a cosine-similarity-based Byzantine-robust aggregation method tailored for coded computing to filter out malicious gradients efficiently in real time. Furthermore, trust scores derived from similarity are published to the blockchain for the reliability and traceability of social users. Experimental results show that our BCML can tolerate Byzantine attacks without compromising convergence accuracy with lower time consumption, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it is 6x faster than the uncoded approach and 2x faster than the Lagrange coded computing (LCC) approach. Besides, the cosine-similarity-based aggregation method can effectively detect and filter out malicious social users in real time.",

        "abstract": "While online medical diagnosis provides significant convenience to users, it also incurs the risk of privacy breaches, which inspired the emergence of various privacy-preserving online medical schemes. Nonetheless, existing schemes either compromise partial privacy to third parties or rely on cryptographic methods with high computational complexity. In particular, they do not anticipate user's disputes to the extent that there is no audit process to guarantee the correctness of the diagnosis results and the fairness of the schemes. Consequently, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online medical diagnosis scheme based on additive secret sharing (ASS). First, the anonymity of the user is provided in the medical diagnosis process, which ensures that the cloud cannot link the diagnosis results to the user. Then, we devise a minimum value protocol and a range comparison protocol to enhance the security of the online diagnosis. In addition, considering user's disputes that arise in realistic scenarios (e.g., malicious users may cheat the diagnosis system for personal benefits), we construct a blockchain-based audit process to detect user's behaviors and settle controversies. Finally, we demonstrate the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme with theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Collaborative authentication, boasting enhanced accuracy, robust resilience, and optimized efficiency, holds immense promise for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, existing collaborative authentication methods overlook both the credibility evaluation and incentives of participating nodes, thereby compromising authentication accuracy and resulting in failures. Furthermore, reliance on trusted decision-fusion institution introduces vulnerabilities and single points of failure. To address these issues, we design a credibility-weighted soft authentication approach specifically for UAV networks, thereby enhancing accuracy by effectively integrating the trustworthiness of collaborating nodes. To further encourage active participation from nodes, we introduce an incentive-based reputation system. Finally, based on the above approaches, we propose a distributed authentication method by leveraging blockchain technology and optimization theory that not only emphasizes security but also optimizes resource selection in UAV networks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates our schemeâs distributed authentication with minimized resource consumption under specified security strength, mitigating single points of failure and fulfilling efficient mutual authentication requirements. Experimental results show a remarkable 78.45% increase in authentication accuracy and a 44.51% reduction in resource consumption compared to advanced solution.",

        "abstract": "In mobile edge computing, user behavior analysis can provide a more clear understanding of edge user behavior, which is crucial for providing more accurate recommendation services to mobile users. However, privacy leakage is inevitable in the process of edge user behavior data collection, storage and analysis. How to protect edge user privacy is very urgent for the development of mobile edge computing. Existing schemes dealing with these problems still suffer from 1) high computational overhead, 2) low model accuracy and poor convergence under privacy-preserving, and 3) poor model robustness when edge nodes fail. Therefore, we propose a novel privacy-preserving model in edge user behavioral analysis termed Safe-FL to protect the behavioral privacy of all edge participants by introducing secure data aggregation and encryption in the federated learning (FL) framework. To reduce the privacy leakage of data uploading in edge user behavior analysis, we first construct a federated learning-based edge user behavior analysis framework. Secondly, we utilize a hybrid encryption scheme to encrypt the local model hierarchically to protect the gradient privacy in edge user behavior analysis and reduce the encryption computation overhead. And finally, to improve the robustness of the model, we propose a decentralized secure gradient aggregation algorithm based on blockchain. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, whose results illustrate that our model has 1) strong privacy preservation and small computational overhead; 2) high accuracy and convergence speed; and 3) good robustness, compared to other models.",

        "abstract": "With the prevalence of smart contracts, smart Ponzi schemes have become a common fraud on blockchain and have caused significant financial loss to cryptocurrency investors in the past few years. Despite the critical importance of detecting smart Ponzi schemes, a reliable and transparent identification approach adaptive to various smart Ponzi schemes is still missing. To fill the research gap, we first extract semantic-meaningful actions to represent the execution behaviors specified in smart contract bytecodes, which are derived from a literature review and in-depth interviews with domain experts. We then propose PonziLens+ , a novel visual analytic approach that provides an intuitive and reliable analysis of Ponzi-scheme-related features within these execution behaviors. PonziLens+ has three visualization modules that intuitively reveal all potential behaviors of a smart contract, highlighting fraudulent features across three levels of detail. It can help smart contract investors and auditors achieve confident identification of any smart Ponzi schemes. We conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 12 domain experts and common investors to evaluate PonziLens+ . The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PonziLens+ in achieving an effective identification of smart Ponzi schemes.",

        "abstract": "With the acceleration of globalization and urbanization processes, cold chain logistics (CCL) for agricultural products plays a pivotal role in modern agricultural supply chains. This study aims to explore methods to enhance the efficiency and quality of agricultural product CCL supervision through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Addressing challenges such as real-time data acquisition difficulties, information asymmetry, and data security concerns in the agricultural CCL sector, this research develops an IoTbased agricultural CCL supervision system. This system innovatively integrates three components: a real-time data collection module, a temperature and humidity regulation module, and a logistics information privacy protection module. The latter employs an anonymous authentication based on blockchain to bolster the security and confidentiality of logistics information. The system model is simulated and evaluated by Matlab. Results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits optimal computational efficiency, maintaining a computational overhead of approximately 0.10 seconds, which is lower than other algorithms exceeding 0.13 seconds. In terms of operational efficiency, with 250 consensus nodes, the consensus throughput remains consistently above 90 bps, while CPU utilization does not exceed 20%. Regarding data transmission security, the average delivery rate of the model exceeds 80.48%, and the average leakage rate remains below 5.72% for a data volume of 10Mb, underscoring robust network data security transmission performance. Therefore, the system model developed in this study significantly enhances the real-time accuracy and security of agricultural product CCL supervision, presenting a pioneering technical solution essential for advancing the efficiency and quality of the supply chain.",

        "abstract": "Hexanal detection is essential for real-time monitoring of oil oxidation stability and evaluating health impact. Nevertheless, accurately monitoring hexanal levels in the presence of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) remains a significant challenge. In this article, we present an In 2 O 3 /SnO 2 composite-based electrochemical gas sensor that offers excellent selectivity for hexanal over other tested VOCs, such as styrene, acetone, and n-hexane, and featured a remarkably low detection limit of approximately 50 parts per billion (ppb). Additionally, a gas sensing device that integrated the aforementioned electrochemical hexanal sensor with blockchain technology was developed to facilitate remote monitoring of hexanal variations. In particular, shuffling technology and digital signatures were utilized to bolster the security of data transmission and access. It turns out that the developed sensing device demonstrated impressive performance in both sensing accuracy and data security, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for remote hexanal monitoring.",

        "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to evolve, its inherent diversity and rapid iteration pose challenges for the development and deployment of malicious traffic detection systems. This study aims to develop a scalable detection architecture that can accurately identify malicious traffic in IoT environments, while protecting user privacy. We propose a deep-learning-based model that is capable of training and updating within an IoT setting. The payload of the data packets is encoded to enhance the feature extraction capability of the model. The model is then trained using federated learning/edge computing to ensure data privacy. The final model parameters are stored in an IPFS file storage system with the corresponding hash value stored in the blockchain, ensuring the correctness of the model parameters during expansion. Experiments were conducted in a Docker environment using the CIC IoT Dataset 2022 and CIC IoT Dataset 2023. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a pre-training accuracy of 98.6% for known abnormal traffic and 79% for unknown malicious traffic. After a few rounds of training, the accuracies improved to 99.5% and 89.4%. The model also exhibited robust performance during expansion.",

        "abstract": "In crowdsourcing systems, requesters publish tasks, and interested workers provide answers to get rewards. Worker anonymity motivates participation since it protects their privacy. Anonymity with unlinkability is an enhanced version of anonymity because it makes it impossible to âlinkâ workers across the tasks they participate in. Another core feature of crowdsourcing systems is worker quality which expresses a worker's trustworthiness and quantifies their historical performance. In this work, we present AVeCQ, the first crowdsourcing system that reconciles these properties, achieving enhanced anonymity and verifiable worker quality updates. AVeCQ relies on a suite of cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, to (i) guarantee workersâ privacy, (ii) prove the correctness of worker quality scores and task answers, and (iii) commensurate payments. AVeCQ is developed modularly, where requesters and workers communicate over a platform that supports pseudonymity, information logging, and payments. To compare AVeCQ with the state-ofthe-art, we prototype it over Ethereum. AVeCQ outperforms the state-of-the-art in three popular crowdsourcing tasks (image annotation, average review, and Gallup polls). E.g., for an Average Review task with 5 choices and 128 workers AVeCQ is 40% faster (including computing and verifying necessary proofs, and blockchain transaction processing overheads) with the task's requester consuming 87% fewer gas.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy trading based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as blockchains, has attracted much attention due to its promising features, including ease of deployment, decentralization, transparency, and security. However, existing DLT-based models do not support microtransactions due to the low value of such transactions relative to the incentives offered to transaction verifiers. To address this issue, we propose an IOTA DLT-based efficient and secure energy trading model for V2G networks, where electric vehicles (EVs) and grids negotiate energy prices in an off-chain manner. The proposed model utilizes a privacy-preserving protocol to prevent real-time tracking of EV locations. We develop a Stackelberg game model to represent the interactions between the EVs and grids, from which we derive a pricing scheme and propose a deposit mechanism to prevent fake energy trading between the EVs and grids. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms existing V2G energy trading mechanisms regarding transaction efficiency, provides enhanced EV privacy, and improves resilience against fake energy trading.Offering robust computational performance and addressing computational complexity (time, space, and message), our model presents a comprehensive V2G energy trading solution, balancing efficiency, security, and privacy.",

        "abstract": "The advent of 6G networks will present a pivotal juncture in the evolution of telecommunications, marked by the proliferation of devices, dynamic service requests, and the integration of edge and cloud computing. In response to these transformative shifts, this paper proposes a service and resource discovery architecture as part of service provisioning for the future 6G edge-cloud-continuum. Through the architectureâs orchestration and platform components, users will have access to services efficiently and on time. Blockchain underpins trust in this inherently trustless environment, while semantic networking dynamically extracts context from service requests, fostering efficient communication and service delivery. A key innovation lies in dynamic overlay zoning, which not only optimizes resource allocation but also endows our architecture with scalability, adaptability, and resilience. Notably, our architecture excels at predictive capabilities, harnessing learning algorithms to anticipate user and service instance behavior, thereby enhancing network responsiveness and preserving service continuity. This comprehensive architecture paves the way for unparalleled resource optimization, latency reduction, and seamless service delivery, positioning it as an instrumental pillar in the unfolding 6G landscape. Simulation results show that our architecture provides near-optimal timely responses that significantly improve the networkâs potential, offering scalable and efficient service and resource discovery.",

        "abstract": "Both Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus schemes for permissioned blockchains incur the risk of centralization of voting power in the hands of a small number of wealthy voters. In this work, we present Qualified Proof of Stake (QPoS) scheme which alleviates centralization by rewarding truthful behavior of both voters and leaders, and penalizing their untruthful behavior. Leaders are elected according to the current stake which gives preference to more trustworthy nodes. Nodes with low stake at the end of a round which consists of multiple PBFT voting cycles are excluded from voting in subsequent rounds, while nodes with sufficient stake may leave the network temporarily without losing their stake. We consider multiple node classes with different voting behavior and model them using embedded Markov Chain which corresponds to Semi Markov Process (SMP) in order to determine system performance. Our results show the interaction of class populations, voting behavior, and mobility with round size, and show notable stake-based prioritization among the nodes for selection of PBFT leaders. Moreover, we show that higher proportion of well behaved nodes and shorter voting rounds are needed to achieve consensus with high probability.",

        "abstract": "The dissemination of public opinion in the social media network is driven by public sentiment, which can be used to promote the effective resolution of social incidents. However, public sentiments for incidents are often affected by environmental factors such as geography, politics, and ideology, which increases the complexity of the sentiment acquisition task. Therefore, a hierarchical mechanism is designed to reduce complexity and utilize processing at multiple phases to improve practicality. Through serial processing between different phases, the task of public sentiment acquisition can be decomposed into two subtasks, which are the classification of report text to locate incidents and sentiment analysis of individualsâ reviews. Performance has been improved through improvements to the model structure, such as embedding tables and gating mechanisms. That being said, the traditional centralized structure model is not only easy to form model silos in the process of performing tasks but also faces security risks. In this article, a novel distributed deep learning model called isomerism learning based on blockchain is proposed to address these challenges, the trusted collaboration between models can be realized through parallel training. In addition, for the problem of text heterogeneity, we also designed a method to measure the objectivity of events to dynamically assign the weights of models to improve aggregation efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve performance and outperform the state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

        "abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a leading method to scale the transaction throughput in cryptocurrencies. Two participants can use a bidirectional payment channel for making multiple mutual payments without committing them to the blockchain. Opening a payment channel is a slow operation that involves an on-chain transaction locking a certain amount of funds. These aspects limit the number of channels that can be opened or maintained. Users may route payments through a multi-hop path and thus avoid opening and maintaining a channel for each new destination. Unlike regular networks, in PCNs capacity depends on the usage patterns and, moreover, channels may become unidirectional. Since payments often fail due to channel depletion, a protection scheme to overcome failures is of interest. We define the stopping time of a payment channel as the time at which the channel becomes depleted. We analyze the mean stopping time of a channel as well as that of a network with a set of channels and examine the stopping time of channels in particular topologies. We then propose a scheme for optimizing the capacity distribution among the channels in order to increase the minimal stopping time in the network. We conduct experiments and demonstrate the accuracy of our model and the efficiency of the proposed optimization scheme.",

        "abstract": "Industrial intelligent systems (IIS) play a huge role in modern industry, and their intelligent models of IIS enable diagnosis of faults, key performance indicator (KPI) prediction, and other important industrial process analysis in a data-driven way. However, the performance of intelligent models is limited by the quantity and quality of local data in specific factories. At the same time, the privacy information and security concerns contained by industrial data lead to the problem of information silos in industry. This hinders data sharing and cross-factory collaborations. To address these issues, this article makes the following contributions. First, for the first time, we empower industrial federated big data analytics (IFBDA) of IIS with swarm learning, and propose a hyperledger fabric-based IFBDA blockchain (IFBDAchain) for multifactory information sharing and collaborative modeling. Second, in the IFBDAchain, we further consider potential dishonest behaviors among federated members, and design verification and privacy protection mechanisms to ensure trustworthiness of analytics. Third, we validate the IFBDAchain with two real industrial cases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the IFBDAchain in fault classification and KPI prediction tasks in industry. Compared to the average values of local learning, our method increases the classification accuracy by 27.6%, 69.4%, and 33.1% under Independent and identically distributed (IID), non-IID, and unbalanced conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error of the KPI prediction decreases by 33.3%, 49%, and 45.7% for the IID, non-IID, and unbalanced conditions, respectively, indicating its significant potential as a generic backbone for industrial federated Big Data analytics.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data. However, FL entails exposing the model to various participants. This poses a risk of unauthorized model distribution or resale by the malicious client, compromising the intellectual property rights of the FL group. To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embed the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints. Experimental results show FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, and maintains good fidelity and robustness against various watermark removal attacks.",

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing provides an effective way to collect labeled data and train models for machine learning. However, crowd workers performing data collection may expose them to the risk of privacy breaches, which lowers their willingness to participate in the tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism for a federated learning paradigm, namely TiFedCrowd, which mitigates the risk of privacy breaches for crowd workers and obtains high-quality crowdsourcing data and learning models at the minimum cost. TiFedCrowd allows clients to keep privacy-related data locally, just needing to upload trained models (parameters) to the server. The server then aggregates local models into a global model. TiFedCrowd models the federated crowdsourcing process as a two-stage Stackelberg game and motivates more workers to complete tasks with high quality and efficiency. It also provides a time control mechanism to manage the quality of the submitted outcomes, the range of data freshness, and the waiting time. TiFedCrowd requires the client to complete the federated crowdsourcing task within a specified time interval while globally maximizing the utility of both clients and the server by solving the Nash equilibrium. We also extended TiFedCrowd to the multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario. Extensive simulation shows that TiFedCrowd not only ensures the fairness of the incentive but also has significant effects on accelerating convergence speed, selecting data/model quality, and saving the budget. Moreover, we also confirm the effectiveness of TiFedCrowd in real-world crowdsourcing tasks.",

        "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) compromise the privacy of training data through interrogating a victim machine learning model and inferring whether or not a query sample is in the training data. Existing defenses against MIAs include preprocessing the training data of the model, modifying loss functions, and perturbing the inference output. However, all these mechanisms have to change either the training or inference process, which might be out of reach of the defenders, especially when the models are deployed in a third-party cloud service. In this paper, we propose preprocessing the query samples before feeding them into the models for inference. Specifically, we design a Membership Cleanser module to remove the member information in the query sample by moving it closer to non-member area in the feature space. The membership cleanser does not modify the training or inference process of the machine learning model, so it can be applied to any machine learning system. Through extensive evaluation on four datasets against different models, our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art defense mechanisms in resilience and practicality against various MIAs while retaining good inference accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial examples. Conventional attacks generate controlled noise-like perturbations that fail to reflect real-world scenarios and hard to interpretable. In contrast, recent unconstrained attacks mimic natural image transformations occurring in the real world for perceptible but inconspicuous attacks, yet compromise realism due to neglect of image post-processing and uncontrolled attack direction. In this paper, we propose RetouchUAA, an unconstrained attack that exploits a real-life perturbation: image retouching styles, highlighting its potential threat to DNNs. Compared to existing attacks, RetouchUAA offers several notable advantages. Firstly, RetouchUAA excels in generating interpretable and realistic perturbations through two key designs: the image retouching attack framework and the retouching style guidance module. The former custom-designed human-interpretability retouching framework for adversarial attack by linearizing images while modelling the local processing and retouching decision-making in human retouching behaviour, provides an explicit and reasonable pipeline for understanding the robustness of DNNs against retouching. The latter guides the adversarial image towards standard retouching styles, thereby ensuring its realism. Secondly, attributed to the design of the retouching decision regularization and the persistent attack strategy, RetouchUAA also exhibits outstanding attack capability and defense robustness, posing a heavy threat to DNNs. Experiments on ImageNet, Place365 and CUB200 reveal that RetouchUAA achieves nearly 100% white-box attack success against three DNNs, while achieving a better trade-off between image naturalness, transferability and defense robustness than baseline attacks.",

        "abstract": "The application of Internet of Vehicles(IoV) technology has greatly improved usersâ driving experience, but it also faces some challenges: (1) the central server is not powerful enough to support the rapid growth of IoV identity authentication requests; (2) there is a privacy leakage issue during vehicle authentication. To address these issues, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme based on TRUG-PBFT (Trustworthy Roadside Unit Group) master-slave chains and zero-knowledge proof. First, to enhance authentication efficiency, we propose the TRUG-PBFT consensus algorithm. It improves the traditional PBFT by optimizing the PBFT consensus process, reducing the number of consensus nodes using fractional grouping, and selecting master node using verifiable random functions (VRF). Second, we use lattice-based zero-knowledge proof scheme to achieve anonymous authentication of vehicles, and important data in the vehicle authentication process is stored by the main chain maintained by the base station group and the slave chain maintained by the roadside unit group. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that compared to PBFT consensus, TRUG-PBFT in terms of consensus efficiency is improved by approximately 33%, and the authentication schemeâs computational cost is only 7.08ms, superior to existing authentication schemes.",

        "abstract": "Data aggregation management is paramount in data-driven distributed systems. Conventional solutions premised on centralized networks grapple with security challenges concerning authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. Recently, distributed ledger technology has gained popularity for its decentralized nature to facilitate overcoming these challenges. Nevertheless, insufficient identity management introduces risks like impersonation and unauthorized access. In this paper, we propose Degator, a data aggregation management framework that leverages self-sovereign identity and functions in decentralized networks to address security concerns and mitigate identity-related risks. We formulate fully decentralized aggregation protocols for data persistence and acquisition in Degator. Degator is compatible with existing data persistence methods, and supports cost-effective data acquisition minimizing dependency on distributed ledgers. We also conduct a formal analysis to elucidate the mechanism of Degator to tackle current security challenges in conventional data aggregation management. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of Degator through its application in the management of decentralized neuroscience data aggregation and demonstrate its scalability via performance evaluation.",

        "abstract": "The imminent deployment of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems promises new opportunities and challenges for model training using data from edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, current research has yet to fully address the efficiency and scalability challenges arising from the extensive connectivity of edge devices across various scenarios. The presence of malicious devices further intensifies system uncertainty during large-scale data interactions and model training, making it difficult for a single model to effectively manage the complexities introduced by heterogeneous devices and dynamic network conditions. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedSC, an innovative edge computing framework that leverages side-chain technology for efficient edge node management and employs federated learning to enable robust cross-device and cross-scenario model interactions. To accelerate the multi-model aggregation process, we introduce an asynchronous cross-domain iterative algorithm (ACDI) based on smart contracts. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of malicious and inactive nodes, we propose a robust consensus algorithm and a committee mechanism for leader node election based on contribution value. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedSC achieves a 3.2% and 44.23% accuracy improvement on i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. dataset, respectively, along with a remarkable latency reduction of 256.51%, compared to FedAvg. Our work is conducive to the training of multiple models in different IoT scenarios, utilizing substantial amounts of IoT device data and facilitating collaboration between models. Furthermore, it enables the provision of fundamental services to diverse applications in 6G.",

        "abstract": "Smart contracts have gained extensive adoption across diverse industries, including finance, supply chain, and the Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the surge in security incidents of smart contracts over recent years has led to substantial economic losses. Therefore, ensuring the security of smart contracts has become a critical and complex challenge in both academic and industrial domains. Based on 539 real-world security incidents in the Ethereum platform and audit reports from 10 authoritative auditing institutions, we summarize 27 types of exploited security vulnerabilities and draw insights into their principles, typical cases, relevant research and recommended prevention strategies. Besides, we also gather 7 other potentially threatening vulnerability types as supplements. On this basis, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes of vulnerabilities and further formulate eight safety practical rules. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive review of 178 recent papers on smart contract security analysis, classifying detection methods into formal verification, fuzz testing, machine learning, program analysis, and others. For each category, we seize the specific detection tools and analyze them comprehensively. Then, we conduct an extensive analysis and synthesis from various angles, presenting a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape in smart contract security detection. We also discuss current on-chain and off-chain repair methods. Finally, this review outlines major challenges and highlights potential areas for future research in this field",

        "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-assisted confidential smart contracts (TCSC) have attracted extensive attention from both academia and industry. Despite an enormous number of TCSC projects, the extent of confidentiality offered by them remains being questioned: the factual and fictional aspects are not well distinguished, which limits their adoption. In this paper, we provide a formal treatment of TCSC, endowing them with an expressive syntax and multiple security definitions. Then, we present a provably secure TCSC instantiation under our definitions. We correspondingly identify the implementation flaws in each algorithm that may make a TCSC system violate its security properties. The analysis reveals the gap between the model and the real-world system: even assuming a TCSC is provably secure, it may fail to be secure in practice. We further compare our TCSC instantiation with 16 representative TCSC systems. Our results surprisingly show that all these surveyed projects are subject to practical attacks.",

        "abstract": "The invasive insect brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB) is an emerging pest of global importance, as it is destroying fruits and seeds, having caused estimated damages of â¬â588 million to crops in 2019 in Northern Italy alone. An open challenge is to improve monitoring of BMSB in order to be able to deploy countermeasures more efficiently and to increase consumer confidence in the end product. The Horizon 2020 Haly.ID project seeks to reduce or eliminate dependence on conventional monitoring tools and practices, such as traps, baits, visual inspections, sweep netting, and tree beating. In their place, the project proposes the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for monitoring the insect population and investigates novel methods for enhancing the quality of fruit in the market. In this work, we focus on the novel autonomous IoT insect monitoring system consisting of multiple innovative solutions for BMSB monitoring and trusted data management developed in Haly.ID . In particular, this article describes the challenges faced when integrating and deploying this monitoring system consisting of those different parts and aims at presenting valuable âlessons learnedâ for the realization of future deployments. We show that massive over-provisioning of power supply and network speed allows to adapt the system at run-time reflecting changing project requirements, and to conduct experiments remotely. At the same time, over-provisioning introduces new weak points impacting the system reliability, such as cables that can be unplugged or damaged.",

        "abstract": "Tor's original design does not have an incentive mechanism but relies on volunteers to maintain their relay nodes for free, eventually leading to the current situation of centralization and lack of relay nodes. Current incentive schemes designed for Tor generally rely on centralized roles, thus presenting a risk of destroying Tor's anonymity. This paper proposes R2E, a decentralized scheme that treats Tor relay services as cryptocurrency mining and rewards the relays with generated tokens while addressing the challenge of how to design decentralized protocols that quantify workload while ensuring fairness and anonymity. We construct the Proof-of-Relay protocol in R2E that enforces random circuit selection, limits the number of nonce attempts, and exploits one-time keys and zero-knowledge proofs to protect participants' identities. We implemented a prototype of R2E based on Ethereum and conducted the trial operation and several confirmation experiments involving\n2\n20\nclients,\n2\n10\nto\n2\n16\nnodes, and 256 circuits for each client to demonstrate its applicability. Analysis and experimental results show that R2E can effectively ensure the anonymity of participants' identities and fairness of incentive allocation while showing good performance in overhead and scalability, making it easy to be quickly applied in practical deployments.",

        "abstract": "The centralized data sharing challenges in healthcare have spurred the adoption of distributed methods, including blockchain technology, to enhance security and privacy. This paper proposes a blockchain-based healthcare system leveraging post-quantum cryptography to secure sensitive patient data, stored on a permissioned blockchain. Discrete event simulation (DES) is used in the simulation to represent and assess three critical processes: blockchain transactions, patient data requests, and data encryption. We examine the dynamics of blockchain transaction processing, encryption effectiveness, and data access inside the suggested architecture through simulation. The results highlight how post-quantum encryption and blockchain technology can strengthen healthcare data management by resolving important concerns about patient data sharingâs integrity and confidentiality.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technologies have emerged to serve as a trust basis for the monitoring and execution of business processes, particularly business process choreographies. However, dealing with changes in smart contract-enabled business processes remains an open issue. For any required modification to an existing smart contract (SC), a new version of the SC with a new address is deployed on the blockchain and stored in a contract registry. Moreover, in a choreography, a change in a partner process might affect the processes of other partners, and thus, must be propagated to partners affected by the change. In this paper, we propose an approach overcoming the limitations of SCs and allowing for the change management of blockchain-enabled declarative business process choreographies modeled as DCR graphs. Our approach allows a partner in a running blockchain-based DCR choreography instance to change its private process. A change impacting other partners is propagated to their processes in a decentralized manner using a SC. The change propagation mechanism ensures the compatibility checks between public processes of the partners and the consistency between the private and public processes of one partner. We demonstrate the approach's feasibility through an implemented prototype and its effectiveness via a set of evaluation tests.",

        "abstract": "Emerging information technologies have accelerated the construction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Unfortunately, the explosive growth of various services has caused serious challenges to access control in terms of scalability and trustworthiness. In this paper, we proposed the smart collaborative contract based endogenous access control mechanism. First, access control procedures running on centralized servers are migrated to distributed equipment located inside the data plane, which can reduce the transmission overhead and improve service capacity. Second, the smart collaborative contract is designed for credibility enhancement since part of attackers may attempt to compromise access control. It covers terminal behavior assessment and service request recording. Experiments conducted in a prototype show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than the traditional solution and is resistant to common attacks.",

        "abstract": "In next-generation networks, distributed clients collaborate to generate an aggregated global model tailored for various vertical applications. However, this convenience comes at the cost of potential privacy risks, as personal information may be exposed within the global model aggregation process. In response, the right to be forgotten was introduced, granting individuals the right to withdraw their consent for the processing of their personal information. To address this challenge, machine unlearning has been developed, enabling models to erase any memory of private data. Previous approaches, such as retraining or incremental learning, often require additional storage or are difficult to implement in neural networks. Our method, by contrast, introduces a small perturbation to the modelâs weights, guiding it to iteratively move towards a model trained only on the remaining data subset until the contribution of the unlearned data is completely removed. In our approach, machine unlearning is conceptualized as a process that iteratively adjusts the initial model to remove any trace of the forgotten data. Our key contribution is the introduction of a reference model, trained on a subset of the remaining data, which guides the target unlearning model toward successfully forgetting the data. Additionally, we discuss two evaluation methodsâmembership inference and backdoor evaluationâthat effectively assess the success of our machine unlearning approach. These methods verify whether the private data has truly been forgotten by the target unlearning model. Through experiments on five datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which is 15Ã faster than the traditional retraining method.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed traditional healthcare systems by enabling real-time monitoring, remote diagnostics, and data-driven treatment. However, security and privacy remain significant concerns for IoMT adoption due to the sensitive nature of medical data. Therefore, we propose an integrated framework leveraging blockchain and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enable secure, intelligent, and transparent management of IoMT data. First, the traceability and tamper-proof of blockchain are used to realize the secure transaction of IoMT data, transforming the secure transaction of IoMT data into a two-stage Stackelberg game. The dual-chain architecture is used to ensure the security and privacy protection of the transaction. The main-chain manages regular IoMT data transactions, while the side-chain deals with data trading activities aimed at resale. Simultaneously, the perceptual hash technology is used to realize data rights confirmation, which maximally protects the rights and interests of each participant in the transaction. Subsequently, medical time-series data is modeled using bidirectional simple recurrent units to detect anomalies and cyberthreats accurately while overcoming vanishing gradients. Lastly, an adversarial sample generation method based on local interpretable model-agnostic explanations is provided to evaluate, secure, and improve the anomaly detection model, as well as to make it more explainable and resilient to possible adversarial attacks. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the high performance of the integrated secure data management framework leveraging blockchain and XAI, compared with the benchmarks.",

However, this openness introduces new security issues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Zero-Trust architecture tailored for ORAN (ZTORAN). ZTORAN includes two main modules: (1) A blockchain-based decentralized trust management system for secure verification, authentication, and dynamic access control of xApps; and (2) A threat detection module that uses Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (FMARL) to monitor network activities continuously and detects anomalies within the ORAN ecosystem. Through comprehensive simulations and evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZTORAN in providing a resilient and secure framework for next-generation wireless networks.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL , which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners ( i.e. , the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.",

        "abstract": "In the context of 6G networks, efficient information transmission at high speeds with large data volumes to the cloud poses technical challenges, particularly related to data type heterogeneity and information security. This is especially critical when dealing with extensive data from diverse users, leading to issues in data utilization efficiency and security. To tackle these challenges, an innovative approach has been developed, employing the following data processing methods: (1) Users utilize the Mobile Edge Computing server to train the initial model, sign and upload it to the Blockchain. Due to constraints in data block size, off-chain storage is implemented using InterPlanetary File System. Additionally, differential privacy technology safeguards user privacy during this process; (2) Addressing the vast multi-source heterogeneous data in the 6G network, the Federated Transfer Learning mode is employed. This involves combining cross-user characteristics in different business formats after the data processing center acquires user data. Blockchain replaces the centralized aggregator in the federated learning system, enhancing the security of data transmission. By utilizing actual datasets from sources such as sandstorm, typhoon, and flood data, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly enhances data utilization efficiency, improves the security of data transmission, predicts disasters, and minimizes disaster losses.",

        "abstract": "As a representative of the public blockchain, Ethereum has been applied in various industries. However, the vast number of transactions on the platform has also brought a number of illegal activities, such as phishing scams, which have caused significant damage to the Ethereum ecosystem. Due to anonymity of the blockchain, it is difficult for detectors to extract features that can be directly applied to phishing scams detection. Existing studies mainly model Ethereum transaction records as a network and mine key information from them to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods usually employ traditional feature engineering or network embedding, ignoring the fine-grained features in the transaction network. In addition, since the original network is too large to make learning difficult, existing work usually uses random walk to sample a part of nodes for training, thus ignoring the multiplicity of the network. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a three-stream feature fusion (TSFF) approach to enhance the feature representation of nodes. Specifically, we construct node states to guide random walk sampling, and manually extracted 8-dimensional features from the resulting dataset as basic features. Temporal features are jointly learned through long short-term memory network and Contrastive Learning. We combine residual blocks and Graph Convolutional Network to extract fine-grained structural features from transactional networks. Finally, we fuse these three types of features and input them into a downstream classifier. Experiments show that our TSFF (85.3% Precision) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the effectiveness of each feature is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of the industrial Internet of things (IIoTs) has facilitated the development of diverse platforms and management technologies. However, the lack of standardized protocols and interoperability between platforms developed by various organizations hinders seamless integration. These limitations represent the primary challenge in access control between different IIoT platforms, resulting in limited service utilization across heterogeneous platforms. This study addresses the challenges of effectively sharing user attributes and representations for access control between heterogeneous IIoT platforms using blockchain and a metadata registry (MDR). Utilizing blockchain ensures tamper-proof and transparent attribute sharing, whereas the MDR facilitates the accurate mapping of user attributes for cross-platform resource access control. We demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed framework by successfully implementing access control between two representative standard platforms, namely oneM2M and FIWARE. Our results indicate that enhancing service utilization through access control between heterogeneous IIoT platforms can improve security and efficiency across various industries.",

        "abstract": "PID control, which stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative control, is a widely used control technique in various fields, including lighting control systems, manufacturing industry, appliance power management, solar water heating systems and smart thermostats. The lighting control systems involve the use of minimal energy for controlling the lighting system inside the residential and industry premises for consumers to minimize the redundant consumption of energy during daylight hours or in unoccupied areas/rooms. The machine intelligence based algorithms and Fuzzy based PID control based algorithms play integral role in guaranteeing the accuracy and stability of the lighting control system. In lighting control system, the PID control algorithm is employed to regulate the lighting system in multiple aspects such as desired angle, temperature, outdoor light impact and intensity. This study focuses on saving the consumption of energy and enhancing the accuracy of PID control in lighting control system for consumers through the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Blockchain technology. By optimizing the lighting control system with the aid of the hybrid PSO (IHPSO), the intelligent PID control algorithm shows improvements in controlling the lighting system in an automated manner. The system has been compared with the exiting methods for proving its performance over the existing techniques. Performance test experiments demonstrate that the IHPSO fuzzy PID control algorithm exhibits a smaller error speed compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using 100 units of samples, resulting in a higher accuracy rate ranging from 87% to 99%, with an average accuracy rate of 94% across the 100 residential units. The improved PSO algorithm is further assessed by repeatedly testing the same samples, showing significant superiority over other algorithms with a Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 2.357%, Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1....",

        "abstract": "Wireless biosensor devices have significantly enhanced level of convenience associated with patient treatment. Presently, most uncertified aggregate signature methods struggle to withstand key attacks that employ only specific keys. This paper presents an uncertified parallel key-isolated aggregate signature framework that utilizes blockchain technology in wireless medical sensor networks and biosensor devices for consumer electronics to tackle the challenges. The proximity of the signature verification and aggregation processes to end users is increased by integrating a bio-sensor device for consumer electronics into the cutting-edge framework. This action simultaneously enhances the safeguarding of patient confidentiality and mitigates computational burden on primary cloud server. By integrating the advantages of key-isolated and uncertified technologies, the proposed solution circumvents exposure concerns, difficult certificate administration, and key storage. This study demonstrates that the proposed method is resistant to Type I, Type II, and wholly selected key attacks when implemented in a random oracle model. This scheme shows a reduction in calculation overhead of 82.97%, 74.03%, 84.58%, and 86.79% correspondingly when compared to other schemes. Analysis of performance indicates that in comparison to pertinent uncertified signature systems, this solution can reduce communication overhead by a minimum of 25% and computational cost by a minimum of 74.03%.",

        "abstract": "Introducing slicing into integrated satellite-terrestrial networks enables the flexible deployment of network resources and being adaptable for more new applications. However, the heterogeneity of integrated satellite-terrestrial network poses challenges to network resource access control. To ensure users can securely and efficiently access service across multiple management domains, we propose a network slice access authentication and service authorization scheme based on a sharding permissioned blockchain. Slice tenants and wireless network operators with management control act as consortium blockchain nodes, which are divided into shards, and the blockchain is maintained in parallel by multiple shards. Firstly, an efficient public ledger is constructed to establish decentralized trust and manage user identity and service authorization information. Secondly, utilizing the trapdoor collision resistance of the chameleon hash, users can fully self-select their secret key and generate authentication credentials to register on the blockchain without key escrow problem. When users move into a new network domain, the mutual authentication between users and the visited network can be quickly completed. The session key is negotiated based on the Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral protocol with perfect forward secrecy. Then, the editable transaction blocks, storing network slice authorization information and slice templates, are linked using chameleon hashes. This allows the access permissions of slice resources to be dynamically adjusted and easily queried by the service-providing wireless network operators. Performance evaluation and security simulations demonstrate the correctness of the scheme, showing that it can achieve secure access to integrated satellite-terrestrial network slice services with low computational and communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "The complexity and heterogeneity of the Sixth Generation (6G) networks raise trust issues among network users. Implementing blockchain-based decentralized trust management in 6G networks ensures user trustworthiness while mitigating the risk of single-point failures. However, the throughput limitation of the blockchain restricts the efficiency of recording trust data, leading to the inability to promptly expose trustless users in the system. To address this issue, this article proposes a Multi-State Consensus (MSC), a blockchain-based trust management scheme that incorporates three novel consensus protocols. These three novel consensus protocols are utilized in different network states to efficiently record the trust data of trustless users, thereby exposing them more quickly. Additionally, in MSC, new users gain initial trust values through the multi-signatures of blockchain miners, thereby addressing the trust value cold-start problem. Experimental results demonstrate that MSC not only exposes trustless users more rapidly but also ensures the robustness of network operations.",

        "abstract": "To utilize a unified waveform to realize radar and covert communication functions simultaneously, we propose a novel high speed covert dual function radar communication waveform using phase-reduced shift keying and code-domain index modulation (HCDFRC-PRSK-CDIM). First, the spherical codes are selected for code-domain index modulation to improve the communication rate. In addition, the binary phase shift keying scheme with a reduced phase are introduced to embed the information in linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals with covertness. Simulation results show that the designed waveform has good covertness and bit error rate (BER) performance without affecting radar detection performance.",

        "abstract": "The connected and autonomous systems (CAS) and auto-driving era is coming into our life. To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making and blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message exchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message broadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission delay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network. Therefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed structure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach consistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus cannot be directly deployed. In addition, with the development of intelligence in machines, traditional consensus might be inefficient for future CAS. This article reviews several existing consensus mechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms that apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in CAS. To deploy wireless-adapted consensus, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based message structure to build a non-equivocation data dissemination protocol for CAS, which has resilience against message loss and unpredictable forwarding latency, and has the potential to solve the first step of future intelligent consensus. Finally, we enhance this protocol by developing a two-dimension DAG-based strategy to achieve partial order for blockchain and total order for the distributed service model SMR, to show its potential of integrating into different consensus protocols.",

        "abstract": "Natural hazards causing catastrophic damage and infrastructure destruction have increased in recent decades, with floods being a serious problem that leads to crop damage, population loss, infrastructure degradation, and public service collapse. Digital Twin (DT) technology is a promising solution for alerting communities of oncoming floods and providing sufficient time for evacuation and property protection. This research introduces a digital twin-inspired intelligent framework that analyzes hydrological and meteorological parameters causing floods, validated using data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms improve situational analysis and decision-making for flood forecasting, while advanced blockchain security features keep recorded and analyzed data secure. A case study demonstrates the proposed approachâs efficacy in smart catastrophe management with the best training and testing accuracy of 97.23% and 95.58%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Amidst the technological revolution, the convergence of Industrial Artificial Intelligence of Things (Industrial AIoT) signifies a profound transformation in industrial operations. Nonetheless, persistent concerns revolve around data privacy, security, and connectivity challenges. Drones emerge as pivotal aids for Industrial AIoTs, particularly in areas with limited connectivity. While Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) address data privacy and adaptability, challenges like data heterogeneity, scarcity, model positioning, unauthorized data tampering, and cyber threats endure. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Federated Meta-Learning (FML)-based secure data consolidation scheme, utilizing drones for data consolidation, especially in remote, poorly connected regions, followed by secure blockchain storage. It incorporates an Information Gain Ratio (IGR)-based feature selection method to manage data diversity, a two-phase authentication system merging XOR filtering and Chronological Nonce Authentication for entity validation, and secure model consolidation using Hampel filters and performance checks to validate model updates. A real-world proof of concept demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art literature.",

        "abstract": "The demand for mobile terminals to participate in data services is increasingly vital. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has established several principled requirements for data services. Existing studies focusing on data service put emphasis on data privacy and accessibility. However, they face challenges in achieving data forgetability and portability on mobile devices under GDPR and lack consideration of usage control. In this paper, we propose ADSS, an app-level data service scheme for mobile devices that can be available-but-invisible and guarantee fine-grained usage control. ADSS addresses the challenges by executing the logic of data usage in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and managing the TEE states (i.e., data usage states) in the blockchain smart contracts. It not only satisfies the requirements of GDPR, ensuring strong security and confidentiality guarantees, but also enables the functionality of âpay-per-useâ. We implement a prototype of the ADSS framework based on ARM Trustzone and conduct experimental evaluations. The results demonstrate that our scheme brings high efficiency compared with other data service schemes and exhibits feasibility on mobile-grade devices.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance based on blockchain has experienced rapid development. To safeguard the privacy of participants, decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) systems such as ZCash and Zether have emerged. These systems employ cryptographic techniques to conceal the trader addresses and payment amounts. However, this anonymity presents challenges in terms of regulation. To address this issue, we propose the Walsh-DAP (WDAP) scheme, an efficient and generic regulation scheme for decentralized anonymous payments that strikes a balance between regulation and privacy preservation. Our scheme introduces two regulation policies: first, users who have exceeded their spending limits within a certain period will be identified during the regulation process; second, the supervisor possesses the capability to trace any anonymous transaction. To implement regulation effectively, we have designed an innovative commitment scheme, Walsh commitment, which leverages the orthogonal properties of Walsh codes to achieve the features of aggregatability and extractability. The supervisor in WDAP only needs to deal with the aggregation result of the Walsh commitments instead of the huge amount of raw transactions information, which greatly increases the efficiency. In a DAP system with 256 users, 10 transactions per second and 30 days as a regulation period, we reduced the communication cost for regulation from 14GB to 94.20KB, and the computing cost from\n1.6Ã\n10\n5\ns to 2.17s. Both improvement is of over five orders of magnitude. We formally discussed the security of the whole system, and verified its feasibility and practicability in the ZCash system.",

        "abstract": "For Industry 5.0, people collaborate with artificial intelligence machines and robots, where the aim is beyond productivity. With customer-centric services, the smart grid evolves with the promotion of 6G and Industry 5.0. Data aggregation is necessary for analyzing accumulated consumption, adjusting demand and response, and predicting the trend. A host of data aggregation schemes for the smart grid considering security have been proposed. However, the hazard of information leaking still exists. Security features like fault-tolerance and unlinkability in aggregation schemes are hot problems that require discussions. In this paper, we propose our data aggregation scheme CFDAS for the smart grid with blockchain assistance in 6G networks under the concept of Industry 5.0. By employing a traditional three-layer structure, the aggregation process can be executed based on different consumption categories at fog nodes and control center. Formal verification proves that our scheme exhibits resistance to forgery attacks. Also, it satisfies usual security features like unlinkability and fault-tolerance. Compared to several recent schemes, ours performs well in time and communication overhead and is practical for 6G networks.",

Despite these technological advancements, current industries still face several issues related to human-centric design, data interoperability, sustainability and standardized design. To deal with these issues and to promote Industry 5.0 revolution, the necessity of Zero-Touch Network Management (ZTNM) techniques in industries is inevitable. Therefore, this work presents a novel ZTNM-enabled Industry 5.0 architecture and validates its importance using two industrial use-case scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss several ZTNM-supported technologies, potential challenges and possible solutions for upcoming Industry 5.0 automation.",

        "abstract": "Distributed Vehicle Sharing System (DVSS) leverages emerging technologies such as blockchain to create a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for sharing vehicles. In such a system, both efficient matching of users with available vehicles and optimal pricing mechanisms play crucial roles in maximizing system revenue. However, most existing schemes utilize user-to-vehicle (two-sided) matching and pricing, which are unrealistic for DVSS due to the lack of participation of service providers. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel Three-sided stable Matching with an optimal Pricing (TRIMP) scheme. First, to achieve maximum utilities for all three parties simultaneously, we formulate the optimal policy and pricing problem as a three-stage Stackelberg game and derive its equilibrium points accordingly. Second, relying on these solutions from the Stackelberg game, we construct a three-sided cyclic matching for DVSS. Third, as the existence of such a matching is NP-complete, we design a specific vehicle sharing algorithm to realize stable matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRIMP scheme, which optimizes the matching process and ensures efficient resource allocation, leading to a more stable and well-functioning decentralized vehicle sharing ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "Accountable anonymous credentials protect user privacy while holding the accountability of ill-intentioned individuals, which is a critical feature for applications such as online payments and other financial services. Existing accountable anonymous credentials rely on a public committee of trustworthy members who are assumed not to collude and are well protected to perform privacy revocation. However, this assumption is unsound in blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems because the selected committees may involve nodes with significant stakes, and public nodes serving as committee members are vulnerable against targeted attacks from high-computing power adversaries. In this paper, we propose an improved accountable anonymous credential called AccCred, allowing users and issuers to randomly select a hidden committee within a set of authenticated candidates for privacy revocation. No one except the members with corresponding private keys knows their identity, preventing proactive attacks. As a core component, we introduce the primitive of dynamic triple-hiding committees (DTHC), which achieves authentication, dynamic join/delete, random selection, and strong anonymity of committee members. As a building block of DTHC, we design a shuffle protocol to provide efficient shuffle proof of randomized public keys. We formally prove our scheme and compare its performance with previous work for demonstration of practicality.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Computing Force Networks (CFNs) have emerged to deeply integrate and flexibly schedule multi-layer, multi-domain, distributed, and heterogeneous computing force resources. CFNs build a resources trading platform between consumers and providers, facilitating efficient resource sharing. Therefore, resources trading is an important issue but it faces some challenges. Firstly, because all kinds of large-scale and small-scale resource providers are distributed in a wide area and the number of consumers is larger compared with edge/cloud computing scenarios, the credibility of consumers and providers is hard to guarantee. Secondly, due to market monopolies by large resource providers, fixed pricing strategies, and information asymmetry, both consumers and providers exhibit a low willingness to engage in resources trading. To solve these challenges, the paper proposes an incentive mechanism for trust-driven resources trading to guarantee trusted and efficient resources trading. We first design a trust guarantee scheme based on reputation evaluation, blockchain, and trust threshold setting. Then, the proposed incentive scheme can dynamically adjust prices and enable the platform to provide appropriate rewards based on providersâ classified types and contributions. We formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the trading platformâs utility and obtaining an optimal contract based on individual rationality and incentive compatible constraints. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme, highlighting its potential to reshape the future of computing resource management, increase overall economic efficiency, and foster innovation and competitiveness in the digital economy.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to pioneer the development of a real-time interactive and immersive Metaverse Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system leveraging Virtual Reality (VR). The system incorporates a three-dimensional (3D) face reconstruction method, grounded in weakly supervised learning, to enhance player-player interactions within the Metaverse. The proposed method, two-dimensional (2D) face images, are effectively employed in a 2D Self-Supervised Learning (2DASL) approach, significantly optimizing 3D model learning outcomes and improving the quality of 3D face alignment in HCI systems. The work outlines the functional modules of the system, encompassing user interactions such as hugs and handshakes and communication through voice and text via blockchain. Solutions for managing multiple simultaneous online users are presented. Performance evaluation of the HCI system in a 3D reconstruction scene indicates that the 2DASL face reconstruction method achieves noteworthy results, enhancing the system's interaction capabilities by aiding 3D face modeling through 2D face images. The experimental system achieves a maximum processing speed of 18 frames of image data on a personal computer, meeting real-time processing requirements. User feedback regarding social acceptance, action interaction usability, emotions, and satisfaction with the VR interactive system reveals consistently high scores. The designed VR HCI system exhibits outstanding performance across diverse applications.",

        "abstract": "Edge computing significantly enhanced the growth of edge-assistant video streaming applications. However, challenges such as unpredictable wireless conditions, resource constraints, and task redundancy have intertwined impacts on the overall performance of edge video streaming systems (EVS). Therefore, it is essential to have an integrated framework that addresses resource management, computational offloading, and video task preprocessing. Existing optimization strategies often neglect the simultaneous management of computational offloading, resource allocation, and video task preprocessing, leading to a suboptimal system utility. Moreover, they struggle to handle high-dimensional decision variables. On the other hand, learning-based adaptive schemes fall short in integrating distributed decisions and ensuring the scalability of wireless devices. Additionally, current approaches lack adaptive incentives. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel framework called AIRA, which is based on improved multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and smart contracts. AIRA manages resources, video compression, and adaptive incentives in a distributed manner. It consists of a MARL-driven cooperative learning algorithm (CLA) and a smart contract-guided adaptive incentive mechanism. Leveraging an actorcritic structure, the CLA enables wireless devices to master strategies for resource allocation, video task compression, and offloading, utilizing historical data. Notably, the CLA incorporates an attention mechanism to select pivotal tuples from the observationaction pairings among different agents, ensuring improved scalability and computational prowess. Evaluations based on real-world trajectories demonstrate that AIRA enables adaptive incentives. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, CLA effectively enhances the long-term system utility and scalability of EVS",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) system collects data from various smart devices and sensors to make tailored decisions. However, in complex IoT setups, privacy can be compromised through data collection, processing, and sharing. Thus, safeguarding data during transmission is crucial. Combining blockchain technology with covert communication has made progress in addressing these issues, but challenges like low data embedding rates and identifiable blockchain transactions with covert data remain. To tackle this, this paper analyzes Ethereum transaction field formats, identifying the input data field as the target for high-capacity embedding. A data covert transmission scheme using hybrid embedding in contract fields is proposed, employing LSB steganography to embed covert data in images and incorporating the image URL into the input data field of Ethereum smart contracts, increasing embedding rates. Additionally, a new method for data embedding based on contract relationships is introduced, enabling covert data transmission through the invocation relationships of smart contracts, rather than directly embedding data in transactions. This makes transactions theoretically indistinguishable from regular ones, enhancing security. Finally, evaluations of undetectability, embedding rate, and scalability show that the proposed schemes excel in all three areas.",

        "abstract": "Ponzi contracts are fraudulent investment scams that promise high returns with little risk to investors. However, existing methods for detecting Ponzi contracts have several limitations. For example, they struggle to deal with the class imbalance problem, and their analysis of function call transactions is inadequate, resulting in redundant features. To tackle the challenges of detecting Ponzi contracts, we present PonziFinder, a novel approach that leverages convolutional-based edge-enhanced graph neural network and attention mechanism for the classification of contract transaction graphs. In contrast to previous methods, we not only consider transaction value and timestamp but also analyze transaction input to standardize and sort transactions. We extract node and edge features that capture the unique characteristics of Ponzi contracts. The edge feature, reflecting interaccount correlation, enhances the propagation and updating of node features for effective Ponzi contract detection. To prevent oversmoothing of node embedding caused by the shallow transaction graph and extract important account node information, we introduce an attention-based global layerwise aggregation mechanism (ALGA) for generating the final contract graph representation for classification. Moreover, we optimize the node feature set and use an effective strategy based on undersampling and ensemble learning to address the issue of class imbalance. Experimental results show that PonziFinder can detect all types of Ponzi contracts (100%) with 97% accuracy when there is sufficient transaction data, outperforming other models. The analysis of input values and the ALGA mechanism are experimentally shown to improve accuracy by 4% and 2%, respectively. In summary, PonziFinder is a novel and effective method for detecting Ponzi contracts. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "WebAssembly, or WASM for short, is a binary code format for a stack-based virtual machine, first published in 2018 and now becomes a main-steam technology for providing distributed serverless functions. Recently, the demand for privacy and trustless serverless functions has started to grow in cloud, edge, and grid computing, which poses a question for those serverless function providers: how they ensure trustworthy computation in safety-critical scenarios like financial systems, cybersecurity, private data handling, etc. To address this, we leverage the technology ZKSNARK  (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge), a powerful proof system that allows efficient verification of the evaluation problem of statements, to give WASM runtime the ability to provide trustless computation service. More precisely, we present ZKWASM, a ZKSNARK  backed virtual machine that emulates the execution of WASM bytecode and generates zero-knowledge-proofs for the emulation result. The proof generated by the ZKWASM  virtual machine can then be used to convince an entity, with no leakage of confidential information, that the result of the emulation enforces the semantic specification of WASM.",

        "abstract": "Phishing scams are one of Ethereum's most representative security risks that can defraud many transactions in a short period and severely threaten network security. Existing deep learning-based phishing scam detection methods mainly rely on constructing static transaction graphs which are assumed to be accessible before model training. However, static methods that have a high false positive rate to detect newly generated phishing scams by adding this newly generated data to existing algorithms for execution, due to new accounts and transactions constantly appearing in the real-world Ethereum network. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, proposes a novel evolve-based phishing scams detection method (named GrabPhisher) that extracts temporal features of accounts and captures information about the dynamic topology of the graph as it evolves. Specifically, GrabPhisher can build the evolutionary pattern of accounts trading on Ethereum as a diffusion network graph in continuous time. It can continue to capture new transaction features based on existing transactions, which facilitates the identification of phishing accounts. Additionally, we implement GrabPhisher on the real-world Ethereum phishing scams datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GrabPhisher can effectively extract dynamic temporal features and outperform state-of-the-art methods (95% Recall, and 88% F1-score).",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) concept within Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) facilitates instantaneous information sharing among vehicles, leading to a seamless exchange of multimedia content, enhanced traffic management, heightened road safety, and ultimately contributing to a transportation ecosystem that is both more enjoyable and secure. However, the paradigm of P2P faces various challenges ranging from network scalability and reliability to the frequent topology changes of vehicular environments and weak resource management. As a result, a set of problems could be generated, such as data inconsistency and unreliability, weak lookup success rate, and low end-to-end delay, especially when requesting data. To address all these issues, we propose an innovative solution that leverages an aerial backbone consisting of a connected group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This system efficiently covers the integrality of the terrestrial vehicular environment while ensuring efficient data sharing and distribution towards it, thus playing the role of an aerial P2P overlay. The establishment of the aerial backbone takes into account two factors: (i) the connectivity degree among UAVs and (ii) their remaining energy levels. To ensure that these two factors are constantly verified and maintain permanent data availability for the vehicular environment, a Deep Q Network (DQN) method is adopted to optimize the movements of UAVs according to the terrestrial environment dynamics. After conducting a series of simulations, our methodology exhibits a marked superiority over existing baseline techniques regarding lookup time and success rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new secure and privacy-preserving prediction-enhanced solution for reliable physical-to-virtual communications in human digital twin (HDT) systems. With such a prediction-enhanced connectivity (PeHDT) framework, the evolution of any virtual twin (VT) could be triggered in real-time or in advance using the expected state of its physical counterpart. This ensures the continuous maintenance of a true replica of each physical twin (PT), thus relieving the need for timely PT-VT synchronization while the VT-experienced delay is reduced to zero or close to zero. We adopted a secured federated multi-task learning technique to meet the security and privacy constraints of HDT and employed a single server discrete-time batch-service queue framework when characterizing the batching process to reduce the communication burden. Furthermore, we introduced a prediction verification framework to improve the performance of the proposed PeHDT framework. The resulting problem was formulated as a constrained Markov decision process and was solved by introducing a primary-dual deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Through a joint investigation of communication, batching and prediction verification schemes, the simulation results show that the proposed PeHDT framework can greatly reduce both the VT-experienced delay and the PT-VT communication time without compromising the specific requirements of HDT.",

        "abstract": "Edge storage is becoming an increasingly appealing alternative for data owners (DOs), offering benefits like decreased latency and minimized bandwidth usage compared to traditional cloud storage solutions. Nonetheless, stored data within edge servers (ESs) remains vulnerable to disruptions. Existing data integrity auditing schemes face challenges such as the costs of third-party auditors (TPA), unreliable and delayed audit results, and effective management of data inspection concerning time and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce DIVO, a decentralized data inspection approach. DIVO leverages ESs as each others' auditors, removing the necessity for a centralized party, thereby mitigating collision risks and potential biases in audit results. We propose a game-theoretic technique to efficiently manage data inspection and verification offloading to ESs. By formulating the decision-making issue as a strategic game for optimally allocating verification tasks among multiple ESs, we establish the presence of Nash equilibrium and design a strategy to attain it. Through comprehensive security and performance evaluations, DIVO has been shown to operate securely within the random oracle model while delivering notable efficiency improvements over recent methods. Our analysis highlights that DIVO surpasses a wide range of recent approaches in both communication and computation efficiency.",

        "abstract": "With continuous development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), intelligence is gradually becoming the mainstream trend of future transportation. However, the increasing number of vehicles and their high mobility also bring greater challenges to privacy and security. Most of the current authentication schemes in IoV focus on a single domain, ignoring the cross-domain requirements brought by high mobility. To address these issues better, we propose an efficient anonymous cross-domain authentication scheme EACAS based on elliptic curve cryptography within the certificate-less cryptography. We incorporate the secret sharing with digital signature to provide the trustworthy authentication for cross-domain vehicles, and the batch verification improves the efficiency of authentication. Besides, we also propose a hierarchical pseudonym method for multi-domain scenarios, allowing vehicles to update pseudonyms at arbitrary locations and can be revealed. The formal security proof and analysis demonstrate the security characteristics, and the comprehensive performance evaluation shows the efficiency.",

        "abstract": "With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive usersâ information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.",

        "abstract": "A vulnerability or error in a smart contract will lead to serious consequences including loss of assets and leakage of user privacy. Established smart contract vulnerability detection tools define vulnerabilities through symbolic execution, fuzz testing, and other methods requiring extremely specialized security knowledge. Even so, with the development of vulnerability exploitation techniques, vulnerability detection tools customized by experts cannot cope with the deformation of existing vulnerabilities or unknown vulnerabilities. The vulnerability detection based on machine learning developed in recent years studies vulnerabilities from different dimensions and designs corresponding models to achieve a high detection rate. However, these methods usually only focus on some features of smart contracts, or the model itself does not have universality. Experimental results on the publicly large-scale dataset SmartBugs-Wild demonstrate that this paper's method not only outperforms existing methods in several metrics, but also is scalable, general, and requires less domain knowledge, providing a new idea for the development of smart contract vulnerability detection.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios prominently feature resource access, information sharing for user navigation and infrastructure-based communications. External attackers and illegitimate data circulations are thwarted primarily through secure sharing and access controls. Authenticity, accessibility, and privacy of shared information resources might be affected if adverse and unauthorized access or false access are allowed to enter in IoV networks. This article provides an augmenting security approach for handling multi-vehicle resource access requests and sharing. The approach named as Dynamic Secure Multi-Access Scheme (DSMAS) that formulates access policies with amendments from the interacting infrastructure units. The amendments are identified from the resource access span and access success ratio observed in a series of intervals. Support vectors play a crucial role in the amendment decision-making process by effectively mitigating the risks associated with incorrect and delayed accesses. The intervals during which access is provided to vehicles are secured by the utilization of two-factor authentication keys for a specified period. In this process, the key validity relies on the interval time for which the access is granted. The dynamic nature of the system enables the adaptation of connection handovers and resource availability to comply with the access policies of the cloud infrastructure. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is assessed by the evaluation of access time, success rate, authentication time, and disconnection ratio, revealing its superiority over existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "The interconnected environment of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) facilitates the development of various low-carbon and secure location-based services. However, sharing data with semi-trusted service providers poses serious security risks. In particular, it can threaten the confidentiality of past messages after the leakage of the userâs key. In this paper, we propose an efficient and forward-secure conditional privacy-preserving scheme for IoV, namely EFSC. We construct a cryptographic method with forward secrecy in the proposed EFSC scheme, which ensures the confidentiality of past messages even after the userâs secret key has been compromised. This method incorporates key derivation functionality and efficiently addresses the complex certificate management issue with the assistance of smart contracts. Additionally, the designed smart contract facilitates authentication. We analyze and prove that the proposed EFSC scheme satisfies the proposed privacy and security requirements with better security performance. We use Goerli, an Ethernet test network, to deploy customized smart contracts to prove its feasibility. Furthermore, the proposed EFSC scheme exhibits high index generation and pairing efficiency and realizes less computational and communication overhead. Compared with the existing schemes, its computational overhead in message signing, signature verification, and user revocation can be reduced by up to 95.61%, 36.53%, and 67.01%, respectively. Moreover, the communication overhead for initiating a location service query is only 0.3760 KB. These results show that the proposed EFSC scheme has certain advantages regarding efficiency and security.",

        "abstract": "The diffusion of the much-anticipated metaverse seems to have stalled. However, the industrial metaverse, aimed at facilitating human-machine interaction and streamlining operational processes, is credited with transformative potential. Due to a fragmented and contested information landscape regarding the industrial metaverse, the future of this technology in business practice remains uncertain. In our study, we contribute to this debate by addressing the question of how the industrial metaverse will shape the operations of companies in the mid-term future. We developed 20 projections on the future of the industrial metaverse based on the current literature, and employed a Delphi approach using input from 33 selected experts to form a scenario for the industrial metaverse in the year 2033. We uncover realistic potentials and challenges that need to be addressed to make the industrial metaverse a reality. Accordingly, the industrial metaverse in 2033 is still not fully developed, which causes a divide between companies that already are using the industrial metaverse and companies that have not yet implemented it. In perspective, our findings provide insight into what needs to be considered for proactive industrial metaverse strategies.",

        "abstract": "The smart grid, which integrates ubiquitous computing, powerful sensor devices, and wireless communication technologies, is regarded as the new generation of grid system. However, privacy concerns have hindered the widespread adoption of smart grids. Numerous protocols for data aggregation with privacy-preserving features in smart grids have been proposed, but the majority rely on gateways for data aggregation and transmission. The nature of these protocols is hop-by-hop-based, which inevitably leads to a single point of compromise. On the other hand, the communication method used in data aggregation protocols for mobile sensing is end-to-end, which can address the issue of single point compromise in the smart grid. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the smart grid that supports billing computation and leakage detection. The framework is highly efficient for smart meters, as it requires the transmission of only a single piece of data in each sensing period, which can be utilized for two types of aggregation simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework effectively mitigates collusion attacks, achieves high leakage detection rate, and offers advantages in terms of communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, a multitude of sensing devices continually gather critical data. These data are indispensable for the operations and advancements across diverse industries. However, the sharing of these data poses privacy threats, with attackers exploiting channel analysis and physical device attacks to access sensitive data. To address this, we propose a privacy protection scheme that combines smart contracts, key-insulated technology, and certificateless blind signature. This scheme aims to ensure data privacy during sharing and maintain user anonymity. By leveraging smart contracts, our scheme enables fair and automated key distribution, replacing traditional key generation centers. Key-insulated technology ensures that the signerâs key changes periodically, enhancing system stability. The security of our solution is validated through a random oracle model, and we have optimized an elliptic curve point to reduce signature length and minimize communication overhead. Our scheme outperforms other certificateless blind signature schemes in terms of computational and communication efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper formalises watchtower and its different properties including agility , privacy against both watchtower and third parties, fairness with respect to both watchtower and its client and coverage . We also evaluate the existing schemes regarding these properties and show they cannot achieve all properties altogether. Furthermore, we prove that there is a trade-off between the level of fairness that a watchtower provides to its clients and the coverage it can achieve. We also introduce FPPW, the first Fair and Privacy-Preserving Watchtower for Bitcoin. This new scheme provides fairness with respect to all channel participants including both channel parties and the watchtower. It means the funds of any honest channel participants are safe even assuming that the other two participants are corrupted and/or collude with each other. Furthermore, the watchtower in FPPW learns no information about the off-chain transactions and hence FPPW provides privacy against the watchtower. We also show that FPPW coverage, i.e. the total capacity of channels that an FPPW watchtower can cover, is higher than that of PISA and Cerberus and FPPW can be implemented without any update in the Bitcoin script.",

        "abstract": "In order to solve the problem that high-priority tasks can not be processed timely and reliably due to the disorder of multi-task and dynamicity in power Internet of Things(PIoTs), a high-reliability small-area task offloading mechanism with trust evaluation and fuzzy logic(HRSATF) is proposed. Firstly, considering task priority, preemptive priority queue is introduced to ensure high-priority tasks processed preferentially, and minimum resource allocation coefficients(MRACs) of tasks are solved to ensure the effectiveness of offloading. Secondly, the trust model between smart device(SD) and edge server(ES) is established, and ESs are divided into three priorities based on trust value and computing power by fast non-dominated sorting. Thirdly, fuzzy logic is applied to select target ES when the priorities of task and ES do not match or the ES is offline, and MRAC is used to schedule tasks between SD and ES. Finally, NSGA2 is modified (MNSGA2) to verify the effectiveness of HRSATF in terms of success rate, time, power consumption and load balancing, where success rate is increased by $102.3\\%$ , and time and power consumption are decreased by $90.7\\%$ , $89.3\\%$ at most, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Smart contracts manage numerous digital assets, their security requirements are particularly prominent. Testing is an effective way to ensure the reliability of smart contracts. Current test case generation methods do not consider the impact of state variables and cross-contract calls on constraint conditions, leading to low test coverage for cross-contracts. In this regard, we propose a Cross-contract Data flow Analysis based Test case Generation (CDA-TG) method for Ethereum smart contracts. First, for each function in the target contract, CDA-TG generates its invocation sequence based on the principle of prioritizing functions that define or modify state variables. Then, for each parameter, CDA-TG performs cross-contract data flow analysis on the target contract, extracting the hard-coded values to build its parameter input pool. On this basis, CDA-TG applies the function invocation sequences to generate an initial set of test cases, where the value of each parameter is selected randomly from its parameter input pool. Finally, to further improve the branch coverage, CDA-TG applies the multiobjective sorting algorithm DynaMOSA to optimize the initial test cases. Our empirical study on 66 real smart contracts verified that CDA-TG can significantly improve the branch coverage of smart contracts, with a 8.86% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art test case generation method AGSolT in cross-contract scenario.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of consumer electronics technology has greatly promoted the progress of the metaverse. However, as a digitized virtual environment, the metaverse imposes high demands on the security of user identities and assets. In this context, asynchronous remote distributed key generation has become one of the key technologies to ensure the security of the metaverse. Unlike traditional key generation methods, the asynchronous nature makes the distributed key generation process more flexible, helping to address the dynamic and heterogeneous network environment within the metaverse. This paper proposes an asynchronous remote key generation method. This method employs public-key cryptography and basic asynchronous primitives to accomplish remote key generation and exchange through encryption and decryption operations between different nodes. In comparison to traditional methods, the asynchronous remote key generation approach provides higher security and reliability, while also showcasing increased efficiency and flexibility.",

        "abstract": "With the accelerated growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), secure and efficient task offloading of vehicle has emerged as a critical challenge, particularly in highway scenarios. Traditional Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) solutions face significant limitations in these environments due to frequent link disruptions and the dynamic nature of vehicle movements. Platoon offloading is considered a feasible solution, to address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic pricing-based task offloading and resource allocation scheme specifically tailored for vehicle platoons, integrating robust data security measures. Our scheme employs a Stackelberg game framework to model the interaction between task vehicles and platoon members, ensuring fair compensation for resource allocation while maintaining low latency. We introduce a personalized security layer utilizing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption to safeguard platoon communications, a critical enhancement given the vulnerability of wireless channels. Our scheme not only proves the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium but also optimizes the utility for both task vehicles and platoon members through a dynamic pricing-based Stackelberg game (DPSG) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that DPSG can substantially improve entire performance compared to other schemes, such as local execution, MEC offloading scheme, Hooke-Jeeves-based Stackelberg game algorithm and RL-based offloading optimal scheme.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the consequences of phishing scams on Ethereum have adversely affected the stability of the crypto-currency environment. Numerous incidents have been reported that have resulted in a substantial loss of cryptocurrency. The existing literature in this area primarily leverages traditional feature engineering or network representation learning to recover crucial information from transaction records to identify suspected users. However, these methods mainly rely on handcrafted feature engineering or conventional node representation learning from a static network while ignoring the network dynamism and inherent temporal sparsity in the user behavior that results in underperformance after an extended period. This article proposes a novel sparsity-aware tensor decomposition-based architecture: SpaTeD , which retrieves efficient user representation utilizing the evolving transaction and structural information and subsequently mitigates the temporal sparsity problem. Our model is evaluated on a real-world Ethereum phishing scam dataset and reports a significant performance improvement over the baselines (96% recall and 96% F1-score ). We have conducted an extensive set of experiments to verify the temporal robustness of the model. Additionally, we have provided the ablation study to demonstrate the contribution of each component of the framework.",

        "abstract": "Online syndicated lending offers quick and convenient financing support to individuals, while diversifying risks by pooling funds from multiple lenders into loan projects. It has experienced explosive growth, reaching a multibillion-dollar market. Establishing transparency is essential for constructing a trusted, fair, and regulation-compliant financial collaboration model. Meanwhile, confidentiality must be maintained to protect the sensitive financial information of individual lenders. Multi-party computation (MPC) can protect the input privacy of lenders, but it cannot safeguard the sensitive information revealed by the fund flow itself. To address these challenges, we propose a new collaborative financial ledger for online syndicated lending. It leverages homomorphic encryption/commitment to enable the reuse of intermediary states without compromising privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of a loan. This system also supports efficient regulation-compliant auditing. We streamline the framework design to optimize performance and develop a prototype system. Even with a large syndicate of 100 lenders, the system still achieves low-latency performance.",

        "abstract": "Drawing on the concept of âtechwashingâ, i.e. claiming to be more technologically proficient than you really are, we here conceptualize and explain a marked tendency in practice for firms to expand on this label, attempting to describe themselves as good tech companies , i.e. technology companies that serve a greater good and act in accordance with ethical values and societal norms . Our conceptual framework introduces the â tech theaterâ label and describes the good tech company role that is being played and how it is being perceived by the outside world. We explicate how the so-called âtech theatreâ plays out, i.e. the disconnect between a communicated and enacted corporate identity, the mismatch of which is grounded in exaggerated âgood tech companyâ aims and claims . We posit that this helps us to understand the behavior of many leading tech companies, as the narrative of good tech companies comprises an important explanatory mechanism of their behavior. In so doing, we seek to contribute to the burgeoning literature on the theatrics of tech companies, and help guide technical managers out of the theater.",

        "abstract": "To enhance the privacy of messages in Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), it is critical to preserve the communication security between Road Side Unit (RSU) and numerous vehicles. The primitive of signcryption is introduced to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity and unforgeability of transmitted messages. Nevertheless, the existing signcryption schemes fail to achieve a balance between security and efficiency. In this paper, we construct a Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) empowered certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme with key agreement (CASKA-CRT). As the vehicle joins and leaves dynamically, the proposed scheme can ensure the dynamic security via one modulo division operation. Besides, the certificateless aggregate signcryption and key agreement mechanisms are embedded. The former idea can both address the certificate management and key escrow problems, while the latter technology can create authentication as a premise of secure communication. Based on this construction, the hash-to-group operation and bilinear pairing are avoided, to realize a faster verification with the increased number of messages. Moreover, the security of proposed scheme is proved under the random oracle model. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates the advantage of CASKA-CRT in terms of security and reliability over related works.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle platooning benefits significantly from the Consensus Speed Advisory System (CSAS), an emerging technology that recommends a consensus speed to reduce energy consumption. However, managing trust to ensure system security and identify malicious nodes poses a considerable challenge in these autonomous environments. Furthermore, while CSAS optimizes the total energy consumption of the platoon, it may inadvertently result in increased energy use for specific vehicles, discouraging their continued participation and hindering an efficient formation of a platoon. This paper proposes a trust-aware and decentralized speed advisory system (TD-SAS) to address these challenges. TD-SAS employs a consortium blockchain for managing trust nodes, providing non-repudiation and tamper resistance for reputation data. Capitalizing on this platform, we use a multi-weight subjective logic model for precise reputation value calculation. Additionally, we present a trust-aware consensus speed recommendation scheme capable of adapting its recommendations to vehicular reputation variations. To mitigate the potential disincentives for vehicles experiencing increased energy consumption, we incorporate an incentive mechanism to encourage their re-engagement with TD-SAS. Comprehensive security analysis and extensive simulation experiments confirm the robustness and effectiveness of TD-SAS, emphasizing its potential for enhancing the energy efficiency and security of autonomous vehicle platoons.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), vehicles will generate massive data and computation demands, necessitating computation offloading at the edge. However, existing research faces challenges in efficiency and trust. In this paper, we explore the IoV computation offloading from both user and edge facility provider perspectives, working to optimize the quality of experience (QoE), load balancing, and success rate based on challenges to efficiency and trust. Firstly, two vehicle interconnection models are constructed to extend the linkable range of intra-road and inter-road vehicles while considering the maximum link time constraint. Then, a dynamic planning method is proposed, combining the reputation and feedback mechanisms, which can schedule edge resources online based on the cumulative computation latency of each service side, reliability value, and historical behavior. These two phases further improve the efficiency of edge services. Subsequently, blockchain is combined to optimize the trust problem of edge collaboration, and an edge-limited Byzantine fault tolerance local consensus mechanism is proposed to optimize consensus efficiency and ensure the reliability of edge services. Finally, this paper conducts dynamic experiments on real-world datasets, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and models in multiple vehicle density datasets and experimental scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative driving is an emerging paradigm aimed at enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. To ensure successful cooperation, road users must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore, vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or misbehaving nodes, while also considering the inherent constraints of the wireless medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading with minimal overhead. To achieve this, VEE comprises data associated with blockchain techniques, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based mechanics. Using this mechanism, we piggyback new protocols on the existing ITS traffic, minimally impacting the vehicular network. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the VEE extension in overcoming the challenges posed by...",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond 5G (B5G) are crucial for revolutionizing various industries, including surveillance, agriculture, and logistics, by enabling high-speed data transfer, ultra-low latency communication, and ultra-reliable connectivity. However, integrating UAVs into B5G networks poses various security and privacy concerns. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks which jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Moreover, UAVs in B5G networks are also at high risk from the application of machine learning (ML)-based attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial manipulation, data poisoning and model evasion techniques, which can compromise the integrity of UAV operations, lead to navigation errors, and expose sensitive data collected by UAVs. Considering the aforementioned security and privacy concerns, this review article presents emerging security and privacy solutions for UAVs in B5G networks. Firstly, We introduce the essential background of integrating UAVs into B5G networks and discuss the advantages and security challenges which the emerging integrated network architecture have. Then, we proceed to analyze and examine the security and privacy landscape by including threats and requirements of UAVs in B5G networks. Based on these threats and requirements, solutions from physical layer security (PLS), blockchain (BC), federated learning (FL) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are discussed and explored in details. Moreover, potential future research directions are discussed in details as open research issues.",

This paper focuses on the application of PBFT consensus mechanism in the Internet of things. However, it is found that the current PBFT consensus mechanisms need to address some problems, such as communication overhead, bandwidth occupation and privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a voting sorting clustering mechanism based on group signatures to enhance the PBFT consensus mechanism (IPBFT), ensuring privacy protection between Internet of Things nodes. Finally, the communication efficiency is improved. The voting sorting clustering method reduces the communication probability with the nodes, and decreases the communication overhead and bandwidth occupation. Experimental results show that compared with other mechanisms, the proposed mechanism increases throughput, reduces communication overhead and bandwidth occupation, and alleviates privacy protection problems.",

        "abstract": "Traffic classification occupies a significant role in cybersecurity and network management. The widespread of encryption transmission protocols such as SSL/TLS has led to the dominance of deep learning based approaches. In cybersecurity, strong adversaries often complicate their strategies by constantly developing emerging attacks. Meanwhile, security practitioners desire to grasp the reasons for inference results. However, existing deep learning approaches lack efficient adaptation for incremental traffic types and often have less interpretability. In this paper, we propose I\n2\nRNN, an Incremental and Interpretable Recurrent Neural Network for encrypted traffic classification. The I\n2\nRNN proposes a novel propagation process to extract the sequence fingerprints from sessions with local robustness. Meanwhile, this proposal provides interpretability including time-series feature attribution and inter-class similarity portrait. Moreover, we design I\n2\nRNN in an incremental manner to adapt to emerging traffic types. The I\n2\nRNN only needs to train an additional set of parameters for the newly added traffic type rather than retraining the whole model with the entire dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our I\n2\nRNN can achieve remarkable performance in traffic classification, incremental learning, and model interpretability.

        "abstract": "Traffic detection systems based on machine learning have been proposed to defend against cybersecurity threats, such as intrusion attacks and malware. However, they did not take the impact of network-induced phenomena into consideration, such as packet loss, retransmission, and out-of-order. These phenomena will introduce additional misclassifications in the real world. In this paper, we present\nERNN\n, a robust and end-to-end RNN model that is specially designed against network-induced phenomena. As its core,\nERNN\nis designed with a novel gating unit named as session gate that includes: (i) four types of actions to simulate common network-induced phenomena during model training; and (ii) the Mealy machine to update states of session gate that adjusts the probability distribution of network-induced phenomena. Taken together,\nERNN\nadvances state-of-the-art by realizing the model robustness for network-induced phenomena in an error-resilient manner. We implement\nERNN\nand evaluate it extensively on both intrusion detection and malware detection systems. By practical evaluation with dynamic bandwidth utilization and different network topologies, we demonstrate that\nERNN\ncan still identify 98.63% of encrypted intrusion traffic when facing about 16% abnormal packet sequences on a 10 Gbps dataplane. Similarly,\nERNN\ncan still robustly identify more than 97% of the encrypted malware traffic in multi-user concurrency scenarios.\nERNN\ncan realize\nâ¼\n4% accuracy more than SOTA methods. Based on the Integrated Gradients method, we interpret the gating mechanism can reduce the dependencies on local packets (termed dependency dispersion ). Moreover, we demonstrate that\nERNN\npossesses superior stability and scalability in terms of parameter settings and feature selection.",

        "abstract": "With wide applications of image editing tools, forged images (splicing, copy-move, removal and etc.) have been becoming great public concerns. Although existing image forgery localization methods could achieve fairly good results on several public datasets, most of them perform poorly when the forged images are JPEG compressed as they are usually done in social networks. To tackle this issue, in this paper, a self-supervised domain adaptation network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery detection and localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to approximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics. The backbone network is then trained with domain adaptation strategy to localize the tampering boundary and region, and alleviate the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images. Extensive experimental results on several public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms or rivals to other state-of-the-art methods in image forgery detection and localization, especially for JPEG compression with unknown QFs.",

        "abstract": "With the development of various applications, such as recommendation systems and social network analysis, graph data have been ubiquitous in the real world. However, graphs usually suffer from being absent during data collection due to copyright restrictions or privacy-protecting policies. The graph absence could be roughly grouped into attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing cases. Specifically, attribute-incomplete indicates that a portion of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete, while attribute-missing indicates that all attribute vectors of partial nodes are missing. Although various graph imputation methods have been proposed, none of them is custom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph absence exist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel graph imputation network termed revisiting initializing then refining (RITR), where both attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples are completed under the guidance of a novel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to complete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete attributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a structure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by approximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order structure matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding initialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating the reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic affinity structure. To the best of our knowledge, this newly designed method is the first end-to-end unsupervised framework dedicated to handling hybrid-absent graphs. Extensive experiments on six datasets have verified that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art competitors. Our source code is available at https://github....",

        "abstract": "Clear visibility of the road is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but adverse weather conditions can significantly reduce road visibility, impacting their performance. To address this challenge, a visibility restoration model is essential for autonomous driving and navigation. This paper proposes a Lightweight Visibility Restoration Network (LVR-Net) designed to restore images with improved spatial and spectral information despite severe weather degradation. Initially, a Deep MultiPatch Hierarchical Network (DMPHN) is employed, but its computational demands hinder deployment on autonomous vehicles. To overcome this, a Modified Adaptive distributed Differential Evolution (MADE) optimization technique is applied to enhance the network's size, computational speed, and overall performance. A multi-objective fitness function based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), memory size, and computational speed is formulated. Benchmark datasets are utilized to train, validate, and test the LVR-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LVR-Net outperforms other competitive models across various performance metrics. Additionally, its compact size (48.25MB) and faster scene restoration make it highly suitable for deployment in autonomous vehicles.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of evaluating arbitrary multivariate polynomials over a massive dataset containing multiple inputs, on a distributed computing system with a master node and multiple worker nodes. Generalized Lagrange Coded Computing (GLCC) codes are proposed to simultaneously provide resiliency against stragglers who do not return computation results in time, security against adversarial workers who deliberately modify results for their benefit, and information-theoretic privacy of the dataset amidst possible collusion of workers. GLCC codes are constructed by first partitioning the dataset into multiple groups, then encoding the dataset using carefully designed interpolating polynomials, and sharing multiple encoded data points to each worker, such that interference computation results across groups can be eliminated at the master. Particularly, GLCC codes include the state-of-the-art Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) codes as a special case, and exhibit a more flexible tradeoff between communication and computation overheads in optimizing system efficiency. Furthermore, we apply GLCC to distributed training of machine learning models, and demonstrate that GLCC codes achieve a speedup of up to 2.5â3.9Ã over LCC codes in training time, across experiments for training image classifiers on different datasets, model architectures, and straggler patterns.",

        "abstract": "Pixel value ordering (PVO) is an efficient method for implementing reversible data hiding, which can achieve embedding based on overlapping pixel blocks when combined with the flexible patch moving (FPM) mode, especially the two-dimensional (2D) FPM mode. However, the existing 2D FPM mode, whose pairing way of prediction error is not conducive to generating more pixel blocks available for embedding, and whose movement rules are too inefficient to fully exploit the potential of the PVO, results in wasting many available blocks. Therefore, in this paper, a two-stage embedding mechanism is proposed for the 2D FPM mode, in which the combination of prediction errors is adjusted to improve the possibility of generating available blocks and the two-stage embedding doubles the number of pixel blocks available for embedding. Furthermore, an FPM mode selection is proposed, where four novel 2D FPM modes are designed to efficiently exploit the potential of the PVO according to the different directional gradients. Lastly, a set of efficient 2D mappings is well-designed for multiple histograms to achieve lower embedding distortion. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of embedding capacity and image fidelity. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio for the Kodak image dataset is as high as 63.62 dB after embedding 10,000 bits.",

        "abstract": "An effective auto-scaling framework is essential for microservices to ensure performance stability and resource efficiency under dynamic workloads. As revealed by many prior studies, the key to efficient auto-scaling lies in accurately learning performance patterns, i.e., the relationship between performance metrics and workloads in data-driven schemes. However, we notice that there are two significant challenges in characterizing performance patterns for large-scale microservices. Firstly, diverse microservices demonstrate varying sensitivities to heterogeneous machines, causing difficulty in quantifying the performance difference in a fixed manner. Secondly, frequent version upgrades of microservices result in uncertain changes in performance patterns, known as pattern drifts, leading to imprecise resource capacity estimation issues. To address these challenges, we propose Humas, a heterogeneity- and upgrade-aware auto-scaling framework for large-scale microservices. Firstly, Humas quantifies the difference in resource efficiency among heterogeneous machines for various microservices online and normalizes their resources in standard units. Additionally, Humas develops a least-squares density-difference (LSDD) based algorithm to identify pattern drifts caused by upgrades. Lastly, Humas generates capacity adjustment plans for microservices based on the latest performance patterns and predicted workloads. The experiment results conducted on 50 real microservices with over 11,000 containers demonstrate that Humas improves resource efficiency and performance stability by approximately 30.4% and 48.0%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "DLLAD methods may underperform in severely imbalanced datasets. Although data resampling has proven effective in other software engineering tasks, it has not been explored in LAD. This study aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of the impact of diverse data resampling methods on existing DLLAD approaches from two distinct perspectives. Firstly, we assess the performance of these DLLAD approaches across four datasets with different levels of class imbalance, and we explore the impact of resampling ratios of normal to abnormal data on DLLAD approaches. Secondly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the data resampling methods when utilizing optimal resampling ratios of normal to abnormal data. Our findings indicate that oversampling methods generally outperform undersampling and hybrid sampling methods. Data resampling on raw data yields superior results compared to data resampling in the feature space. These improvements are attributed to the increased attention given to important tokens. By exploring the resampling ratio of normal to abnormal data, we suggest generating more data for minority classes through oversampling while removing less data from majority classes through undersampling. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the intricate relationship between data resampling methods and DLLAD. By addressing the challenge of class imbalance, researchers and practitioners can enhance DLLAD performance.",

First, by formulating the DOA estimation problem as a multi-label classification task, the multi-channel training data is constructed from the real covariance matrix under low SNRs. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is introduced as a controller to guide the process of architecture search and optimal cell selection. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity without compromising performance, the computationally intensive operations are transformed into more efficient alternatives within the optimal cell via architecture transformation. Simulation results show that the proposed OAST-DOA method has significant advantages for scenarios with low SNRs and a relatively small number of snapshots, and exhibits robustness against array model errors.",

        "abstract": "To ensure the privacy and security of charging services under Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) environment, it is critical to secure the charging stations (CSs) interaction with multiple electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we construct a heterogeneous broadcast signcryption protocol supporting equality test for IoVs (HBSC-ET), which addresses the communication problem between a CS and EVs featured with One-to-Many properties. In our design, the CS is allocated in public key infrastructure cryptosystem (PKI), while the EVs are equipped in identity-based cryptography (IBC). In order to address the restriction of EVs storage resources, the received ciphertexts at EV side, are alternatively uploaded to cloud server running equality test. Here, the cloud server legitimately executes the equality test, to determine whether two ciphertexts conclude the same message without unsigncryption. With this, the design HBSC-ET is advanced in terms of information utilization ratio. Finally, the rigorous experiment as well as performance analysis elaborate that our proposed scheme is more suitable for charging services in IoVs.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing scale and complexity of online activities, accountability, as an after-the-fact mechanism, has become an effective complementary approach to ensure system security. Decades of research have delved into the connotation of accountability. They fail, however, to achieve practical accountability of decryption. This paper seeks to address this gap. We consider the scenario where a client (called encryptor, her) encrypts her data and then chooses a delegate (a.k.a. decryptor, him) that stores data for her. If the decryptor initiates an illegitimate decryption on the encrypted data, there is a non-negligible probability that this behavior will be detected, thereby holding the decryptor accountable for his decryption. We make three contributions. First, we review key definitions of accountability known so far. Based on extensive investigations, we formalize new definitions of accountability specifically targeting the decryption process, denoted as accountable decryption , and discuss the (im)possibilities when capturing this concept. We also define the security goals in correspondence. Second, we present a novel Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)-assisted solution aligning with definitions. Instead of fully trusting TEE, we take a further step, making TEE work in the âtrust, but verifyâ model where we trust TEE and use its service, but empower users (i.e., decryptors) to detect the potentially compromised state of TEEs. Third, we implement a full-fledged system and conduct a series of evaluations. The results demonstrate that our solution is efficient. Even in a scenario involving 300, 000 log entries, the decryption process concludes in approximately 5.5ms, and malicious decryptors can be identified within 69ms.",

        "abstract": "Crowdsourcing has been playing an essential role in machine learning since it can obtain a large number of labels in an economical and fast manner for training increasingly complex learning models. However, the application of crowdsourcing learning still faces several challenges such as the low quality of crowd labels and the urgent requirement for learning models adapting to the label noises. There have been many studies focusing on truth inference algorithms to improve the quality of labels obtained by crowdsourcing. Comparably, end-to-end predictive model learning in crowdsourcing scenarios, especially using cutting-edge deep learning techniques, is still in its infant stage. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network-based framework, namely CGNNAT, which models the correlation of instances by combining the GCN model with an attention mechanism to learn more representative node embeddings for a better understanding of the bias tendency of crowd workers. Furthermore, a specific projection processing layer is employed in CGNNAT to model the reliability of each crowd worker, which makes the model an end-to-end neural network directly trained by noisy crowd labels. Experimental results on several real-world and synthetic datasets show that the proposed CGNNAT outperforms state-of-the-art and classical methods in terms of label prediction.",

        "abstract": "Drug combination therapy is crucial in cancer treatment, but accurately predicting drug synergy remains a challenge due to the complexity of drug combinations. Machine learning and deep learning models have shown promise in drug combination prediction, but they suffer from issues such as gradient vanishing, overfitting, and parameter tuning. To address these problems, the deep drug synergy prediction network, named as EDNet is proposed that leverages a modified triangular mutation-based differential evolution algorithm. This algorithm evolves the initial connection weights and architecture-related attributes of the deep bidirectional mixture density network, improving its performance and addressing the aforementioned issues. EDNet automatically extracts relevant features and provides conditional probability distributions of output attributes. The performance of EDNet is evaluated over two well-known drug synergy datasets, NCI-ALMANAC and deep-synergy. The results demonstrate that EDNet outperforms the competing models. EDNet facilitates efficient drug interactions, enhancing the overall effectiveness of drug combinations for improved cancer treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "We explore the reasons for the poorer feature extraction ability of vanilla convolution and discover that there mainly exist three key factors that restrict its representation capability, i.e. regular sampling, static aggregation and limited receptive field. With the cost of extra parameters and computations, existing approaches merely alleviate part of the limitations. It drives us to seek a more lightweight operator to further improve the extracted image features. Through a closer examination of the convolution process, we discover that it is composed of two distinct interactions: spatial-wise interaction and channel-wise interaction. Based on this discovery, we decouple the convolutional blocks into these two interactions which not only reduces the parameters and computations but also enables a richer ensemble of interactions. Then, we propose the Dynamically and Globally Enhanced Convolution (DGeC), which includes several components as follows: a Dynamic Area Perceptor block (DAP) ...",

        "abstract": "Network slicing is a key technology in sixth-generation (6G) communication networks. However, the performance of virtualized nodes sharing cache resources in 6G network slicing is degraded by the inappropriate allocation of resources. This paper proposes a cache resource allocation strategy for 6G network slicing based on game dynamics (RASGD). A 6G slicing network model is developed that describes the relationship between virtualized node mapping and resource sharing, and an evolutionary public goods game cache resource allocation (PGGRA) method is proposed to improve data transmission performance. This strategy defines the cache resource gap and selects the input cost according to the cache resource gap and evolutionary game strategy. When the cache resources are sufficient, the input is carried out, and when the cache resources are insufficient or the demand is large, unnecessary input is reduced to avoid the waste of resources, so as to achieve the intelligent allocation of cache resource. Simulation results demonstrate that the RASGD strategy improves the successful arrival rate of slice packets by at least 4.79% and improves the network congestion by at least 22.9% compared with the resource allocation strategy based on number of nodes (RANN) and resource allocation strategy based on node degree (RAND).",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of spaceâairâground integrated technology has laid a foundation for achieving wide area wireless communication coverage, but its applicability is limited due to the limited computational capacity and energy storage of the terminal devices. This paper thus proposes a spaceâairâground integrated mobile edge computing (MEC) task offloading and computing resource allocation (SIMOC) algorithm. First, a spaceâairâground integrated MEC system is designed in which the terminal devices in the system can offload tasks to air-and space-based servers while performing energy harvesting. Second, an optimization objective of maximizing the task execution benefit minus the sum cost of task offloading and execution is established, for which the problem is transformed into a time-slot-based minimization problem of queue-stability minus revenue using Lyapunov optimization. Finally, the energy harvesting and task offloading subproblems of the queue-stability-minus-revenue problem are solved respectively to maximize the total revenue while ensuring device stability. Simulation results show that the SIMOC algorithm can reduce the all-task completion time by up to 98.16% compared with only local task execution algorithm in the absence of newly added tasks and shows good performance in handling newly added tasks. Meanwhile, the SIMOC algorithm has better performance compared to particle swarm optimization algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Byzantine agreement is the most fundamental primitive in distributed computing. All known Byzantine agreement protocols achieve quadratic or sub-quadratic messages and communication. We show that surprisingly, by directly assuming a random leader election oracle (that can be built from the verifiable random function), threshold signatures, and the 1/3 corruption bound, we can build Linear-BA, a binary agreement (BA) that has linear message complexity, constant expected time complexity, and a normal case that has linear communication. We extend Linear-BA to construct Linear-MBA, a multi-valued Byzantine agreement (MBA) protocol also with O ( n ) messages and O (1) expected time. Finally, we present Linear-MBA-SV, an MBA protocol with the strong validity property via a no-cost transformation from Linear-MBA. All the protocols above are secure under a static adversary, where a static adversary corrupts a set of replicas at the beginning of the protocol. We go on and show an impossibility result that in the adaptive adversary model (in which the adversary can selectively corrupt the replicas while the protocol is running), one cannot build a Byzantine agreement protocol with O ( n ) messages and O (1) expected time. Accordingly, we revise our protocol to obtain Byzantine agreement protocols with O ( n ) messages per round and O ( n ) time. Our results offer a fresh view of what is needed for linear Byzantine agreement: by examining the âneeded\" assumptions, one can identify the performance bottlenecks for Byzantine agreement. Meanwhile, all our protocols are efficient, as all the building blocks have efficient instantiations.",

        "abstract": "The problem of designing explicit bent and plateaued functions has been researched for several decades. However, finding new bent functions outside the well-known completed Maiorana-McFarland class M # is still a challenge. Plateaued functions have been characterized in many different ways, but there is no general and rigorous mathematical method to generate them directly, except for the ones in the spirit of the well-known Maiorana-McFarland constructions or those obtained through adaptations of the secondary constructions of bent functions. Jeong and Lee recently made significant advances regarding algorithms for constructing balanced plateaued functions with maximal algebraic degrees in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 70(2), 1408-1421, 2024]. Due to the gap between our significant interest in the notion of plateaued functions and the knowledge we have on it, our motivation is to bring further results on the constructions of plateaued functions that allow us to understand their structure better. This article creates a framework of new generic constructions of bent and plateaued functions by studying Boolean functions of the form h ( x ) = f ( x )+ F ( f 1 ( x ),â¦ fr ( x )), where fi ( x ) = f ( x )+ f ( x +Î¼ i ) for each 1 â¤ i â¤ r . We firstly prove that h and f have the same extended Walsh-Hadamard spectrum if D Î¼i D Î¼j f = 0 for any 1 â¤ i < j â¤ r . This result extends a previous construction of bent functions to any Boolean functions. The strength of such a result is that it allows us to obtain several plateaued functions of high algebraic degrees from known ones with low algebraic degrees, which was a significant and challenging problem raised in the literature. Such a result is a real challenge and breaks a deadlock since no mathematical method allows the general constructions of plateaued functions. We next give an extended affine equivalent form of the function h , which provides us with another compelling perspective to design new bent func...",

        "abstract": "The integration of psychological art therapy with consumer electronics has opened new avenues for improving mental health care. This study proposes a multi-feature user behavior modeling framework designed to enhance the effectiveness of art therapy delivered through consumer electronics by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques. We utilize multi-modal data, including physiological signals such as heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and electroencephalogram (EEG), to perform real-time emotion recognition. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has entered a new era of Large Models (LMs). With billions or trillions of parameters trained on vast amounts of corpus, LMs have achieved unprecedented successes in many challenging applications. In this paper, our approach realize the LMs-based deployment via employing a multi-scale convolutional neural network for extracting temporal and spatial features, followed by a hybrid fusion method combining early and late fusion strategies. The DEAP dataset is used to evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The ablation study further validates the importance of multi-modal features and the effectiveness of the hybrid fusion approach. The results underscore the potential of our model in enhancing the delivery and efficacy of art therapy through advanced consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "In the radio frequency field, deep neural networks have been widely used for automatic modulation recognition tasks due to their superior accuracy. However, it has been shown that these models are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are the kinds of carefully crafted perturbations that can lead to model misclassification and raise security issues in applications. To solve this problem, we propose an Ultra-Fusion Adversarial Training method, which combines adversarial training and ensemble learning to enable the model robustness to withstand different attack strengths. We explore the number and distribution of ensembled attacks and introduce a Fermi-function-like distribution to optimally balance the performance of different attack strengths. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) interval on the model accuracy and robustness, suggesting the effective SNR interval for training. Considering the demand for practical application scenarios of modulation recognition, we propose a comprehensive robustness metric based on weighted integral to evaluate the robustness of the trained models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method improves the modelâs robustness by 31.89% against white-box attacks, and achieves up to an 80.54% improvement in black-box scenarios. These results show that our method has the ability to resiliently resist potential attacks of various strengths and can be applied to spectrum application scenarios with high-security requirements.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers an effective learning architecture to protect data privacy in a distributed manner. However, the inevitable network asynchrony, overdependence on a central coordinator, and lack of an open and fair incentive mechanism collectively hinder FLâs further development. We propose IronForge, a new generation of FL framework, that features a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based structure, where nodes represent uploaded models, and referencing relationships between models form the DAG that guides the aggregation process. This design eliminates the need for central coordinators to achieve fully decentralized operations. IronForge runs in a public and open network and launches a fair incentive mechanism by enabling state consistency in the DAG. Hence, the system fits in networks where training resources are unevenly distributed. In addition, dedicated defense strategies against prevalent FL attacks on incentive fairness and data privacy are presented to ensure the security of IronForge. Experimental results based on a newly developed test bed FLSim highlight the superiority of IronForge to the existing prevalent FL frameworks under various specifications in performance, fairness, and security. To the best of our knowledge, IronForge is the first secure and fully decentralized FL (DFL) framework that can be applied in open networks with realistic network and training settings.",

        "abstract": "Security and latency are crucial aspects in the design of future wireless networks. Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community in recent years for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption, and for its latency advantage over bit-level cryptographic techniques. However, the evolution towards the fifth generation (5G) technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless communication networks. Among the potential key-enabling technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both radio frequency (RF) and optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. It is worth noting that the configuration of RIS in RF communications is different from the one in optical systems at many levels (e.g., RIS materials, signal characteristics, and functionalities). This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, machine learning (ML) is seen as a promising approach to address ...",

        "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving domain of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), ensuring robust trust management, privacy, and security presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating Generative AI (GAI) and Federated Learning (FL) to address these challenges. FL allows distributed learning across vehicles without the need to share data, enhancing privacy compared to centralized methods. Our approach enhances trust management by raising the level of accuracy in detecting anomalies and preserving data privacy. As a result, the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical real-world urban settings is illustrated by comprehensive evaluations using the CityPulse dataset. The results show a 20% improvement in trust scores under normal conditions, a 92% anomaly detection accuracy, and acceptable latency despite the added security measures. Additionally, 3D visualizations illustrate the systems robustness and scalability. This solution aligns with the objectives of 6G wireless communications, laying the groundwork for future intelligent, ultra-reliable, and secure vehicular networks. Future research will focus on expanding the application of GAI and FL for real-time decision-making in large-scale IoV networks and optimizing cryptographic protocols.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, cryptographic computation across various security applications necessitates the development of hardware that is not only fast and power-efficient but also flexible enough to support a range of cryptographic algorithms. Unfortunately, existing computing platforms for cryptography struggle to balance high flexibility, high performance, and low power consumption. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Crypto-Tailored Flexible Engine (CTFE), a next-generation coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) for cryptography. Concretely, the CTFE incorporates four innovative ideas to achieve high flexibility and performance with high hardware efficiency: processing element array (PEA) with dual-buffer lanes and multiplexer optimization, high flexibility hyper ALU, heterogeneous PEA, and bi-tiered pipeline coordination. Real-time evaluation results on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at the system-on-chip (SoC) level demonstrate that the CTFE is 1.13-14.3 times better in throughput and 55.3-14,232 times better in energy efficiency than state-of-the-art CPUs. Experiments on an ASIC 45nm CMOS technology show that the CTFE consumes the power of 1.06 W, occupies an area of 2.77 mm2, and operates at the frequency of 510 MHz. In comparison to existing CGRA solutions, CTFE outperforms 1.63-20.23 times in throughput and 1.61-73.2 times in area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Identifying Decentralized Applications (DApps) from encrypted network traffic plays an important role in areas such as network management and threat detection. However, DApps deployed on the same platform use the same encryption settings, resulting in DApps generating encrypted traffic with great similarity. In addition, existing flow-based methods only consider each flow as an isolated individual and feed it sequentially into the neural network for feature extraction, ignoring other rich information introduced between flows, and therefore the relationship between different flows is not effectively utilized. In this study, we propose a novel encrypted traffic classification model IIT to heterogeneously mine the potential features of intra-and inter-flows, which contain two types of encoders based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism. By combining the complementary intra-and inter-flow perspectives, the entire process of information flow can be more completely understood and described. IIT provides a more complete perspective on network flows, with the intra-flow perspective focusing on information transfer between different packets within a flow, and the inter-flow perspective placing more emphasis on information interaction between different flows. We captured 44 classes of DApps in the real world and evaluated the IIT model on two datasets, including DApps and malicious traffic classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the IIT model achieves a classification accuracy of greater than 97% on the real-world dataset of 44 DApps, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the IIT model exhibits good generalization in the malicious traffic classification task.",

        "abstract": "With previously unattainable performance metrics like terabit-per-second data rates, extremely low latency, and ubiquitous coverage, the next sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication technology promises to transform connectivity completely. This study highlights the major developments, difficulties, and potential uses of 6G while summarizing the state of research and development at the moment. The core technological foundations of 6G have been investigated, including terahertz (THz) frequency bands, in-band full duplex (IBFD) communication, and AI/ML-driven network optimization. Additionally, it has been implied that 6G has the ability to facilitate transformational applications such as body area networks, extended reality (XR), collaborating robotics (Cobots), smart grid 2.0, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent healthcare systems. etc. Major challenges, including ultra-dense networking, spectrum allotment, security, and privacy, are evaluated severely. The purpose of this paper is to guide future research and build a greater understanding of the revolutionary potential of 6G technology to restructure global communication networks by providing an overview of 6G research and development.",

        "abstract": "A Bitcoin miner who owns a sufficient amount of mining power can perform selfish mining to increase its relative revenue. Studies have demonstrated that the time-averaged profit of a selfish miner starts to rise once the mining difficulty level gets adjusted in favor of the attacker. Selfish mining profitability lies in the fact that orphan blocks are not incorporated into the current version of Bitcoinâs difficulty adjustment mechanism (DAM). Therefore, it is believed that considering the count of orphan blocks in the DAM can result in complete unprofitability for selfish mining. In this paper, we disprove this belief by providing a formal analysis of the selfish mining time-averaged profit. We present a precise definition of the orphan blocks that can be incorporated into calculating the next epochâs target and then introduce two modified versions of DAM in which both main-chain blocks and orphan blocks are incorporated. We propose two versions of smart intermittent selfish mining, where the first one dominates the normal intermittent selfish mining, and the second one results in selfish mining profitability under the modified DAMs. Moreover, we present the orphan exclusion attack with the help of which the attacker can stop honest miners from reporting the orphan blocks. Using combinatorial tools, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining accompanied by the orphan exclusion attack under the modified DAMs. Our results show that even when considering orphan blocks in the DAM, selfish mining can still be profitable. However, the level of profitability under the modified DAMs is significantly lower than that observed under the current version of Bitcoin DAM, suggesting that orphan reporting can be an effective countermeasure against a payoff-maximizing selfish miner.",

        "abstract": "Selfish mining, one of the most renowned attack in Bitcoin, involves a selfish miner withholding discovered blocks and broadcasting them at an opportune moment to gain higher rewards than honest mining. However, selfish mining and its variants rely on two assumptions: the attacker solely engages in infiltration mining within the victim pool (attack assumption) and the system operates in a perfect network environment (network assumption). In this paper, we propose a novel attack called Selfish in Innocent Mining (SIM). SIM expands the range of attackerâs behaviors by incorporating selfish mining into the traditional framework of innocent and infiltration mining, without increasing the attackerâs computational power. Initially, we analyze all possible states of chains in the system and their transition probabilities in the context of the SIM attack using Markov Chain. We determine the attackerâs rewards in one victim pool, multiple victim pools, and the minerâs dilemma within different cases. Subsequently, we examine the impact of an imperfect network environment on the attackerâs rewards within the SIM framework, focusing on the influence of unintentional fork rates on rewards. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that the attackerâs rewards in SIM exceed those in power-adjusting withholding (PAW) by 1.9 Ã and 2.7 Ã in different network environments, respectively. The attackerâs rewards threshold reduced to 12.38% compared to other benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "While ensemble methods can tackle concept drifts, obtaining pretrained models and conducting ensemble learning upon streamed data impose fundamental challenges, including the dynamic balance between system overhead and inference accuracy in uncertain system environments, and the interlacement between desired economic properties and long-term participation. In this paper, we propose the joint optimization which enables service providers to obtain models via repetitive auctions from the model providers and conduct ensemble methods online in a cost-efficient manner. We design polynomial-time online algorithms to solve the underlying non-linear mixed-integer social cost minimization problem, involving bid selection, payment allocation, model hosting, and ensemble model-weight adaption. We further rigorously prove the performance guarantees with our approach, such as the sub-linear dynamic regret for the bidding cost, the sub-linear dynamic fit for the long-term participation constraint, the truthfulness and the individual rationality for the auctions, the upper bound for ensemble inference loss, and the parameterized-constant competitive ratio for the long-term social cost. Through extensive trace-driven evaluations under real-world settings, we have validated the significant advantages of our approach over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Registering 3D point clouds with low overlap is challenging in 3D computer vision, primarily due to difficulties in identifying small overlap regions and removing correspondence outliers. We observe that the neighborhood similarity can be utilized to detect point correspondence, and the consistent neighborhood correspondence can be used as a criterion to detect robust overlapping regions. So that a Double-layer Multi-scale Star-graph (DMS) structure is proposed to detect robust correspondences using two different types of multi-scale star-graphs. The first-layer Multi-scale Neighbor Feature Star-graphs (MNFS) takes each point as the center and its multi-scale nearest neighbors as the leaves. The MNFS enables to establish the initial correspondence candidate set between the two point clouds based on multi-scale neighborhood topology and feature similarity. Subsequently, each pair of corresponding points find their nearest neighbors within the correspondence sets to construct a Multi-scale Matching Star-graphs (MMS) on each side, so the mutual correspondence relationships between the MMS vertices are identified. These identified mutual correspondences are treated as vertices to construct the Multi-scale Correspondence Star-graphs (MCS), that indicate the relationships among the correspondences. We design edge weight and vertex weight criterion in MCS to detect only the robust correspondence set that has strong neighborhood consistency, so as to reject the outliers. Finally, the point cloud registration is conducted based on the detected robust correspondence. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the proposed DMS method exhibits superior robustness when compared to existing state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new Signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR)-based Device selection, Power control, and Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) configuration (SDPR) algorithm, which allows imperfect aggregation of wireless federated learning (FL) in RIS-assisted Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems. The SDPR algorithm selects the local models with SINRs within an acceptable range for global aggregations, benefiting FL from involving more local models with tolerable errors. The convergence of FL under the imperfect aggregation is analytically validated, where the influence of the local model quantization and modulation is captured through the translation of the SINR thresholds to the symbol error rates (SERs). Employing successive convex approximation and gradient descent, we jointly optimize the RIS configuration and the transmit powers of participating devices, thereby minimizing the convergence upper bound of FL under imperfect aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that using SDPR, FL achieves superior convergence and accuracy by effectively utilizing model updates, even if they are received with errors. Moreover, more quantization bits do not necessarily offer better FL accuracy, and need to be tailored under specific SERs.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most popular blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts, Ethereum has caught the interest of both investors and criminals. Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to its pseudonymous nature. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp , which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. Experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset demonstrate that proposed RiskProp newly discovered 63% of the Top 150 high-risk accounts as suspicious. The superior performance of risk score-based account classification experiments further verifies the effectiveness of our rating method (85.63% accuracy).",

        "abstract": "Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. SG2 is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2âs stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand for blockchain technology in various industry sectors, there has been a growing interest in the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus that is the backbone of most of these blockchains. However, many state-of-the-art algorithms that require reliable connections can only offer limited throughput in wide-area networks (WANs), where participants are connected over long distances and may experience unpredictable network failures. The partially-connected BFTs are designed for unreliable and highly dynamic networks yet impose exponential communication complexity. This paper proposes Stable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput and low latency in WAN. SBFT separates the leader from consensus in pipelined BFT consensus and uses an adaptive consensus mechanism to resist dynamic faulty links, maintaining consensus efficiency when network connectivity is high while adapting to dynamic networks with low connectivity. We implemented a prototype of SBFT and tested it on the WAN. The results demonstrate that SBFT has a throughput similar to HotStuff in a fault-free environment but can reduce about 80% of consensus latency. Besides, SBFT retains 40% of the original throughput when the link failure probability is $0.4$ , while the baseline HotStuff retains less than 40% when the link failure probability is only $0.1$ .",

        "abstract": "Majority voting is a simple mathematical function that returns the most frequently occurring value within a given set. As a popular decision fusion technique (DFT), the majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where several independent voters report their opinions on a classification problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble learning, data crowdsourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multiclass classification problem has remained unknown. In this article, we derive a new upper bound on the accuracy of the MVF for the multiclass classification problem. More specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF exponentially decays toward 0 as the number of independent voters increases. Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of voters if these conditions are not met. We first explore the problem for voters with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) outputs, where we assume that, given the true classification of the data point, every voter follows the same conditional probability distribution of voting for different classes. Next, we extend our results to encompass independent but nonidentically distributed votes. Using the derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate only when the MVF achieves a small error rate too, and vice versa, achieve a large error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. However, in the worst case scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may exhibit a significantly higher error rate than the MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled pervasive networking and multi-modal sensing, offering various services such as remote operations and augmenting existing processes. The military setting has increasingly and notably adopted IoT technologies, such as sensor-rich drones or autonomous vehicles, which provide military personnel with enhanced situational awareness, faster decision-making capabilities, and improved operational precision. However, integrating IoT into military systems introduces new security challenges due to increased connectivity and susceptibility to vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks on military IoT systems can have severe consequences, including operational disruptions and compromises of sensitive information. This article proposes a new perspective on examining threat models in IoT-enhanced combat systems, emphasising approaches for identifying threats, conducting vulnerability assessments, and suggesting countermeasures. It delves into the characteristics and structures of IoT-enhanced combat systems, exploring technical implementations and technologies. Additionally, it outlines five significant areas of focus, including blockchain, machine learning, game theory, protocols, and algorithms, to enhance understanding of IoT-enhanced combat systems. The insights gained from this analysis can inform the development of secure and resilient military IoT systems, ultimately enhancing the safety and effectiveness of military operations.",

        "abstract": "A prominent use case of consumer electronics-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications, focused on smart cities, is connected devices that enable cities to optimize their operations via access to high volumes of sensitive data. Yet, these devices commonly utilize public channels for data access and sharing, requiring consistent communication protocols and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the aid of AI. However, most of them involve high computation and communication costs. They are not fully reliable, either. Also, AI-based IDS solutions are viewed as black boxes because they cannot justify their decisions. To resolve these issues, we have proposed a framework based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for securing consumer IoT applications in smart cities. At the beginning of the protocol execution, the participants exchange authenticated data through the blockchain-based AKA procedure. Meanwhile, we adopt the Python-based Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) framework to explain and interpret the core features guiding decision-making. The working model of this framework depicts its validation with recent benchmark methods.",

        "abstract": "The metaverse, known as the next-generation 3D Internet, represents virtual environments that mirror the physical world. It is supported by innovative technologies such as digital twins and extended reality (XR), which elevate user experiences across various fields. However, the metaverse also introduces significant cybersecurity and privacy challenges that remain underexplored. Due to its complex multi-tech infrastructure, the metaverse requires sophisticated, automated, and intelligent cybersecurity measures to mitigate emerging threats effectively. Therefore, this paper is the first to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven cybersecurity techniques for the metaverse, examining academic and industrial perspectives. First, we provide an overview of the metaverse, presenting a detailed system model, diverse use cases, and insights into its current industrial status. We then present attack models and cybersecurity threats derived from the unique characteristics and technologies of the metaverse. Next, we review AI-driven cybersecurity solutions based on three critical aspects: User authentication, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and the security of digital assets, specifically for Blockchain and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). Finally, we highlight challenges and suggest future research opportunities to enhance metaverse security, privacy, and digital asset transactions.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the profound impact of emerging technologies on the Zero Trust paradigm and the challenges they present in the evolving cybersecurity landscape. As organizations grapple with increasingly complex threats, the integration of innovative technologies with Zero Trust principles offers both promising solutions and new challenges. The research investigates how artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, quantum computing, and cloud/edge technologies are reshaping the implementation and efficacy of Zero Trust architectures. These technologies enable more sophisticated trust evaluation algorithms, enhanced threat intelligence, and dynamic access control mechanisms, thereby extending the boundaries of traditional Zero Trust models. The rapid pace of innovation introduces complexities in maintaining continuous verification and least-privilege access across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Furthermore, the integration of AI and machine learning in Zero Trust frameworks raises questions about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for explainable security decisions. The paper proposes a methodology for addressing these challenges, emphasizing the need for adaptive Zero Trust strategies that can evolve alongside technological advancements. Through examination of real-world case studies and empirical research, this study provides insights into the practical implications of emerging technologies on Zero Trust implementation. It offers guidance for enterprises on harnessing these technologies to create more resilient, responsive, and effective cybersecurity measures. This research aims to equip organizations with the knowledge and strategies necessary to embrace emerging technologies within a Zero Trust framework, enabling them to navigate the complex interplay between innovation and security in the digital age.",

        "abstract": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has ushered in a new era of efficiency across various domains, including the management of Road Traffic Congestion (RTC) in metropolitan cities. Numerous studies have elucidated how smart urban traffic management systems (TMS), encompassing 4IR technologies like Artificial Intelligent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things, and even Software-Define Networks (SDN) or Blockchain can optimize traffic flow and mitigate congestion. Given these results, there is a pressing need to evaluate these approaches and innovations in terms of their performance and sustainability. This review aims to scrutinize current technologies predicated on intelligent traffic management. It will examine the methodologies employed, the benefits derived from these systems, and potential challenges that may arise. The study has identified and categorized research based on the TMS procedure from the sensing process, traffic data evaluation, and solution developments. By providing a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art in intelligent traffic management, this review seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on leveraging 4IR technologies for sustainable urban development.",

        "abstract": "Across all periods of human history, the importance attributed to health has remained a fundamental and significant facet. This statement holds greater validity within the present context. The pressing demand for healthcare solutions with real-time capabilities, affordability, and high precision is crucial in medical research and technology progress. In recent times, there has been a significant advancement in emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, blockchain, and edge computing. These breakthrough developments have led to the creation of various intelligent applications. Smart healthcare applications can be realized by combining robust AI detection and prediction capabilities with edge computing architecture, which offers low computing costs and latency. In this paper, we begin by conducting a literature review of AI-assisted EC-based smart healthcare applications from the past three years. Our goal is to identify gaps and barriers in this field. We propose a smart healthcare architecture model that integrates AI technology into the edge. Finally, we summarize the challenges and research directions associated with the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a widely utilized consensus protocol in blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. We propose a heuristic algorithm-based accounting rights allocation method, also referred to as the witness election method, which aims to address the challenges in DPoS. The challenges associated with selected witness nodes that do not reflecting majority stakeholder preferences and susceptibility to manipulation of the vote. This method employs Kendallâs Rank Correlation as the fitness function to optimize the arrangement of the top-k producers, thereby maximizing stakeholder preferences. We propose a novel heuristic algorithm, termed SP-DEWOA, which combines the differential evolution algorithm and whale optimization with piecewise chaotic mapping to maximize permutation similarity, i.e., stakeholder preferences. To further improve the efficiency of SP-DEWOA, we parallelize SP-DEWOA based on the Spark-based parallelization design. Experimental results demonstrate that the witness nodes selected through SP-DEWOA are consistent with the preferences of the majority of stakeholders. Furthermore, SP-DEWOA has been proven to have high scalability and resilience against vote manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Aiming to boost production efficiency and reduce human workload, human-centricity has emerged as the core concept of Industry 5.0 (I5.0). However, current works have not established a unified automation and autonomous framework for human-centric smart manufacturing across various real world applications. Addressing this gap, this research introduces an innovative automated framework, ParallelWorkforce, which integrates blockchain intelligence and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) to drive the evolution from digital twins to parallel intelligence. First, this research conducts a comprehensive investigation into smart manufacturing in I5.0, summarizing the ongoing evolution. Next, a detailed exploration of ParallelWorkforce is provided to offer customized strategies for managing different levels of out-of-distribution events, significantly alleviating the workload on biological workers and maximizing the potential of both digital and robotic workers. Finally, the development of ParallelWorkforce across various key applications of smart manufacturing is demonstrated, including autonomous transportation, task assignment, and worker management. This research provides a viable solution for the further development of human-centered smart manufacturing and paves the way for the realization of â6Sâ goals in I5.0.",

        "abstract": "Smart contracts are automated programs stored on a blockchain, featuring unique attributes such as permissionlessness, trustlessness, immutability, and transparency. These properties underpin an array of unprecedented decentralized services. Compiled into bytecodes, Ethereum smart contracts are executed within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereumâs distinct gas mechanism assigns a price to each bytecode execution, incentivizing resource-efficient computing. However, a disconnect exists between conventional coding practices and the less intuitive gas consumption computation mechanism, resulting in inadvertent gas wastage. Gas-wasting code smells at the source code level have been studied in various related works; however, the task of manually identifying such code smells by reading through codes and reasoning about them is both time-consuming and economically inefficient.\nIn this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which have seen a surge in popularity recently, to facilitate undertaking the labor-intensive part of the code-smell-finding pipeline. In particular, we focus on Solidity, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Overall, we identified 26 gas-wasting code smells, out of which 13 were not presented in previous papers. On average, applying these code smells led to a reduction of approximately 10.534% in deployment costs and 21.528% in message call costs across our test codes. We further make a report on each of the identified code smells with associated example contracts sourced from either previous literature or recently deployed contracts.",

        "abstract": "The trajectory design for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) networks has become a hot research topic. In the UAV-assisted MEC scenario, the UAV is required to frequently adjust its flight trajectory due to dynamic factors such as time-varying task offloading requirements, user mobility, and transmission environment variation. In this paper, with consideration of the constraint induced by the UAV flight dynamics, the dynamic trajectory design challenge within the blockchain-based multi-UAV-assisted MEC framework is investigated. An intelligent algorithm that integrates multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and CVXPY solver, named MADDPG-LC, is proposed to achieve real-time joint optimization of dynamic trajectory control and resource allocation with respect to minimizing weighted energy consumption and delays. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MADDPG-LC algorithm in addressing the UAV flight dynamics constraint, which has generally overlooked in existing works",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), vehicular crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as an effective way in a wide range of applications, especially in intelligent transportation systems. However, centralized VCS frameworks have confronted many problems, such as privacy, security, utility, and dependability. To remedy these challenges, blockchain technology can be applied in VCS systems for effectively forming decentralized autonomous vehicles organizations and operations. This article briefly introduces blockchain-based VCS solutions addressing the current problems and presents potential directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "As part of TIV's DHW on Vehicle 5.0, this letter introduces a novel concept, Logistics 5.0, to address high complexities in logistics Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). Building upon the theory of parallel intelligence and leveraging advanced technologies and methods such as blockchain, scenarios engineering, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAOs), Logistics 5.0 promises to accelerate the paradigm shift towards intelligent and sustainable logistics. First, the parallel logistics framework is proposed, and the logistics ecosystem is discussed. Then, the human-oriented operating systems (HOOS) are suggested to providing intelligent Logistics 5.0 solutions. Logistics 5.0 serves as a critical catalyst in realizing the â6Sâ objectives, i.e. Safety, Security, Sustainability, Sensitivity, Service, and Smartness, within the logistics industry.",
