        "abstract": "Distributed DevOps is a software development methodology that aims to integrate the work of development and operations teams without being bound by geographical constraints. This methodology excels in enhancing collaboration and the speed of software development. However, it does suffer from a lack of security, transparency, and traceability, which can result in project delays, a lack of trust between stakeholders, and even project failure. This paper addresses these issues of Distributed DevOps by implementing Blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages blockchain technology to address the challenges faced by Distributed DevOps. Through performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a real-world scenario, highlighting its ability to improve transparency, traceability, and the security of the DevOps pipeline. Our findings underscore the potential of blockchain-empowered solutions in revolutionizing DevOps practices. Furthermore, this research offers a practical framework for organizations seeking to optimize their development processes by integrating blockchain technology.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms have been reshaping the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) landscape. These transformations not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and productivity of SDLC tasks but also influence the roles and existence of software personas within the SDLC ecosystem. This study evaluates GenAI's effects on the roles of software personas engaged in the typical SDLC phases: planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. When evaluating these effects, it becomes evident that GenAI's impact varies across roles and their relation to specific SDLC phases and activities. While some roles experience a substantial impact, achieving full AI-driven automation remains a challenge for roles that demand critical thinking, empathy, and other human supervision. Overall, GenAI's penetration will necessitate new skills and a redefinition of roles for many tasks within SDLC, where humans and AI will collaborate to create better, faster, and more efficient software.",

        "abstract": "Recently, 6G has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. 6G networks are expected to exhibit even more heterogeneity than 5G networks, and support various emerging scenarios and applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), air/space/ground networks, and Internet of Things. Such massive heterogeneous devices pose huge challenges for network control and management. Recently, advances in artificial intelligence have brought to a new clan of networks, termed as self-driving 6G networks. It utilizes network telemetry, artificial intelligence, and DevOps to simplify networks and operations, helping network owners improve network quality, as well as increase efficiency. However, the current network is built on closed merchant switching ASICs and a homegrown management and control system. Self-driving an opaque system without really knowing and controlling what they do is a hazardous and fruitless endeavor. Fortunately, the network programmability technology opens the possibility for running self-driving algorithms over the whole network. In this paper, we design a full-dimensional programmability empowered self-driving 6G network architecture. We discuss how network programmability can promote the release of network intelligence, from the view of both verticality (control and data plane) and horizontality (end to end). Moreover, three use cases are designed to demonstrate that the proposed architecture can automatically cope with the dynamically changing complex network environment, realize automatic perception and automatic decision, and then facilitate the automation level of the network and enhance the performance of the network.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of Monza , a testchip SoC featuring Efficient Computer Companyâs Fabric processor. The Fabric is a general-purpose, spatial-dataflow architecture and compiler designed to minimize energy. The Fabric offers a unique combination of familiar software DevOps and extreme efficiency. Monza includes a small Fabric, a RISCV core, 1MB SRAM, digital I/O, and integrated clock generation and power conversion. Monza is implemented in 22nm FD-SOI process and was taped out in Q4â23. Signoff timing and power simulations estimate up to 550 GOPS/W @ 310 Î¼W on a dense convolution kernel written in C.",
