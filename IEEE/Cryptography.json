        "abstract": "Identifying Decentralized Applications (DApps) from encrypted network traffic plays an important role in areas such as network management and threat detection. However, DApps deployed on the same platform use the same encryption settings, resulting in DApps generating encrypted traffic with great similarity. In addition, existing flow-based methods only consider each flow as an isolated individual and feed it sequentially into the neural network for feature extraction, ignoring other rich information introduced between flows, and therefore the relationship between different flows is not effectively utilized. In this study, we propose a novel encrypted traffic classification model IIT to heterogeneously mine the potential features of intra-and inter-flows, which contain two types of encoders based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism. By combining the complementary intra-and inter-flow perspectives, the entire process of information flow can be more completely understood and described. IIT provides a more complete perspective on network flows, with the intra-flow perspective focusing on information transfer between different packets within a flow, and the inter-flow perspective placing more emphasis on information interaction between different flows. We captured 44 classes of DApps in the real world and evaluated the IIT model on two datasets, including DApps and malicious traffic classification tasks. The results demonstrate that the IIT model achieves a classification accuracy of greater than 97% on the real-world dataset of 44 DApps, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the IIT model exhibits good generalization in the malicious traffic classification task.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing increases the security risks of data in intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) based on traditional cryptography. Multivariate Public Key Cryptography has the security advantage of resisting quantum computing and Rainbow is an important research focus in it. However, the Rainbow algorithms secret keys are too large to suitable for resource-constrained IoT system. We propose an efficient Rainbow signature scheme based on circulant and Toeplitz matrices for intelligent IoT. In our scheme, the variable matrixes of polynomials have special forms constructed from circulant and Toeplitz matrices. Every variable matrix of central maps and public key polynomials is divided into four submatrices. Three submatrices of variable matrixes are generated using seeds randomly chosen. The fourth submatrix is generated by an affine map and three submatrices. Therefore, the public key consists of seeds and variables in the fourth submatrices, rather than all variables of polynomials. Then, the correctness of our scheme has been proved and we provide a security analysis. More specifically, itâs proved that the scheme can resist five attacks against Rainbow, such as Direct attacks, Unbalanced oil vinegar attacks, MinRank attacks, HighRank attacks, and Rainbow-band-separation attacks. At last, according to the experimental results, our systemâs public key sizes are 97.96% smaller and private key size are 92.12% than the key sizes of the standard Rainbow scheme. Additionally, compare with other Rainbow-like schemes, the comparison analysis and experimental results show that our scheme has less communication costs and small key size than those in the similar literatures for IoT.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) marks a significant milestone in technological advancement, impacting various sectors and transforming the essence of public and personal activities. Traditional machine learning, known as centralized learning, involves collecting data from multiple sources for model development, which poses significant privacy risks. To address the conflict between the need for data sharing and the protection of privacy, federated learning has emerged as a promising solution. This approach allows for the continuous sharing of model updates between a central server and numerous local devices, fostering collaborative model development. However, it also brings about considerable communication costs and raises privacy concerns due to the potential for sensitive information leakage from the central server and local devices. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and accuracy-lossless privacy-preserving federated learning scheme based on gradient clipping. The central server introduces noise to the global model to prevent clients from extracting valuable information, and then the local devices train these models using their data. To reduce the communication load, parameters with less impact on the model are removed using the Fisher information matrix. Additionally, to enhance privacy protection, the client-computed parameters are perturbed using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method. Our experiments show that this approach greatly reduces the communication load for clients and the server, while effectively safeguarding client privacy and maintaining the modelâs accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Matchmaking encryption constructed in the identity-based encryption setting, named identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME), requires both sender and receiver to specify target identity simultaneously for each other for message decryption. The IB-ME schemes can not only ensures the privacy of the sender and the message but also provides authentication for the data source. In order to resist quantum-attacks, we put forward a post-quantum secure IB-ME scheme. Compared with Ateniese et al.'s scheme and Francati et al.'s scheme, our approach eliminates the use of functional encryption, predicate encryption and signature scheme, and only uses a more simple preimage sampling function and an IBE scheme in the way of non-black-box. Compared with post-quantum secure IB-MEs proposed currently, our scheme is the first non-black-box construction based on standard lattice assumptions such as LWE and ISIS assumptions.",

        "abstract": "Cryptography is the core of information security. Among various types of ciphers, the traditional Hill Cipher (THC) is a static alternative cipher based on the basic matrix theory. Stuck in the security and real-time issues of the THC with time-invariant key, this paper studies a dynamic novel Hill Cipher (NHC) with time-variant key for the first time. To ensure the fast decryption of the NHC, this work chooses the zeroing neural network (ZNN) which plays vital important role in solving dynamic problems as the decryption algorithm of NHC to solve the time-variant key inversion (TVKI) matrix. Specifically, a new robust fixed-time convergent activation function (NRFT-AF) and a new time-variant convergence factor (NTv-CF) are designed, and thus a new-type zeroing neural network model (NT-ZNN) is constructed by them for solving the TVKI. By virtue of abundant rigorous mathematical derivation, the fixed-time convergence and robustness of NT-ZNN model for solving the TVKI under the cases without noise and with noise are theoretically demonstrated in detail. Moreover, the NHC is also applied to the encryption and decryption experiments of different strings and RGB color image to validate its reliability. Then, comparative simulation results of the NT-ZNN model with conventional-type zeroing neural network (CT-ZNN) models constructed by other existing activation functions (AFs) and convergence factors (CFs) for solving the TVKI are given, and the superiority of the NT-ZNN model in NHC decryption is further verified.",

        "abstract": "In advanced metering infrastructure, the bidirectional communication over insecure public channels between smart meters and the data concentrator is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack. Existing schemes often exhibit insecurities or inefficiencies, necessitating an efficient and secure authentication scheme for advanced metering infrastructure. To address these challenges, this proposal presents an energy-efficient and secured behavioral biometrics based certificateless authentication and key agreement protocol using elliptic curve cryptography. The protocol includes encrypted registration, behavioral biometrics-based identity validation, identity binding through behavioral biometrics and implicit authentication of entitiesâ public key to mitigate man-in-the-middle attack and its variants. The proposed protocol for real-time advanced metering infrastructure testbed is implemented using Python and security is analyzed through Pro-Verif tool. The performance evaluation confirms that the proposed scheme meets security requirements while minimizing computation and communication costs in terms of energy, thereby showcasing its superiority among counterparts and its suitability for resource-constrained smart grid environments.",

        "abstract": "A 256-bit high-performance hardware accelerator for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in GF(p) over Generic Weierstrass Curves is presented in this paper. Firstly, to improve the utilization of the multiplier, a new radix-128 Montgomery modular multiplication (MMM) without final reduction is proposed. Secondly, a combined-addition (CA) is proposed to recover the final reduction of MMM. The CA could reduce the clock cycles of continuous MMM. Finally, a high-parallelism Montgomery ladder hardware accelerator is presented to improve the performance of the elliptic curve point-multiplication (ECPM). The proposed accelerator consumes 766k gates and compute the 256-bit ECPM in 0.014 ms on ASIC with a 90 nm standard cell library. This is a higher performance design compared to previous research in GF(p) over Generic Weierstrass Curves.",

        "abstract": "The centralized data sharing challenges in healthcare have spurred the adoption of distributed methods, including blockchain technology, to enhance security and privacy. This paper proposes a blockchain-based healthcare system leveraging post-quantum cryptography to secure sensitive patient data, stored on a permissioned blockchain. Discrete event simulation (DES) is used in the simulation to represent and assess three critical processes: blockchain transactions, patient data requests, and data encryption. We examine the dynamics of blockchain transaction processing, encryption effectiveness, and data access inside the suggested architecture through simulation. The results highlight how post-quantum encryption and blockchain technology can strengthen healthcare data management by resolving important concerns about patient data sharingâs integrity and confidentiality.",

        "abstract": "Metaverse allows users to immersively interact with millions of partners, breaking through the constraints of the physical world. To ensure the traceability of malicious avatars, provers in large-scale commercial activities need to periodically submit identity parameters to the verifier as interaction evidence, imposing a disastrous communication and storage burden on both parties. In this paper, we propose a traceable and efficient continuous authentication scheme for large-scale avatars. First, we construct a continuous authentication framework, where the proverâs device locally checks its manipulator to submit the starting and ending identities as interaction evidence. Second, we propose a transitive signature scheme with path verifiability to ensure the relevance and unforgeability of the starting and ending identities. Finally, we design a traceable authentication protocol based on the proposed signature scheme to reduce communication and storage costs while guaranteeing traceability. Security analysis shows that the protocol not only defends against the attacks of device hijacking and false accusations but also supports virtual-to-physical tracking. Extensive evaluations show that the communication cost and storage costs are reduced by 95.97% and 98.35%, respectively, which can be used for avatar authentication and tracking in large-scale commercial activities.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing is an emerging technology on the verge of reshaping industries, while simultaneously challenging existing cryptographic algorithms. FALCON, a recent standard quantum-resistant digital signature, presents a challenging hardware implementation due to its extensive non-integer polynomial operations, necessitating FFT over the ring Q[x]/(x n+1). This paper introduces an ultra-low-power and compact processor tailored for FFT/IFFT operations over the ring for efficient FALCON implementation. The proposed processor incorporates various optimization techniques, including twiddle factor compression and conflict-free scheduling. In an ASIC implementation using a 22 nm GF process, the proposed processor demonstrates an area occupancy of 0.15 mm2 and a power consumption of 12.6 mW/28.1 mW at an operating frequency of 167 MHz/500 MHz for the non-pipelined/pipelined version of the processor. Since a hardware implementation of FFT/IFFT over the ring is currently non-existent, the execution time achieved by this processor is compared to the reference software implementation of FFT/IFFT of FALCON on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Cortex-A72, where the proposed pipelined processor achieves a speedup up to 3.8Ã. Furthermore, in comparison to dedicated state-of-the-art hardware accelerators for classic FFT, the pipelined architecture occupies 42% less area and consumes 64% less power, on average. The quantified speedup in the context of FALCON suggests that the proposed hardware design offers a promising solution for the efficient implementation of FALCON.",

        "abstract": "In the contemporary era, the global proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exceeds 15 billion, serving functions from wearables to smart grid monitoring. These devices frequently manage sensitive data, underscoring the need for secure and reliable IoT networks leveraging blockchain technology. A key innovation of this study is an approach to mitigate vulnerabilities that quantum computing poses to blockchain-based IoT systems, which existing cryptographic methods cannot effectively address. Quantum computers could exploit these weaknesses to compromise key-pair generation and extract private keys from transaction signatures. To overcome this, the research introduces an optimized implementation of the post-quantum digital signature algorithm Dilithium-5, ensuring blockchain security and quantum readiness. These transaction signatures are designed for low-power, cost-effective microcontrollers, such as the ESP32, making the solution accessible for a wide range of IoT devices. In addition, the study includes a case study involving a post-quantum safe portable device for measuring blood oxygen levels and heart rate, illustrating the practical benefits and effectiveness of the proposed solution in enhancing IoT security against quantum threats. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures quantum-resistant security while maintaining performance efficiency, making it suitable for real-world IoT applications.",

        "abstract": "Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) is one of the most prevalent cryptographic primitives for realizing privacy and fine-grained access control in cloud computing. However, most of the existing CP-ABE schemes constructed using Paring-Based Cryptography (PBC) from Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) or Diffie Hellman Problem (DHP) assumptions are susceptible to quantum attacks, whereas CP-ABE schemes constructed using lattice-based cryptography based on Learning with Errors (LWE) and Ring-LWE (R-LWE) assumptions are quantum-safe and ensure fine-grained access control. This paper comprehensively surveys the existing Lattice-based CP-ABE (LCP-ABE) schemes based on LWE and R-LWE assumptions. Further, this paper analyzes and compares the security and performance features of existing LCP-ABE schemes. Finally, this paper identifies the open issues and future directions that need further investigation on LCP-ABE schemes.",

        "abstract": "Many cryptographic applications require a vast number of modular multiplications with a large prime modulus. Generalized Mersennes are a class of primes commonly used in cryptography because of their special forms. When modulus is a generalized Mersenne prime, modular reductions can be calculated efficiently by several additions and subtractions thanks to their special forms. This work modifies the classical reduction algorithms for generalized Mersenne primes in the literature such that the additions and subtractions in these algorithms are performed in parallel from lower digits to higher digits, and the resulting carries and borrows are propagated together. Because calculated values can be negative, twoâs complement arithmetic is used in calculations. The proposed algorithms have substantial speed improvements over the classical algorithms in software. Also, because reduction modulo an n bit special prime p is performed by a series of n -bit additions and subtractions, a small Î´ bit overflow may occur in the result such that Î´ âª n . Thus, a final reduction is needed after main reduction. In this work, we prove that the final reduction can be achieved by at most two subtractions where the modulus p â¥ 2 n /(1+2 âÎ´+1 ). And, we show that this lower bound is satisfied by the special primes commonly used in cryptography including the generalized Mersenne primes in practical applications. The proposed modular reduction algorithms handle the final reduction by two subtractions in constant time to avoid timing attacks.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, cryptographic computation across various security applications necessitates the development of hardware that is not only fast and power-efficient but also flexible enough to support a range of cryptographic algorithms. Unfortunately, existing computing platforms for cryptography struggle to balance high flexibility, high performance, and low power consumption. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Crypto-Tailored Flexible Engine (CTFE), a next-generation coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) for cryptography. Concretely, the CTFE incorporates four innovative ideas to achieve high flexibility and performance with high hardware efficiency: processing element array (PEA) with dual-buffer lanes and multiplexer optimization, high flexibility hyper ALU, heterogeneous PEA, and bi-tiered pipeline coordination. Real-time evaluation results on Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA at the system-on-chip (SoC) level demonstrate that the CTFE is 1.13-14.3 times better in throughput and 55.3-14,232 times better in energy efficiency than state-of-the-art CPUs. Experiments on an ASIC 45nm CMOS technology show that the CTFE consumes the power of 1.06 W, occupies an area of 2.77 mm2, and operates at the frequency of 510 MHz. In comparison to existing CGRA solutions, CTFE outperforms 1.63-20.23 times in throughput and 1.61-73.2 times in area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "With continuous development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), intelligence is gradually becoming the mainstream trend of future transportation. However, the increasing number of vehicles and their high mobility also bring greater challenges to privacy and security. Most of the current authentication schemes in IoV focus on a single domain, ignoring the cross-domain requirements brought by high mobility. To address these issues better, we propose an efficient anonymous cross-domain authentication scheme EACAS based on elliptic curve cryptography within the certificate-less cryptography. We incorporate the secret sharing with digital signature to provide the trustworthy authentication for cross-domain vehicles, and the batch verification improves the efficiency of authentication. Besides, we also propose a hierarchical pseudonym method for multi-domain scenarios, allowing vehicles to update pseudonyms at arbitrary locations and can be revealed. The formal security proof and analysis demonstrate the security characteristics, and the comprehensive performance evaluation shows the efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Polynomial multiplication is a significant bottleneck in mainstream postquantum cryptography (PQC) schemes. To speed it up, number theoretic transform (NTT) is widely used, which decreases the time complexity from ${O}(n^{2})$ to $O[n\\log_{2}(n)]$ . However, it is challenging to ensure optimal hardware efficiency in conjunction with scalability. This brief proposes a novel pipelined NTT/inverse-NTT (INTT) architecture on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). A group-based pairwise memory access (GPMA) scheme is proposed, and a scratchpad and reordering unit (SRU) is designed to form an efficient dataflow that simplifies control units and achieves almost $n/2$ processing cycles on average for $n$ -point NTT. Moreover, our architecture can support varying parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, our architecture achieves up to 4.8 $\times$ latency improvements and up to 4.3 $\times$ improvements on area time product (ATP).",

        "abstract": "The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is a central primitive to compute polynomial multiplication in a finite ring for both post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. This brief presents a novel, efficient NTT hardware architecture suitable for CRYSTALS-Kyber, one of the NIST PQC standards. It is based on a new novel unified butterfly unit (UBU) developed by combining interleaved multiplication, radix-4, and resource-sharing strategies. This unit computes all butterfly operations for any generic prime modulus value and is re-configurable to any modulus length. In the proposed NTT architecture, multiple UBUs are deployed, demonstrating an area-time tradeoff. UBU and NTT architectures are synthesized and implemented over the Xilinix Artix-7 FPGA platform and results are shown for different performance evaluation metrics. The implementation results show our lightweight and high-speed designs achieve up to 5.6Ã and 7Ã improvements in resource consumption and efficiency, respectively. To the authorsâ knowledge, it is the first generic NTT architecture based on interleaved multiplication approaches.",

        "abstract": "Efficient binary polynomial multiplication (BPM) implementations are crucial for the practical deployment of bit flipping key encapsulation (BIKE) postquantum cryptography (PQC) due to its computation-intensive nature. To speed up BPM, this brief proposes a scalable and efficient architecture. The proposed architecture employs a novel blockwise sparsity algorithm, which segments sparse polynomials into blocks and leverages interblock and inner block sparsity to eliminate invalid computations, thereby significantly reducing computational operations. Moreover, a scalable block-by-block pipeline structure, along with a multibank random access memory (RAM) for sparse polynomials, is designed to effectively process blocks, resulting in substantial enhancement in performance. Experimental results on Xilinx Artix-7 Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) demonstrate significant performance superiority on the proposed architecture, compared with existing approaches. Across different bandwidth settings of 16, 32, 64, or 128, our design can achieve 4.5 $\times$ $\\sim$ 35.1 $\times$ , 4.9 $\times$ $\\sim$ 78.8 $\times$ , 2.5 $\times$ $\\sim$ 112.7 $\times$ , and 0.5 $\times$ $\\sim$ 164.2 $\times$ speedup, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art works, our design achieves 2.8 $\times$ $\\sim$ 152.0 $\times$ improvements in area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The number of IoT devices has grown significantly in recent years, and edge computing in IoT is considered a new and growing trend in the technology industry. While cryptography is widely used to enhance the security of IoT devices, it also carries limitations such as resource constraints or latency. Therefore, lightweight cryptography (LWC) balances commensurate resource usage and maintaining security while minimizing system costs. The ASCON stands out among the LWC algorithms as a potential target for implementation and cryptoanalysis. It provides authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and hashing functionalities in many variants, aiming for various applications. In this brief, we present an implementation of Ascon cryptography as a peripheral of a RISC-V System-on-a-Chip (SoC). The ASCON crypto core occupies 1,424 LUTs in FPGA and 17.4 kGE in 180nm CMOS technology while achieving 417 Gbits/J energy efficiency at a supply voltage of 1.0V and frequency of 2 MHz.",

        "abstract": "Although it is widely deemed impossible to overcome the information theoretic optimality of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher in pre-and post-quantum cryptography, this work shows that the optimality of information theoretic security (ITS) of OTP is paradoxical from the perspective of information conservational computing and cryptography. To prove this point, ITS of OTP is extended to information conservational security (ICS) of scalable OTP (S-OTP) with percentage-based key extension where total key length can be reduced to a condensed tiny minimum through âblack holeâ keypad compression coupled with âbig bangâ data recov-ery. The cost is a limited 25%+ increase in total data length and network traffic; the gain is to makes the transmission of long messages possible without weakening ITS/OTP. It is proven that if ITS/OTP were optimal, ICS/S-OTP would be impossible; on the other hand, if ICS/S-OTP were not information theoretically secure, ITS/OTP would not be secure either. Thus, we have a proof by contradiction on the paradoxical nature of OTP optimality. It is further proven that a summation with percentage distribution is a special case of equilibrium-based bipolar quantum cellular automata. This proof bridges a classical world with a quantum world and makes it possible to combine the advantages of both approaches for pre-and post-quantum cryptography. It is suggested that the findings of this work form an analytical paradigm of quantum intelligence machinery toward perfect information conservational security. Some mysteries in nature and science are identified. In particular, the question is posted: Could modern science have been like a well-founded building with a floor of observable beings and truths but missing its roof for equilibrium, harmony, information conservation, and logically definable causality?.",

However, the independent use of each technology in the power-limited satellite systems results in a trade-off problem between onboard power consumption and security performance due to additional encryption costs and dependence of PLS on the performance of eavesdroppers (Eves). In this paper, we integrate the PLS and cryptography considering the complementary properties of the adaptability to wireless channel characteristics and inherent message confidentiality for secure multibeam satellite networks. To this end, we estimate the eavesdropping risk as a function of the given number of Eves for independent and collaborative attacks. Moreover, we design an onboard power model utilized for transmission and computation, and Gaussian beamforming based on the eavesdropping risk. Then, we derive solutions for onboard power allocation, beam scheduling, and security algorithm selection in the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the secure transmission performance improves even under the increment of the eavesdropping risk, and the trade-off performance between cryptography and PLS is provided through analytical and simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things based healthcare system (IoMTHS) is a kind of industrial information system that integrates life monitoring, pathological inference and drug therapy. However, the sensitive nature and high value of its data make it a prime target for cyberattacks. Although many multi-server authentication protocols have been studied in recent years to ensure that only authorized users can access medical services, new vulnerabilities are always identified and covertly utilized by the smarter adversary due to lack of continuous monitoring and dynamic authentication, reducing the trustworthiness of IoMTHS. To address above challenges, in this paper, we propose a multi-server authentication scheme with integrated monitoring (MAIM) for IoMTHS, which achieves user locked access control by strictly and continuously binding system access permissions and user behavior. MAIM consists of a three-factor based static authentication (TFSA) and a deep learning-based continuous authentication (DLCA). TFSA utilizes Double-Anonymity Strategy to protect usersâ privacy and track their malicious behaviors, and uses Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to protect the security of privacy information in usersâ devices and servers, which achieves lightweight and three-factor secrecy. The DLCA trains a deep neural network to recognize the legitimacy of users based on the user behavior transmitted by their sensing devices. TFSA is provably secure under the random oracle model, whereas DLCA exhibits high feasibility with experimental accuracy reaching 100%.",

        "abstract": "The field of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is continuously evolving. Many researchers are exploring efficient PQC implementation on various platforms, including x86, ARM, FPGA, GPU, etc. In this paper, we present an Efficient CryptOgraphy CRYSTALS (ECO-CRYSTALS) implementation on standard 64-bit RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The target schemes are two winners of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC competition: CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, where the two most time-consuming operations are Keccak and polynomial multiplication. Notably, this paper is the first highly-optimized assembly software implementation to deploy Kyber and Dilithium on the 64-bit RISC-V ISA. Firstly, we propose a better scheduling strategy for Keccak, which is specifically tailored for the 64-bit dual-issue RISC-V architecture. Our 24-round Keccak permutation (Keccak- p [1600,24]) achieves a 59.18% speed-up compared to the reference implementation. Secondly, we apply two modular arithmetic (Montgomery arithmetic and Plantard arithmetic) in the polynomial multiplication of Kyber and Dilithium to get a better lazy reduction. Then, we propose a flexible dual-instruction- issue scheme of Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). As for the matrix-vector multiplication, we introduce a row-to- column processing methodology to minimize the expensive memory access operations. Compared to the reference implementation, we obtain a speedup of 53.85%~85.57% for NTT, matrix-vector multiplication, and INTT in our ECO-CRYSTALS. Finally, the ECO-CRYSTALS implementation for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation in Kyber achieves 399k, 448k, and 479k cycles respectively, achieving speedups of 60.82%, 63.93%, and 65.56% compared to the NIST reference implementation. Similarly, the ECO-CRYSTALS implementation for key generation, sign, and verify in Dilithium reaches 1 364k, 3 191k, and 1 369k cycles, showcasing speedups of 54.84%, 64.98%, and 57.20%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Despite development of numerous cryptographic algorithms over the last decade to ensure greater security for the users, the cyberattack forms are still advancing what creates a challenge for research community to build more efficient infrastructure. It motivates us to design a more advanced algorithms based on a set of matrices that form a group under matrix multiplication, meaning they satisfy the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. Specifically, this study explores the application of three cryptographic algorithms on special linear group of matrices over a ring of integers modulo m. The first algorithm relies on the RSA key exchange algorithm, which we modify to a special linear group. The second, is an asymmetric RSA variant of cryptographic algorithm defined on the coadjoint orbit of element K belonging to a special linear group. All matrices from the orbit of matrix K have the same order and can be easily encrypted and decrypted by a pair of secret asymmetric cryptographic keys. We apply the Kronecker product of non-Abelian groups to construct an energy efficient cryptographic algorithm with possible application on sensor networks. Due to the multiplicative property of Kronecker product both the encryption and decryption can be performed in parallel over the matrices of low degree. The third one is another RSA variant of symmetric cryptographic algorithm, which can be encoded with a special linear group, what significantly increases its complexity at the stage of non-negative matrix factorization. To encrypt a given set of numbers we write it in a matrix form with secret sequence of generators. As a result, the decryption relies on solving a simple system of nonlinear equations. Security of the algorithm lies in complexity aimed to build a correct sequence of generators necessary for encryption.",

        "abstract": "Visual cryptography (VC) schemes provide a distinguished image encryption technique to protect image security since it can visually decrypt the secret image by superimposing the encrypted shadows. VC schemes for both threshold access structures and general access structures are generally constructed based on the OR operation to minimize the pixel expansion. However, VC schemes with optimal pixel expansion typically have low contrast. Stacking operation OR frequently produces recovered images with poor visual quality and are never able to deliver flawless recovery for secret images. Therefore, we studied XOR-based VC (XVC) schemes that employ linear programming to maximize their contrast. Three schemes for general access structures and three schemes for threshold access structures are designed to maximize their contrast. The proposed schemesâ construction is reduced to a linear programming to maximize the contrast by determining the ideal combinations of basis matrices in terms of primary column matrices and unit matrices, respectively. The comparison study and experimental results demonstrate that the contrast of the previous VC and XVC schemes can be further improved.",

        "abstract": "Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has recently gained intensive attention as the existing public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable to quantum attacks. The ring-learning-with-errors (RLWE)-based PQC is one promising type of the lattice-based schemes. A light variant, called binary RLWE (BRLWE), was developed with applications to Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge computing. However, deploying the number theoretic transform (NTT) is not beneficial to the parameter settings of the BRLWE-based scheme. This paper presents three high-speed architectures of decryption for the BRLWE-based scheme with low area-time complexity. The first one is modified and corrected from the low-latency design of the previous work. The second and third ones utilize the multiplexer-based design for multiplication and innovatively exploit the property of the skew-circulant matrix to reduce the computational latency. Moreover, the third one applies the Karatsuba algorithm to reduce the number of multiplications. However, the results demonstrate that it is not in favor of the design since the multiplication is involved in an integer and a binary number, not both integers. Let the lengths of the secret and public keys be n\nand n\\log _{2}q\nbits. The synthesized results reveal that the second and third architectures are superior to the lookup table (LUT)-based and linear- feedback shift register (LFSR)-based designs in the previous works in terms of area-time complexity. The FPGA implementation results indicate the second design outperforms the Karatsuba and Toeplitz matrix vector product (TMVP)-initiated accelerators in the literatures by reductions of 62.4% and 51.7% in area-time complexity for the case of (n, q) = (256, 256)\n. As (n,q)=(512,256)\n, the improvements are 44.3% and 28.3%. The third architecture is also superior to these high-speed designs. The proposed implementations are efficient in area-time complexity and are suitable for high-performance applications.",

It is interesting to find functions with few Walsh-Hadamard transform values (spectral amplitudes) and to determine their distributions. In this letter, a new modified generalized Maiorana-McFarland (MGMM) construction is presented. A collection of MGMM classes of functions of few spectral amplitudes can be obtained by using the proposed construction. The constructed functions have determined spectral amplitude distributions. As a class of these MGMM functions, generalized 3-ary functions of two nonzero spectral amplitudes $3^{n/2}$ and $3^{n/2+1}$ are then exploited to construct spreading sequences for even $n$. Moreover, an efficient assignment is presented to provide that the smallest distance between pairs of sequences of correlation $3^{n/2+1}$ is 3, which implies that the spreading sequences based on these functions in our assignment have better interference-resist capability than the spreading sequences based on ternary semi-bent functions.",

        "abstract": "Profiled side-channel analysis presents a significant risk to embedded devices in Internet of Things (IoT). Typically, a single trace is insufficient to successfully key recovery in practical scenarios. It still requires several traces based on Bayesâ posterior probability. In this paper, we introduce a chosen-plaintext strategy into the deep learning-based profiled attacks to improve the attack efficiency. Firstly, we present a general strategy to profile the leakage model by exploiting the sensitivity analysis and clustering analysis. The leakage model derived from Deep Neural Network is to characterize the leakage of the target algorithm. Secondly, we propose an adaptive chosen-plaintext method in the deep learning-based attack, transforming the conditional probability distribution of the leakage into the entropy of the key candidates under the profiled leakage model. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the attack by practical measurements. The results demonstrate that the proposed method requires fewer traces to retrieve the key of AES on devices of different types, e.g., Smartcard, FPGA, and ARM. Moreover, our attack improves the attack efficiency on masked implementations.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are essential technologies to ensure safe road traffic management and enhance driving convenience. Nowadays, diversified authentication schemes have been developed in VANETs for the purpose of safer communication between nodes. For instance, biometric technology which employs biometric information as usersâ authentic identity is widely adopted in message authentication due to its visible benefits. Nonetheless, there is a significant problem in current biometric identity-based authentication schemes that noise is inevitable in each collection of biometric information, making these schemes lack critical error tolerance. Additionally, anonymous biometric identity is difficult to be realized, which fails to meet the basic standard of VANETs. For solving the above key issues, we propose the first efficient fuzzy certificateless signature-based (FCLS) authentication scheme using anonymous biometric identities for VANETs. In virtue of its superior error tolerance, it enables authentication between two identities represented by two attribute sets within a certain Hamming distance. Besides, the newly developed authentication scheme realizes effective conditional privacy so that driversâ real biometric identities can be ensured. Through the formal security proof, this FCLS scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attack (EU-CMA) in the random oracle model (ROM), which reaches the higher security. Compared with current advanced schemes, the new authentication scheme is more efficient in computation and communication according to performance analysis.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, SGX-style integrity trees (SITs) have been applied in trusted execution environments (TEEs) to protect the off-chip memory security from physical attacks, replay attacks, etc. As a trade-off, SIT implementations incur a huge performance overhead due to its extra computations and memory accesses. Recent works reduced the memory accesses and significantly increased the speed, but the performance overhead is still high. To tackle this challenge, this paper performs an insight analysis under current SIT implementations, then identifies two critical remaining performance overhead causes: hash and decryption computations. Next, a novel design named PreSIT based on a proposed parallel operation flow is introduced. It performs prefetching and precomputes partial results of hash and decryption processes. By designing the prediction algorithm flow and predict-assisted algorithms, along with the proposed dedicated prediction data structure to effectively store and access the precomputed results, the performance overhead is further reduced. According to the evaluations of GEM5 on SPEC 2017, GAP, PARSEC, and SPLASH2x, PreSIT improves the average instruction per cycle (IPC) by 5.1% (at most 21.6%) based on the SIT in VAULT without any security degradation.",

        "abstract": "Modular addition is a fundamental operation in public-key cryptographic algorithms operating in finite fields, such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Chebyshev polynomials and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The performance of these cryptographic algorithms is limited by the conventional modular adder approach, which incorporates two cascaded adders in series. This approach leads to a doubled critical path delay, ultimately causing a decrease in frequency despite utilizing a high-performance adder.This research presents a high-performance, low-area architecture for a modular adder, employing a novel approach.Specifically designed for various prime fields recommended in public key cryptography, the architecture optimally utilizes the carry chain and exploits the structural advantages of the 7-series FPGA and series beyond. Implementation results demonstrate superior performance, achieving operating frequencies of 290.0 MHz for 192 bits and 205.5 MHz for 1024 bits.Notably, the proposed design performs modular addition in a single clock cycle, resulting in an approximate 57% frequency enhancement compared to the conventional approach. Consequently, this architecture stands as an optimal solution for systems demanding high-speed operations.",

Most of the existing secure time synchronization protocols incur high communication and storage costs, and are subject to a few known security attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel secure time synchronization protocol for both homogeneous and heterogeneous WSN models; the protocol uses pairing-based cryptography to secure the time synchronization and to reduce the communication and storage requirements of each node. Security analysis of the protocol shows that it is highly robust against different attacks, namely selective forwarding attack, wormhole attack, masquerade attack, message manipulation attack, replay attack and delay attack.",

However, current mainstream designs ignore the impact of computing array size, resulting in poor design flexibility and low memory utilization. To address these issues, we propose, a memory-efficient tri-stage PM accelerator. Our proposed tri-stage PM algorithm fuses all isolated substages into a unique stage named fused coefficient-wise multiplication (FCWM), ensuring efficient computation. Meanwhile, in different stages of the algorithm, the circuit of two-dimensional reconfigurable coupled butterfly units (2D-RCBFUs) is fine-grained reconfigured to improve resource utilization. Moreover, the low-complexity memory mapping scheme simplifies the address control logic and reduces the hardware overhead. can efficiently support the PM of an arbitrary power of two, which is impossible for previous designs using a 2D computing array. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, our demonstrates the best memory utilization, achieving up to $10.0\times$ performance improvement.",

        "abstract": "Lattice-based cryptography (LBC) exploits the learning with errors (LWE) problem and is the main algorithm standardized for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Number theoretic transforms (NTT) account for most of the latency and energy in the computation of the LWE problem. This work presents a Compute-in-Memory (CIM) configurable-pipeline NTT accelerator for PQC. The accelerator incorporates a bidirectional pipeline array to minimize data latency, CIM processing elements to reduce memory access, and a parallel PQC circuit for LBC protocol deployment. A 28 nm chip of the accelerator consumes only 13 nJ per 256-point NTT, while achieving a throughput of 75.6 KOPS that achieves a remarkable reduction of up to 78 clock cycles and a 45% reduction in energy consumption than state-of-the-art designs.",

        "abstract": "Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is currently being standardized to replace the existing public-key cryptography for data security in the era of quantum computing. PQC algorithms exhibit considerable diversity in their underlying mathematical problems, storage requirements, and computational patterns, thus complicating unified PQC architecture design. To address this issue, a unified PQC domain-specific accelerator (DSA), post-quantum processing unit (PQPU), is proposed to address the trade-off between performance and flexibility at the algorithm, architecture, and circuit levels. First, a task-clustering-based framework is proposed to enable task-level parallel execution by utilizing the inherent parallelism and common functions across different PQC algorithms. Second, a region-based dynamically updated task path (TP) is constructed to facilitate automatic task-dependency management, with agile control flow and minimized overheads. Finally, algorithm-hardware co-optimizations are proposed in each task cluster to improve throughput and energy efficiency. Fabricated in a 28-nm process, PQPU has energy efficiency and throughput of 4.4\nÎ¼\nJ/Op and 69.4 kOPS. The energy-delay product (EDP) and throughput achieved are 19.3% and 44.6% compared to the state-of-the-art design, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, PQPU is the first silicon-proven PQC accelerator that supports all valid schemes in NIST PQC standardization.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing raises questions about the security of data encrypted using modern methods. Hence, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has undertaken standardization of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms to defend against attacks from both classical and quantum computers. Following four rounds of evaluation, CRYSTALS-Kyber has been selected for standardization. In this paper, we present an efficient hardware architecture of CRYSTALS-Kyber for resource-constrained IoT devices. Firstly, we propose a compact hash module for CRYSTALS-Kyber. A single buffer is designed to perform padding, hashing, and holding data. Hence, using large FIFOs for data input/output is eliminated. Then, we propose a novel non-memory-based iterative number theoretic transform (NMI-NTT) architecture. Finally, the data flow between modules is optimized to improve parallelization and execution time. Implementation results on an Artix-7 FPGA show that our design consumes minimal hardware resources compared to the designs reported to date, corresponding to 5487 LUTs, 3426 FFs, 1548 SLICEs, 3.5 BRAMs, and 2 DSPs. Our design computes key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation phases in 3.3/4.5/6.1 K-cycles for Kyber512, 5.6/7.1/9.2 K-cycles for Kyber768, and 8.5/10.1/12.9 K-cycles for Kyber1024, with 185MHz operating frequency. Our area-time-product (ATP) performance outperforms other designs.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in beyond 5G (B5G) are crucial for revolutionizing various industries, including surveillance, agriculture, and logistics, by enabling high-speed data transfer, ultra-low latency communication, and ultra-reliable connectivity. However, integrating UAVs into B5G networks poses various security and privacy concerns. These risks encompass the possibility of unauthorized access, breaches of data, and cyber-physical attacks which jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of UAV operations. Moreover, UAVs in B5G networks are also at high risk from the application of machine learning (ML)-based attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in ML models, leading to adversarial manipulation, data poisoning and model evasion techniques, which can compromise the integrity of UAV operations, lead to navigation errors, and expose sensitive data collected by UAVs. Considering the aforementioned security and privacy concerns, this review article presents emerging security and privacy solutions for UAVs in B5G networks. Firstly, We introduce the essential background of integrating UAVs into B5G networks and discuss the advantages and security challenges which the emerging integrated network architecture have. Then, we proceed to analyze and examine the security and privacy landscape by including threats and requirements of UAVs in B5G networks. Based on these threats and requirements, solutions from physical layer security (PLS), blockchain (BC), federated learning (FL) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are discussed and explored in details. Moreover, potential future research directions are discussed in details as open research issues.",

        "abstract": "A smart grid (SG), sometimes known as an electric grid, is a very reliable, efficient, as well as secure method of delivering data on particular participants. Researchers and the power industry are becoming increasingly interested in SG because of its varied responsibilities. To achieve secure communication in SG environment, there is a need to establish a key exchange between participants. In an SG environment, a number of key exchange techniques have been developed for secure communication. Nevertheless, the most of them do not offer anonymity and function inadequately for SG communication. In this paper, we propose a robus key exchanged and authentication protocol for SG environment using elliptic curve cryptography. The proposed protocol provides anonymity and mutual authentication between participants in SG environment. In addition to an informal security analysis, we offer a formal security analysis of the proposed protocol based on the random oracle model. Further, we provide comparison of the security and functionality features of the proposed protocol with existing ECC based protocols. A performance analysis in terms of computational and communication costs is carried out in comparison with existing dozen advanced authentication and key exchanged protocols, showing the superiority of the proposed protocol. Our protocol achieves high security with minimum computational and communication costs. The computational cost is reduced â 79.64%, cost of communication is reduced â 71.54%, while energy consumption reduced to â 79.65% respectively of the mean value of all alternatives, thus proving the robustness of the presented protocol for securing SG communications.",

        "abstract": "The threat posed by quantum computing has precipitated an urgent need for post-quantum cryptography. Recently, the post-quantum digital signature draft FIPS 204 has been published, delineating the details of the ML-DSA, which is derived from the CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Despite these advancements, server environments, especially those equipped with GPU devices necessitating high- throughput signing, remain entrenched in classical schemes. A conspicuous void exists in the realm of GPU implementation or server-specific designs for ML-DSA. In this paper, we propose the first server-oriented GPU design tailored for the ML-DSA signing procedure in high- throughput servers. We introduce several innovative theoretical optimizations to bolster performance, including depth-prior sparse ternary polynomial multiplication, the branch elimination method, and the rejection-prioritized checking order. Furthermore, exploiting server-oriented features, we propose a comprehensive GPU hardware design, augmented by a suite of GPU implementation optimizations to further amplify performance. Additionally, we present variants for sampling sparse polynomials, thereby streamlining our design. The deployment of our implementation on both server-grade and commercial GPUs demonstrates significant speedups, ranging from 284.9Ã to 485.3Ã against the CPU baseline, and an improvement of up to 60.9% compared to related work, affirming the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed GPU architecture for ML-DSA signing procedure",

        "abstract": "Digital twins (DT) are digital copies of tangible assets and operations utilised in some industries to improve efficiency and foster creativity, accuracy, and decision making. Although beneficial, they have brought up some of the most critical security issues due to the complexity of their implementation and how they are incorporated into strategic systems. In this study, the security aspects of DTs that deal with challenges relating to data integrity, privacy, and secrecy are covered: potential vulnerabilities. For example, data used for malicious reasons, gaining unauthorised access, and interference with authorised network activities are considered in the planned attempt. In this study, the authors provide a secure and efficient protocol based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to address security, privacy, and associated concerns in vehicular digital twins (VDT) networks. In addition, the paper discusses formal and informal security analysis based on the random oracle model, Burrows-Abadi Needham (BAN) logic, and Scyther verification tool. The proposed protocol ensures security, privacy, and other related security attacks and attributes in VDT networks. Furthermore, in the performance analysis section, we compare the communication and computation costs of the proposed protocol and related protocols. The proposed framework is secure and efficient in VDT network systems. Our analysis shows that the proposed protocol may apply to future VDT networks.",

Subsequently, we present the lower and upper bounds on the minimum symplectic distances of a class of 1-generator QC codes and their symplectic dual codes by decomposing code spaces. As an application, we construct numerous new binary symplectic self-orthogonal QC codes with excellent parameters, leading to 117 record-breaking quantum error-correction codes.",

        "abstract": "Silicon optical switches show great potential in building the next generation of flexible switching nodes. However, due to the birefringence nature of silicon waveguides, most of them are polarization sensitive, which significantly affects their practical applications. Here, we demonstrate an integrated polarization-diversity crossbar optical switch on a multi-layer Si3N4-on-SOI platform, capable of handling random polarization states. The optical switch demonstrates exceptional performance, with fiber-to-fiber insertion losses ranging from 4.16 to 6.59 dB and polarization-dependent losses from 0.32 to 1.88 dB. The transmission spectra exhibit a box-like shape with an optical bandwidth of â¼52 GHz and crosstalk below -32 dB. Furthermore, the power consumption of a single switch element is reduced to 46 mW by removing the silicon substrate under the phase shifter, which is only 1/8 of our previous work without undercuts. This research provides strong proof for the practical application of optical switches in optical communication systems.",

        "abstract": "Classical cluster-based side-channel analysis (SCA) uses clustering algorithms to analyze power traces and often, principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of data, resulting in that clustering may not deal well with high-dimensional traces such as cryptographic algorithm implementations with countermeasures. In this paper, we propose an intelligent framework for cluster-based SCA, which includes three steps of clustering, classification and correction, for processing large high-dimensional data. By combining unsupervised clustering and supervised deep learning techniques, the framework succeeds in mining the data for additional in-depth information. In addition, unlike traditional cluster-based SCA, our approach focuses on deep learning and deliberately avoids over-reliance on cluster labels during classification. And metrics for correction are adopted to achieve a high level of reliability in key recovery. Experiments on the RSA smart card based on Montgomery ladder implementation and FPGA-based ECC with random delay demonstrate that our framework can significantly improve the success rate with strong robustness.",

        "abstract": "To accelerate RNS-CKKS, little attention is paid to the acceleration of the operations on the edge-client. However, the devices used by the edge-client are often low-end and have limited resources and computing power, so the performance of RNSCKKS encoding, decoding, encryption and decryption also needs to be improved. Consequently, we propose a compact and efficient hardware accelerator architecture named CAEA for these operations. In order to improve the compactness of CAEA, a reconfigurable butterfly unit is proposed, which considers both complex number arithmetic and integer modular arithmetic, so that FFT/IFFT and NTT/INTT can be executed on unified hardware processing elements without additional resource and waste. Moreover, in order to improve the computational efficiency, we also improved the dataflow of encoding, decoding, encryption, and decryption on CAEA to reduce the number of required operations and latency. CAEA is synthesized based on SMIC 40nm technology, and is also implemented on Xilinx Kintex-7 and Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA. Compared with the prior related works, in terms of performance, CAEA can achieve 2.01Ã speedup for encoding and decoding, 1.13Ã ~ 87.86Ã speedup for encryption, and 3.03Ã ~ 69.64Ã speedup for decryption. Compared with the state-of-the-art work, CAEA can achieve 1.06Ã ~ 4.96Ã improvement in terms of area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "As a basic primitive in spatial and multimedia databases, the k\n-nearest neighbors ( k\n-NN) query has been widely used in electronic medicine, location-based services and so on. With the boom in cloud computing, it is currently a trend to upload massive data to the cloud server to enjoy its powerful storage and computing resources. Recently, research communities and commercial applications have proposed many schemes to support k\n-NN query on cloud data. However, most of the existing schemes were designed under the assumption that the query users (QUs) are fully trusted and hold the key of the data owner (DO). In this case, even if the queries were encrypted, the QUs can capture the query content from each other, leading to the query privacy leakage. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, few k\n-NN query schemes can ensure data security and result verification under the key confidentiality condition. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and privacy-preserving k\n-NN query scheme with multiple keys (VP k\nNN), in which each QU's partial private key can only decrypt the encrypted query results belonging to its own , but not the encrypted database, the encrypted query data and query results of other QUs. Moreover, our proposal not only answers the query efficiently, but also ensures the privacy of the data, the query and the result, and the verification of the correctness of the results. Finally, the complexity and security are theoretically analyzed, and the practicality and efficiency of our proposed scheme are compared by simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "With constrained resources, the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) craves for lightweight and robust access authentication protocols to secure the network. Existing physical unclonable functions (PUFs) based cryptographic protocols face privacy threats from wireless environments and semitrusted participants, while physical layer authentication (PLA) is costly as a complementary protocol to upper layer. Therefore, in this paper we propose a cross-layer mutual authentication with key agreement protocol based on PUFs for IIoT. The proposed protocol integrates PUFsâ challenge-response pairs (CRPs) into low-complexity cryptographic primitives and signal phases of subcarriers, employs a newly designed authentication decision methodology, and achieves excellent authentication performance while reducing protocol redundancy. Our protocol also provides device anonymity, dynamic updates, and storage-free CRPs to defend against potential insider threats. The security of the proposed protocol has been formally and informally verified. The performance analysis results show that our protocol provides better security and privacy performance with low computation and communication cost. The simulation results show the protocol can obtain great authentication performance in the indoor factory (InF) wireless scenario of the 3GPP TR 38.901 standard.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) chips are regularly exposed to physical attacks and faced to the compromise of information security. An attacker leverages Si substrate backside as the open surface of an IC chip in flip-chip packaging and explores the points of information leakage over the entire backside without being hampered by physical obstacles as well as applying invasive treatments. Physical side channels (SCs), e.g., voltage potentials, current flows, electromagnetic (EM) waves, and photons, are transparent through Si substrate and attributed to the operation of security ICs. An attacker measures SCs using probes as well as antennas and correlates them with secret information, such as secret key bytes used in a cryptographic processor or analog quantities at the frontend of internet-of-things (IoT) gadgets. This paper defines and elucidates the emerging threats of Si-substrate backside attacks on flipped IC chips, demonstrates attacks and proposes countermeasures.",

        "abstract": "Zero trust for wireless networks (ZTWN) is a model to ensure that all network traffic, including wireless connections, is considered untrusted and requires authentication and authorization, regardless of the network location or user identity. The infrastructure of zero trust depends on classical cryptographic techniques to guarantee the necessary security measures. Unfortunately, quantum computing has the potential to break many cryptographic techniques, which could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over ZTWN. Therefore, we explored the integration of various quantum components as potential solutions to enhance and achieve the security objectives of ZTWN in the long term. Furthermore, three different quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have been investigated on two anomaly detection datasets; the achieved accuracies outperform the implemented classical. Quantum identity authentication (QIA) and quantum communication protocols leverage quantum properties, such as quantum entanglement and superposition have been developed to ensure secure and tamper-proof communication between ZTWN entities. The security analysis of the proposed protocols against inside and outside attacks proved that attackers cannot extract any secret information.",

        "abstract": "In edge computing environments, the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents significant challenges for data processing. These devices are often resource-constrained, eading to a trade-off between achieving efficiency and ensuring security. On one hand, traditional certificateless encryption methods are computationally expensive; on the other hand, offloading the computational load to third-party entities can enhance efficiency but still introduces security risks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight certificateless edge-assisted encryption scheme (CL-EAED). Ours scheme offloads computationally intensive tasks to edge servers, ensuring that edge-assisted processing does not expose sensitive information and only needs to be performed once. This approach effectively prevents data leakage and enhances both the efficiency and security of task offloading. Moreover, the CL-EAED scheme achieves IND-CCA security in standard model (SM) and has been validated using the ProVerif tool. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CL-EAED eliminates the dependency on computationally intensive pairing operations, significantly reducing computational and communication costs. It outperforms existing solutions in terms of energy consumption, latency, and scalability, fully meeting the requirements of practical applications.",

        "abstract": "High-performance (HP) elliptic curve scalar multiplication (ECSM) hardware implementations hold significant importance in ensuring communication security in high-capacity and high-concurrence application scenarios. By analyzing the inherent priorities and parallelism in ECSMs, we proposed a novel HP ECSM algorithm and a partially parallel inversion algorithm based on the interleaved mechanism. With two dedicated multipliers and one interleaved multiplier, we introduced a compact hardware scheduling scheme to realize the consumption of four clock cycles within each loop of ECSM. The proposed HP ECSM architecture consists of two Karatsuba-Ofman multipliers (KOMs) and one classical multiplier (CM). The multiplexors and pipeline stages are meticulously designed to optimize the critical path (CP). The proposed architecture is implemented over Virtex-7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and the throughput reaches 158.03, 138.23, and 117.50 Mbps over $\text{GF}(2^{163})$ , $\text{GF}(2^{283})$ , and $\text{GF}(2^{571})$ using 8762, 20 451, and 41 974 slices, respectively. The comparisons with recent existing works demonstrate that the performance and throughput of our design are among the top.",

        "abstract": "In networks, clients access various servers. Servers need to authenticate clients' identities and provide services to clients who pass the authentication. Password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication (PbT-SSO) delegates multiple identity servers to authenticate a client with the client's password, and issue a token for subsequent access. However, existing PbT-SSO schemes are based on conventional hardness problems, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum computers in the near future. Once quantum computers are accessible, adversaries can retrieve passwords by off-line dictionary guessing attacks (DGA) from the credentials of clients' passwords. Moreover, quantum adversaries can derive identity servers' secret from public information and further forge tokens with the secret. Motivated by these issues, we propose a password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication from learning with errors problem (LWE), dubbed LPbT-SSO, which is resistant to quantum attacks. LPbT-SSO evaluates a one-way function of passwords, and takes the function outputs as credentials. Since the function is grounded on LWE problem intractable for quantum computation, quantum adversaries cannot recover passwords by off-line DGA. Additionally, LPbT-SSO leverages a lattice-based threshold signature scheme to issue tokens, and guarantees that no adversary can forge a valid token. The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that LPbT-SSO is efficient in terms of computation, storage, and communication costs.",

        "abstract": "The rapid evolution of GPUs has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating the worldwide used SSL/TLS, which faces performance bottlenecks due to its underlying heavy cryptographic computations. Nevertheless, substantial structural adjustments from the parallel mode of GPUs to the serial mode of the SSL/TLS stack are imperative, potentially constraining the practical deployment of GPUs.\nIn this paper, we propose AsyncGBP+, a three-level framework that facilitates the seamless conversion of cryptographic requests from synchronous to asynchronous mode. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the OpenSSL provider and cryptographic primitive features relevant to GPU implementations, aiming to fully exploit the potential of GPUs. Notably, AsyncGBP+ supports three working settings (offline/online/hybrid), finely tailored for various public key cryptographic primitives, including traditional ones like X25519, Ed25519, ECDSA, and the quantum-safe CRYSTALS-Kyber. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that AsyncGBP+ can efficiently achieve an improvement of up to 137.8Ã compared to the default OpenSSL provider (for X25519, Ed25519, ECDSA) and 113.30Ã compared to OpenSSL-compatible liboqs (for CRYSTALS-Kyber) in a single-process setting. Furthermore, AsyncGBP+ surpasses the current fastest commercial-off-the-shelf OpenSSL-compatible TLS accelerator with a 5.3Ã to 7.0Ã performance improvement.",

        "abstract": "The future of Internet is envisioned as the Internet of Things (IoT), a concept where countless physical objects, many of which possess limited or minimal resources, interact with one another autonomously, eliminating the need for human involvement. In the development of IoT, one of the primary concerns is security and privacy protection of end-users. Ensuring the confidentiality of communication is crucial across a range of applications, particularly in situations where communication devices have various limitations. Traditional encryption algorithms like Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are computationally demanding and necessitate significant memory resources, leading to potential performance drawbacks on IoT devices. Basic encryption methods are susceptible to being compromised easily. Hence, altered editions of the highly efficient lightweight cipher eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm (XTEA) has been proposed in this paper. The key scheduling of XTEA has been substituted with the key scheduling algorithm of an ultra-lightweight block cipher PRESENT and this modified version is named as PREXTEA. Additionally, the integration of key-bit generation mechanism of a lightweight stream cipher TRIVIUM, resulted in an enhanced version of XTEA named as TRIXTEA. Consequently, the strength of the original cipher has been enhanced with improved performance parameters.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a modified quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol based on card-shuffling, designed to enhance security against eavesdropper photon number splitting (PNS) strategies. The proposed technique accommodates light pulses with few photons, substantially augmenting the effectiveness and reliability of QKD. It can be implemented as multi-photon-lane systems, enabling concurrent key distribution to multiple users or amalgamation of key data to amplify individual user key rates. The study assesses the proposed technique utilizing three well-established polarization-encrypted QKD protocols, BB84, B92, and SSP99, and simulations utilizing 4-photon lane systems with wavelengths of 800 nm, 1300 nm, and 1550 nm. The findings, encompassing correlations such as useful key rate, maximum key distribution distance, quantum bit error rate, and photon number probability, are analyzed and compared under different conditions. The outcomes reveal that combining the technique with BB84-based systems employing 1300 nm light pulses and a photon number probability of 1.0 attains a maximum QKD effectiveness of 12.34 Gbit-km/s. Moreover, the effectiveness can be increased to 49.36 Gbit-km/s by implementing the proposed 4-photon-lane system as the serial key-combining scheme. The potential of using multi-photon-lane implementations alongside the proposed technique to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of QKD is theoretically investigated and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Conventional cryptographic systems protect the data security during communication but give third-party cloud operators complete access to compute decrypted user data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) promises to rectify this and allow computations on encrypted data to be done without actually decrypting it. However, HE encryption requires several orders of magnitude higher latency than conventional encryption schemes. Number theoretic transform (NTT), a polynomial multiplication algorithm, is the bottleneck function in HE. In traditional architectures, memory accesses and support for parallel operations limit NTTâs throughput and energy efficiency. Processing in memory (PIM) is an interesting approach that can maximize parallelism with high-energy efficiency. To enable HE on resource-constrained edge devices, this article presents MBSNTT, a digital in-memory Multi-Bit-Serial NTT accelerator, achieving high parallelism and energy efficiency for NTT with minimized area. MBSNTT features a novel multi-bit-serial modular multiplication algorithm and PIM implementation that computes all modular multiplications in an NTT in parallel. It further adopts a constant geometry NTT data flow for efficient transition between NTT stages and different cores. Our evaluation shows that MBSNTT achieves 1.62 $\times$ (19.08 $\times$ ) higher throughput and 64.9 $\times$ (2.06 $\times$ ) lower energy than state-of-the-art PIM NTT accelerators Crypto-PIM (MeNTT), at a polynomial order of 8 K and bit width of 128.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement in consumer technology has led to an exponential increase in the connected devices, resulting in an enormous and continuous flow of data, particularly the image data. This data needs to be processed, managed, and secured efficiently, especially in the quantum-enabled consumer technology era. This paper, in this regards, presents a quantum image encryption scheme featuring a novel two-phase chaotic confusion-diffusion architecture. The proposed architecture consists of four distinct confusion-diffusion modules that perform a simultaneous qubit and pixel-level encryption on both the position and intensity of quantum encoded pixels. Moreover, quantum circuits for âqubit-level chaotic transformationâ and âchaos-based selective perfect shuffle operationâ have been implemented, which collectively enhance the encryption strength of the proposed scheme. Extensive evaluation has been performed based on various statistical security parameters, such as entropy and correlation. When subjected to differential attacks, the proposed scheme proved its resilience exhibiting ideal results of average 99.6% NPCR (Number of Pixels Change Rate) and 33.5% UACI (Unified Average Changing Intensity). Besides, the proposed scheme also demonstrated resilience against occlusion attacks. Tests involving 50% data occlusion from encrypted images validated the proposed schemeâs capability to successfully decrypt the tampered images, recovering maximum information.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have be-come widely used due to their environmental friendliness. How-ever, the increase in essential supporting Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) has led to a large and diverse cryptograph-ic demand for charging aggregators. The growing demand for computational power cannot be met by local cryptographic com-puting clusters, while cryptographic computing services on the cloud bring risks such as cross-VM (cross-Virtual-Machine) at-tacks. Meeting the requirements of security and timeliness simul-taneously poses challenges for cryptographic service architecture and scheduling algorithms. To address these challenges, a heter-ogeneous task processing architecture is proposed to integrate local and cloud computing resources. Next, a task queue is con-structed to transform the dynamic scheduling problem of multi-ple cryptographic tasks into a queue-jumping sequential deci-sion-making problem. By modeling security requirements as con-straints, the problem is modeled as a Constrained Markov Deci-sion Process (CMDP) formulation. A Deep Reinforcement Learn-ing (DRL) method with recurrent networks and a safe action mechanism are proposed to solve the formulation, which utilizes the temporal characteristics of cryptographic tasks to achieve better scheduling performance under constraints. Finally, com-pared with the state-of-the-art method, our proposed approach is validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating supe-rior security and enhanced processing efficiency across various scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Generative AI is revolutionizing Software Engineering (SE), as both engineers and academics embrace this technology in their work. To better leverage this technology for software generation, it is essential to propose effective IoT software defect prediction methods. However, this task is challenging due to the unclear high-order correlation underlying the data. Moreover, in real-world IoT software defect prediction applications, different types of misclassifications generally lead to distinct losses and associated costs. However, accurately determining these specific costs is often not feasible. Under such circumstances, we propose a cost-sensitive hypergraph learning method with structure quality preservation (csHLQ) to optimize the cost information and preserve the graph quality in a principled way. Due to the representational ability on high-order relationship exploring, we employ hypergraph structure instead of graph structure to model the complex correlations among the datasets. We note that if a cost-sensitive hypergraph has a high quality, its classification results may exhibit a large margin separation. Thus, csHLQ exploits the large margin cost-sensitive hypergraph while avoiding using of a cost-sensitive hypergraph with a small margin. To measure the performance of our proposed method, we performed experiments on three distinct groups of datasets, i.e., the NASA Metrics Data Program (NASA) dataset, CK metric dataset and UCI Machine Learning Repository (UCI) dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

        "abstract": "Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Field-Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs) are reconfigurable circuits that enable flexible digital and analog implementations post-manufacturing. FPGAs are widely used in telecommunications, mixed-signal, and embedded systems due to their parallel processing and reconfigurability. Meanwhile, FPAAs provide flexibility for analog systems, which is crucial for modern mixed-signal processing. This study introduces ANUBIS, a hybrid system combining FPGA and FPAA technologies to generate true random numbers (TRNGs) for secure UAV communication. Due to its reliability and cost efficiency, ANUBIS leverages a thermistor circuit as an entropy source. The FPAA amplifies the analog noise generated by the thermistor, while the FPGA digitizes and processes the signal using Von Neumann Whitening (VNW) to remove bias. The ASCON hash function is applied to the whitened bitstream to generate cryptographically secure keys. These keys are utilized in a DHKE to enable secure communication via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an ideal protocol for energy-constrained UAV applications. ANUBIS demonstrates reconfigurability, power efficiency, and ease of implementation, showcasing its potential for secure communication applications. It achieves robust randomization, setting a new standard for UAV communication security and addressing applications requiring reliable TRNG solutions. The system consumes 1.615 W in total, with 1.54 W consumed by the FPGA and 75 mW by the FPAA. Resource utilization on the PYNQ-Z1 board includes 5,186 LUTs (9.75%), 549 units of memory (3.15%), and 5.5 units of BRAM (3.93%), indicating moderate resource usage with room for future enhancements. By integrating reliable analog noise harvesting with efficient digital post-processing, ANUBIS offers a novel approach to TRNG design, demonstrating the potential for broader cryptographic applications in resource-constrained environments.",

The EPI project traced the roadmap to develop the first family of low-power processors with the design fully made in Europe, for Big Data, supercomputers and automotive. Each of the coprocessors of Crypto-Tile is dedicated to a specific family of cryptographic algorithms, offering functions for symmetric and public-key cryptography, computation of digests, generation of random numbers, and Post-Quantum cryptography. The performances of each coprocessor outperform other available solutions, offering innovative hardware-native services, such as key management, clock randomisation and access privilege mechanisms. The system has been synthesised on a 7 nm standard-cell technology, being the first Cryptoprocessor to be characterised in such an advanced silicon technology. The post-synthesis netlist has been employed to assess the resistance of Crypto-Tile to power analysis side-channel attacks. Finally, a demoboard has been implemented, integrating a RISC-V softcore processor and the Crypto-Tile module, and drivers for hardware abstraction layer, bare-metal applications and drivers for Linux kernel in C language have been developed. Finally, we exploited them to compare in terms of execution speed the hardware-accelerated algorithms against software-only solutions.",

        "abstract": "Public Key Management systems enable users to create, validate, and revoke public keys, serving as the foundation of public key cryptography. Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems rely on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs) to validate users and manage public keys, but this centralization creates a single point of failure. If a CA is compromised, it can register fake public keys or alter legitimate ones, leading to counterfeit certificates. While blockchain-based approaches decentralize CA authority across multiple entities, these solutions are largely reactive, focusing on certificate issuance and relying on user signatures for validation. They lack a robust mechanism to authenticate and authorize requests before certificate issuance, a crucial step typically managed by Registration Authorities (RA) in CA-based PKI systems. To address this gap, we introduce PKChain, a novel compromise-tolerant and verifiable public key management system built on blockchain. PKChain addresses two key challenges: it uses a Threshold Block Validation (TBV) scheme for key request validation, where validators partially validate requests and collaborate for full validation. Once a request gains majority approval, it advances to the Aggregated Commitment Signature (ACS) scheme, where validators collectively issue certificates. By requiring majority approval in the TBV stage before moving to certificate issuance, PKChain ensures proactive security throughout the process. To achieve consensus on validation and issuance, we propose a threshold cryptography-based consensus mechanism called the practical Byzantine Compromise-tolerant and Verifiable (pBCTV) consensus model, integrating TBV and ACS schemes with the practical Byzantine Fault-tolerance (pBFT) protocol. Security analysis, performance evaluation, and prototype implementation validate PKChainâs security, efficiency, and resilience.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, many researchers design certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) authentication schemes with pseudonyms for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to ensure data integrity, source authentication, and user privacy-preserving. Unfortunately, our analysis reveals that even the state-of-the-art schemes cannot be directly applied to VANETs as they are either not entirely secure or inefficient. Therefore, building on the insights of previous research, we propose a secure and efficient CLAS scheme with pseudonyms for VANETs, which is based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) construction and without bilinear pairing (pairing-free). Then, we specifically introduce the generalized forking lemma to enhance the transparency of the security proof process. Based on standard cryptographic assumptions, we prove that the proposed CLAS scheme can withstand attacks from Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 adversaries while satisfying various security and privacy requirements in VANETs. Finally, performance analysis shows that compared to the latest pairing-free CLAS schemes in VANETs, the proposed CLAS scheme not only offers more comprehensive security but also has lower computational and communication overhead. Additionally, we also utilized the MIRACL cryptography library for simulation experiments, and the results indicate that the proposed scheme still performs lower overhead in practical simulation environments, making it more suitable for resource-constrained VANET environments.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular networks have huge potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency, especially in the context of large models. Cloud computing can significantly improve the performance of vehicular networks, and the concept of cloud-assisted vehicular networks comes into being. Reputation management plays a crucial role in vehicular networks, since it can help each vehicle evaluate the trustworthiness of the other vehicles and the received messages. Reputation updating is essential in reputation management and it is usually done by the Trusted Authority (TA) regularly after collecting, decrypting, and verifying a large number of reputation feedbacks, which leads to great computation and communication overheads on the TA side and even makes the TA become the bottleneck of reputation management system. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Reputation Updating (PPRU) scheme for cloud-assisted vehicular networks based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Paillier algorithms, in which the reputation feedbacks are collected and preprocessed by the honest-but-curious Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a privacy-preserving manner, and the computation and communication overheads on the TA side can be dramatically reduced by about 88.36% and 83.88% as a result, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme can provide strong privacy preservation, strong security, and robust reputation management with acceptable computation and communication overheads. Furthermore, the comprehensive theoretical analysis and simulation evaluation are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is significantly superior to the existing schemes in several aspects.",

        "abstract": "The Mobile crowdsourcing network (MCN) leverages collaborative intelligence to solve complex tasks through group cooperation. It comprises three main components: the end-user, the service provider, and the mobile user. The end-user requests crowd-sensing and computing services from the service provider, who handles task decomposition, distribution, re-composition, and recommendation. Mobile users perform the crowd sensing and computing tasks. Despite its benefits, MCN faces significant security and privacy challenges. Communications between the service provider and the end-user involve sensitive data, and mobile users and service providers communicate over open channels, making them vulnerable to security threats. To address these concerns, we propose a secure authentication framework for MCN, called SAF-MCN. This framework combines the lightweight cryptographic primitive â ASCONâ with elliptic curve cryptography. SAF-MCN allows the service provider to authenticate mobile users before they join the MCN. Once authenticated, a secure channel is established for encrypted communication over the public Internet. The security of SAFMCN is validated using both formal and informal methods, demonstrating its resilience against potential attacks. The use of Scyther further ensures the security of SAF-MCN. Comparative analysis shows that SAF-MCN is superior in terms of security features, computational efficiency, and communication cost.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a McEliece hardware accelerator designed to be attached to an AXI infrastructure, addressing the efficient implementation of a flexible post-quantum cryptoprocessor on FPGA-based embedded systems. The complexity of the arithmetic circuits, combined with the adaptability to different applications by configurable parameters and run-time reprogramming, presents challenging issues for integrating the accelerator into these systems. The architecture of the accelerator is based on an application-specific instruction processor (ASIP), which executes a set of constant-time instructions from an internal register file and memories. The register file is used to perform instructions on Goppa codes over polynomials, whereas the vector memory is used when operations with binary matrices and vectors that are involved in the McEliece algorithm. The role of the embedded processor is reduced to the initial writing of the instruction memory of the accelerator, the launching of the required set of instructions to complete each stage of the algorithm and configuring the Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller to retrieve and store data from external memory. The run-time programming of the accelerator provides high flexibility in applications that requires post-quantum cryptography. A set of configurable parameters permits to adapt the security level of the McEliece encryption-decryption (n, m, t) and the area-performance tradeoff imposed by the target device. Thus, the accelerator can be implemented from low-cost to high-end FPGAs by configuring the data-width of DMA buses or the parallelism level of the Galois-Field adder-multiplier. Experimental results show the accelerator is suited for implementing efficiently the highest security parameters of the Classic McEliece, achieving a McEliece decryption speed-up from x370 to x556 and occupying a small number of resources on a low-cost FPGA. In high-end FPGAs, the accelerator can be configured using higher security parame...",

        "abstract": "To address the issues of poor user privacy protection and insecure communication in the Internet of Medical Things(IoMT) environment, we propose a blockchain-based lightweight mutual authentication scheme for the IoMT. Firstly, our scheme is a two-factor authentication scheme that uses certificates and feature information for identity authentication. Secondly, we use elliptic curve cryptography and the Chinese remainder theorem to design a lightweight identity registration and authentication algorithm. This algorithm can aggregate multiple identity information of users for verification, while achieving efficient user identity authentication and ensuring the security of user identity information. Finally, we combined non-fungible tokens (NFT) with user device information, and through a composable NFT solution, we ensured the uniqueness and immutability of user identity information on the blockchain, while facilitating user identity management. The formal security analysis based on AVISPA has proven the security of our scheme. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has low communication and storage overhead. We simulated the proposed scheme on the Ethereum platform using the Solidity language and conducted latency and throughput analysis of our smart contracts using the stress testing tool Hyperledger Caliper. The results illustrate the practicality of our scheme.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology, renowned for its ability to securely store data, hashes, and signatures permanently, faces unprecedented challenges in secure Consumer IoT (CIoT) networks with the advent of quantum computing. This paper proposes a set of robust quantum-based protocols and techniques to address these challenges by enhancing the security, scalability, and reliability of CIoT systems in the face of quantum threats. Updating the blockchain infrastructure is imperative to ensure ongoing security, which involves forks or protocol adjustments to establish new post-quantum chains and addresses, requiring rapid data and asset migration by users. Blockchain guarantees data integrity through an immutable ledger of transactions distributed via cryptographic hashes. The proposed quantum protocols and techniques enhance scalability and reliability and address the unique security needs of both commercial and governmental applications in secure CIoT networks through immersive embedded cyber-physical systems. These include Quantum Currency Security Protocols, Distributed Ledger Data Blocks, Quantum Ledger Verification, Quantum Solutions for Middleman Attacks, and the integration of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based security measures. By integrating these methods, the proposed approach ensures robust protection against emerging quantum threats, thereby securing sensitive information and transactions.",

        "abstract": "Cubic operations are among the most used arithmetic operations in many applications that demand higher order simultaneous operand computation, such as cryptography and bicubic polynomial interpolation. This article proposes a novel VLSI radix- 2^m\ncubic unit (RCU- 2^m\n) capable of processing cubic operations at m\nbits simultaneously, with m\nvalues of 2 (RCU-4), 3 (RCU-8), and 4 (RCU-16). RCU-16 emerges as the most area-efficient configuration, surpassing RCU-8 and notably outperforming RCU-4. In the 8-bit scenario, RCU-16 achieves remarkable area savings, surpassing the literatureâs proposed cubic unit by 11.58\times\n. Across all configurations, RCU- 2^m\nconsistently outperforms the automatically selected cube unit, with energy savings ranging from 1.04\times\nto 2\times\n. In application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based analyses, RCU-16 consistently exhibits superior performance in both area and energy savings compared with RCU-4, RCU-8, and solutions from the literature. These findings emphasize the importance of adopting radix- 2^m\nconfigurations, particularly RCU-16, for optimal energy-constrained VLSI applications.",

        "abstract": "Fueled by its successful commercialization, the recommender system (RS) has gained widespread attention. However, as the training data fed into the RS models are often highly sensitive, it ultimately leads to severe privacy concerns, especially when data are shared among different platforms. In this paper, we follow the tune of existing works to investigate the problem of secure sparse matrix multiplication for cross-platform RSs. Two fundamental and critical issues are addressed: preserving the training data privacy and breaking the data silo problem. Specifically, we propose two concrete constructions with significantly boosted efficiency. They are designed for the sparse location insensitive case and location sensitive case, respectively. State-of-the-art cryptography building blocks including homomorphic encryption (HE) and private information retrieval (PIR) are fused into our protocols with non-trivial optimizations. As a result, our schemes can enjoy the HE acceleration technique without privacy trade-offs. We give formal security proofs for the proposed schemes and conduct extensive experiments on both real and large-scale simulated datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art works, our two schemes compress the running time roughly by $10\times$ and $2.8\times$ . They also attain up to $15\times$ and $2.3\times$ communication reduction without accuracy loss.",

        "abstract": "In cryptography, side-channel analysis (SCA) is a technique used to recover cryptographic keys by examining the physical leakages that occur during the operation of cryptographic devices. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have greatly enhanced the extraction of crucial information from intricate leakage patterns. A considerable amount of research is dedicated to studying the SubByte (SB) operations of the advanced encryption standard (AES). This is because the SB process, which generates numerous transitions between 0s and 1s during encryption, results in significant energy leakage. However, traditional analysis models primarily focus on the initial round of SB operations in AES, which are less effective on mobile terminals where it is difficult to collect enough signals. These models often neglect additional operations and subsequent rounds, thus providing limited insights from small datasets. Consequently, this limitation has a direct impact on the accuracy and efficiency of key recovery. Our study uses Ï-test analysis to show that significant leakage occurs not only during the S-box operation but also during the AddRoundKey (AR) phase of AES. To address these challenges, we propose a new SCA method that is optimized for small sample sizes. This method includes a new comprehensive round trace labeling algorithm, which simultaneously analyzes the SB and AR stages of each AES round. Additionally, we introduce the peak precise localization algorithm to accurately identify the points of energy leakage during each encryption round. Our experiments, conducted with power and Electromagnetic (EM) datasets from the STM32F303 microcontroller, demonstrate that our method can reliably recover keys with as few as 20 traces. These results highlight the enhanced capability of our method in handling the complexities of small sample datasets in cryptographic analysis.",

        "abstract": "Privacy concerns have been persistently afflicting individuals within online social networks (OSNs), rendering privacy-preserving communications over the Internet with authentication especially important. Unfortunately, the guarantees of privacy and authenticity are not always provided in OSNs. Individuals are still facing the challenges of being deceived or exploited. To mitigate these issues, anonymous social networks (ASNs) have emerged as a remedy for OSNs, facilitating individuals to connect with others anonymously and authentically. Despite the existence of numerous and remarkable cryptographic primitives, there are no formal solutions for ASNs except for matchmaking encryption (ME), since ME can simultaneously provide various key functionalities, i.e. bilateral access control, identity anonymity, and message authentication, to address the requirements of ASNs. In this paper, we design a system for ASNs by adopting fuzzy identity-based matchmaking encryption (fuzzy IB-ME), and the proposed scheme in this work is highly efficient. The scheme also realizes adaptive security in generic group model (GGM), which is generally adopted in pairing-based cryptography. The proposed ASNs system offers various advantages compared to the previous solutions, including 1) bilateral access control, 2) enhanced security, 3) high scalability, and 4) high efficiency. In addition to theoretical evaluations, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our schemeâs computational and storage efficiency. These evaluations indicate that our solution outperforms previous solutions and as well as preserves many desired functionalities.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing poses a threat on current cryptography methods, prompting initiatives such as the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process toward developing post-quantum cryptographic tools. This process concentrates on deploying âkey encapsulation mechanismsâ and âsignature schemesâ, mainly focusing on Group Authenticated key exchange (GAKE), which is crucial for secure group communication while ensuring authentication is immune to quantum attacks. Despite various two-party key exchange designs adaptable for group key exchange protocols with multiple parties, experts face challenges in secure group interactions in a post-quantum environment due to the lack of such group protocols solutions. Addressing the necessity of secure group communication in IoTs, we proposed a GAKE protocol. This paper presents its design and implementation secure under QROM; we compared our initial findings on the âSaber-based GAKEâ with a Kyber-based GAKE implementation named âComplied Kyberâ proposed by Pablos, focusing on IoTs. Our findings show better efficiency than \"Compiled Kyber\" regarding overall communication duration, especially when involving up to 2000 participants in group communication. Furthermore, thorough investigation and calculations confirm the Saber-GAKE protocolâs interoperability with IoT contexts. The protocol has worthy computational efficiency, with execution speeds of 0.064 ms on ARM Cortex-M4 and 1.56 ms on ARM Cortex-M0 systems. The memory use is well below the allowed limits, with 50.86 KB on Cortex-M4 and 35.84 KB on Cortex-M0. The performance data validate that the Saber-GAKE protocol can effectively and safely function on IoT devices with limited resources, offering strong protection against quantum computing assaults.",

Traditional encryption techniques, while effective, face increasing challenges from advancing computing capabilities. Quantum cryptography has emerged as a promising solution to secure video transmission. In this article, we propose a novel cutting-edge Hybrid Quantum Video Encryption Framework. Our key idea is to integrate the strengths of quantum encryption and the classical video transmission paradigm to enhance the security of video transmission. By combining the proposed quantum encryption framework which uses a pseudorandom number generated key to perform a row-wise XOR operation along with the secure SSL-encrypted HTTP transmission over the internet, this framework provides a robust defense against threats. The experimental simulation conducted under the new computational integrated paradigm shows the strong encryption capability of the proposed method. The superior performance of the proposed method (ranges from 10-15% compared to the existing methods) as validated through statistical analysis, outperforms the state-of-the-art video encryption frameworks in terms of Information Entropy and Correlation Coefficient for encrypted plain images offering a significant advancement in the field of secure video transmission.",

        "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is one of the more sophisticated methods of homomorphic cryptography (HC). HC efficiently contacts the interacting parties in open IoT and light-weighted network environments. This approach is capable of analyzing encrypted data without decryption. The operations use private and public keys. Then, during the assessment or evaluation, users may access the original data. Before conducting tests or evaluations, the customer must first encrypt the data and then decrypt it. Since consumers use several main cycles for the whole operation, which creates noise and computation overheads, the growth rate of computation overheads has increased. The growing ratio of noise to computation rate can interrupt the whole system, resulting in machine instability, protection, and privacy concerns. To resolve the security and privacy issues, the proposed schemes used different hardness assumptions, such as over-integer, learning with error, ideal lattices, bootstrapping, etc. In this paper, we presents a comprehensive review of HE and its many varieties. The numerous possible applications of HE are covered at a high level in order to highlight the extent to which HE is used in the IoT and other lighted-weighted intelligent industry environments in a variety of various domains.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) dwell on Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) for message dissemination to achieve the goal of traffic safety and efficiency. VANETs achieve communication among vehicles and roadside units via wireless communication. Hence, security and privacy are significant concerns to be addressed for an effective application of secure VANETs in any ITS. Researchers have addressed these issues with trust management-based schemes or cryptography-based schemes. While these schemes can secure VANETs, they have various limitations presenting hindrances in their deployment. In this context, we have proposed a Blockchain-assisted Trust Computation with a Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication (BTC2PA) scheme for connected vehicles. The BTC2PA scheme uses a blockchain (Ethereum) assisted PKI infrastructure with digital signatures to achieve authentication for secure communication. Furthermore, it integrates a trust score computation scheme based on a reward and punishment mechanism to provide resistance against internal attacks. The feasibility and validity of the proposed BTC2PA scheme have been studied by implementation work in Rinkeby (Ethereum test network) and extensive simulations using NS-3. The results obtained show that the proposed BTC2PA scheme meets the security and privacy requirements while significantly improving the performance metrics such as communication, storage, computation cost, and end-to-end delay when compared to existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, data sharing between industrial departments is often utilized to optimize management models and improve decision-making efficiency. To enable secure data sharing, authentication between smart devices is critical. However, existing authentication schemes do not comprehensively consider data anonymity, data traceability, pseudonym management, and flexible revocation of devices, which cannot meet the needs of IIoT systems for security, real-time, and dynamicity. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-assisted lightweight authentication scheme. First, we design a lightweight authentication method based on Okamoto's protocol and elliptic curve cryptography, which achieves fast authentication of smart devices while ensuring data anonymity and traceability. Second, we design a two-level key derivation algorithm and combine it with blockchain technology to address the issue of pseudonym management. Smart devices can generate pseudonyms without requesting them from the key generation center and can be revoked flexibly. Third, security proof and analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the security objectives and is resistant to various common attacks. Finally, the performance evaluation results show that our proposed scheme performs better than the other related schemes regarding computational and communication overheads.",

        "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) has recently emerged as a new crowdsourcing service paradigm, where workers move physically to designated locations to perform tasks. Most SC systems perform task assignment based on the spatial proximity between task locations and worker locations. Under such a strategy, workers can only perform tasks near them, which may result in low social welfare (i.e., the total profit of the platform and workers). In contrast, the newly emerging strategy of competitive task assignment (CTA) stimulates workers to compete for their preferred tasks, allowing optimization of the overall profit of SC systems. Among others, one novel CTA setting is competitive detour tasking, which allows workers to compete for tasks that need them to make detours from their original travel paths. However, it requires collecting each worker's bidding profile which may expose private information. In light of this, in this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate PrivCO, a new system framework enabling privacy-preserving competitive detour tasking services in SC. PrivCO delicately bridges state-of-the-art competitive detour tasking algorithms with lightweight cryptography, providing strong protections for workers' bidding profiles. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets demonstrate that while offering strong security guarantees, PrivCO achieves social welfare comparable to the plaintext domain.",

        "abstract": "With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), more and more devices are connected to the network. Moving Target Defense (MTD) provides a security solution for many IoT network devices. However, since MTD is deployed in a packet switching network, there are problems such as packet delay and congestion. Traditional follow-up synchronization scheme is not competent for high-rate change of MTD. This poses a serious security threat to IoT devices because slow rate changes are powerless in defending against highly adversarial network attacks. In this paper, we innovatively propose an MTD synchronization method, which uses synchronization certificates to complete synchronization. Furthermore, we establish a fast switching MTD (CMTD) model based on Cryptography Fundamental Logics (CFL). It improves MTD switching rate to milliseconds and solves the problem of synchronization in high speed hopping with high covert requirements. Theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that our method effectively improves the availability and concealment of IoT devices under high-speed hopping. It is of great significance for IoT security protection under high-intensity cyber attacks.",

        "abstract": "Recently, four NIST-approved Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms are selected to be standardized. Three of them are lattice-based cryptographic schemes and feature the number-theoretic transform (NTT) as the computing bottleneck compelling fast and low-power hardware implementations. In this work, a high-speed and power-efficient NTT accelerator is presented leveraging the compute-in-memory (CIM) technique with bottom-up optimizations. Firstly, a carry-free modular multiplication (CFMM) algorithm is proposed, which utilizes on-the-fly reduction and hybrid-redundant representation to optimize the butterfly unit operation, the cornerstone of NTT. Based on the optimized algorithm, an efficient butterfly unit in memory (BUIM) is developed by co-designing with SRAM circuit, which saves the memory access energy, decreases operation cycles, and obtains ultra-short critical path. Additionally, the data pattern of CIM array is also improved to avoid redundant memory read/write operations, which further reduces memory access overhead. Finally, a combination of pipelined operation flow and constant interstage data mapping strategy is employed to bestow the proposed hybrid-redundant CIM NTT (HRCIM-NTT) architecture with minimized computing cycles and reduced routing overhead. The implementation under 45nm CMOS technology demonstrates that HRCIM-NTT achieves the highest throughput and lowest latency among the existing CIM-based NTT accelerators.",

        "abstract": "Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are emerging as the future of the automotive industry for secure, efficient and sustainable mobility. CAVs are being rapidly adapted for passenger transportation, delivery of cargo, disaster management and military reconnaissance missions. CAVs for urban transportation are in line with the evolution of âsmart cities.â However, as CAVs belong to the family of cyber-physical systems (CPS), they inherit some of the generic cyber vulnerabilities of CPS. Due to the unique features of vehicular networks, establishing secure communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) has remained a challenge for vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) service providers. The vulnerabilities associated with the multitude of sensors and internal connectivity modules increase the threat of cyber-attack on CAVs by many folds. This necessitates clear identification of the potential threats and classify them in terms of attack mechanisms. This classification will help in mapping the existing security solutions and exploration of new defense strategies for CAVs. This article has conducted a comprehensive survey of the cyber-attacks on CAVs and the ongoing research on the defense mechanisms. This work organizes the cyber-attacks based on the attacker strategies, attack surfaces, and attack vectors. The mitigation strategies are categorized based on the underlying defense approaches such as cryptography, intrusion detection, access control, and authentication in relation to their effectiveness in mitigating different attack categories. This review delves into the current challenges and explores future research directions in the domain of cybersecurity of CAVs.",

        "abstract": "Integrating cutting-edge communication technology with vehicular advancement has led to Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). VANET architecture facilitates the exchange of vital safety-related messages among vehicles. However, ensuring the authentication and integrity of shared messages over wireless links poses challenges. To resolve the issues, various batch-verifiable authentication schemes have been devised previously. However, existing VANET batch-verifiable authentication schemes utilize number theory-based cryptography, and therefore are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Additionally, storing multiple pseudonyms for anonymity incurs storage overhead on vehicles. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel lattice-based dynamic anonymous batch-verifiable authentication scheme. Being a lattice-based design, it is robust against post-quantum threats. To achieve dynamic anonymity, a fuzzy extractor design has been utilized, which removes the storage of multiple pseudonyms. The provable security has been achieved via formal analysis in the random oracle model, and an extensive performance evaluation confirms its efficiency and suitability for VANETs.",

        "abstract": "The\nN\nth-degree truncated polynomial ring units (NTRUs)-based postquantum cryptography (PQC) has drawn significant attention from the research communities, e.g., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC standardization process selected algorithm Fa st Fourier l attice-based co mpact (Falcon). Following the research trend, efficient hardware accelerator design for polynomial multiplication (an important component of the NTRU-based PQC) is crucial. Unlike the commonly used number theoretic transform (NTT) method, in this article, we have presented a novel SC hoolbook- O riginated P olynomial multiplication acc E lerators (SCOPE) design framework. Overall, we have proposed the schoolbook-based method in an innovative format to implement the targeted polynomial multiplication, first through a schoolbook-variant version and then through a Toeplitz matrix-vector product (TMVP)-based approach. Four layers of coherent and interdependent efforts have been carried out: 1) a novel lookup table (LUT)-based point-wise multiplier is proposed along with a related modular reduction technique to obtain optimal implementation; 2) a new hardware accelerator is introduced for the targeted polynomial multiplication, deploying the proposed point-wise multiplier; 3) the proposed architecture is extended to a TMVP-based polynomial multiplication accelerator; and 4) the efficiency of the proposed accelerators is demonstrated through implementation and comparison. Finally, the proposed design strategy is also extended to another NTRU-based scheme and other schoolbook-and toom-cook-based polynomial multiplications (used in other PQC), and obtains the same superior performance. We hope that the outcome of this research can impact the ongoing NIST PQC standardization process and related full-hardware implementation work for schemes like Falcon.",

        "abstract": "Recently, distributed privacy-preserving algorithms have drawn much attention in solving the economic dispatch and demand response (EDDR) problem of smart grids. However, existing privacy-preserving methods suffer from either limited protection performance (e.g., noise injection methods) or heavy computational complexity (e.g., cryptography-based methods). In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm for the EDDR problem with satisfactory privacy preservation performance as well as modest computation complexity. In particular, the proposed algorithm integrates randomness into the weight matrix and seamlessly incorporates homomorphic encryption techniques to protect privacy from both honest-but-curious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Moreover, we address computational and communication overhead concerns by utilizing a single key pair for all nodes, encrypting only a portion of information on communication links, and minimizing information exchange between neighboring nodes to only once per iteration. Besides, we analyze and prove the convergence and privacy preservation of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness by some examples, showing that the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the EDDR problem, while also providing better privacy preservation capabilities and reduced runtime compared to existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT technology has heightened the requirement for effective data management and analysis. Knowledge graphs (KGs) and large pre-trained language models (LLMs) play crucial roles in this scenario: KGs offer structured data management, while LLMs enhance data feature analysis. However, as data privacy concerns escalate, IoT machine learning models become more susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To tackle this challenge, we focus MIAs in knowledge reasoning models (KRMs) for IoT environments and propose two attack methods: correlation attack (CA) and feature aggregation attack (FAA). CA leverages the relational features of KGs to link member characteristics across different parameter spaces. It aggregates these features and maps them into a non-linear space to identify linear relationships among members, thus improving membership recognition. In contrast, the FAA focuses on aggregating multiple member features, such as confidence scores, loss values, decision labels, and so on, within the KRM and projects them into a linear space. This method captures the interactions among different features, enhancing the differentiation between member and non-member samples. The key difference is that CA explores correlations between features across member identities, while FAA aggregates various features to improve overall representation and identification. Experimental results show that both CA and FAA outperform existing methods, offering a more effective assessment of privacy risks in KRMs within IoT environments.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-place constant-geometry (CG) NTT usually has a simple and uniform memory access pattern. However, out-of-place CG NTT always requires ping-pong memory, resulting in a memory capacity requirement of 2 $N$ . Therefore, we propose a novel radix-4 in-place CG (IPCG) NTT/INTT that reduces the capacity requirement from 2 $N$ to $N$ . An area-efficient and dynamical reconfigurable polynomial multiplier (RAEPM) based on IPCG NTT is proposed to speed up polynomial multiplication over rings. In RAEPM, a Barrett modular multiplier using area-efficient radix-4 booth multiplier is designed to reduce area. In addition, an odd-bank buffer structure is proposed to achieve conflict-free memory mapping independent of polynomial length $N$ and NTT/INTT stage. Moreover, we also proposed an efficient modular reduction for specific numbers and introduced a division equivalent method to eliminate the odd number modular reduction and odd number division in addressing. RAEPM is implemented on Xilinx VC709 FPGA and runs at 294MHz clock frequency. Compared with the prior pure NTT accelerators, under the same parameters, RAEPM achieves a decrease of 39.02% $\\sim$ 57.63% in area-time complexity of equivalent LUT, and a decrease of 15.97% $\\sim$ 49.24% in area-time complexity of equivalent FF. Compared with the prior NTT-based polynomial multipliers, under the same parameters, RAEPM achieves a decrease of 35.48% $\\sim$ 90.81% in area-time complexity of equivalent LUT, and a decrease of 24.24% $\\sim$ 88.41% in area-time complexity of equivalent FF.",

        "abstract": "Location sharing, as an essential component of mobile applications, helps mobile users share location information and enhance their community connections. However, users may be reluctant to share their locations with personal privacy concerns, as anyone including location server who knows these locations can infer much sensitive information about users through analyzing these locationsâ information plus their background knowledge. Therefore, it poses a natural question for mobile location-sharing applications how to share usersâ locations without any breach of their privacy. To answer this question, in this paper we describe two practical attribute based encryption schemes served privacy-preserving mobile location-sharing applications. Our proposals are quite suitable for such a mobile application â location sharing with common interests since in our designs usersâ interests are also taken into consideration as well as location information. In particular, our two schemes have a higher performance in the sense that in our first construction both ciphertexts and private keys are of constant size simultaneously, and our second construction is an extension of the first that provides a tradeoff between ciphertext size and public key size. Therefore, the two schemes we designed in this work are quite practical in mobile applications which are often equipped with limited transmission or storage resources. Finally, we offer a formal security proof under a well-defined security model, followed by an experimental evaluation and a theoretical performance comparison.",

        "abstract": "Accountable anonymous credentials protect user privacy while holding the accountability of ill-intentioned individuals, which is a critical feature for applications such as online payments and other financial services. Existing accountable anonymous credentials rely on a public committee of trustworthy members who are assumed not to collude and are well protected to perform privacy revocation. However, this assumption is unsound in blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems because the selected committees may involve nodes with significant stakes, and public nodes serving as committee members are vulnerable against targeted attacks from high-computing power adversaries. In this paper, we propose an improved accountable anonymous credential called AccCred, allowing users and issuers to randomly select a hidden committee within a set of authenticated candidates for privacy revocation. No one except the members with corresponding private keys knows their identity, preventing proactive attacks. As a core component, we introduce the primitive of dynamic triple-hiding committees (DTHC), which achieves authentication, dynamic join/delete, random selection, and strong anonymity of committee members. As a building block of DTHC, we design a shuffle protocol to provide efficient shuffle proof of randomized public keys. We formally prove our scheme and compare its performance with previous work for demonstration of practicality.",

        "abstract": "Connected vehicular cloud computing applies cloud computing to Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which can provide road condition monitoring services for intelligent transportation systems. However, it brings new security and efficiency challenges to VANETs. Specifically, malicious vehicles may impersonate legitimate vehicles to tamper with or forge road conditions. Cloud servers are not fully trusted entities, the vehicle information, driver information, as well as road conditions uploaded to the cloud may be leaked to an unauthorized party. Moreover, small devices such as on-board units and roadside units have limited computational resources, and thus require lightweight security mechanisms. To address these challenges, this article proposes a blockchain-assisted road condition monitoring scheme with privacy-preserving. It prevents the leakage of sensitive vehicle identity with pseudonyms, protects the privacy of road conditions through encryption, identifies malicious vehicle impersonation attacks with source authentication, and distinguishes dishonest behaviors of cloud servers with blockchain supervision. Our scheme does not rely on expensive bilinear pairing operations, which significantly reduces the computational overheads. Security analysis shows that our proposal can provide unforgeability of authentication request/response, privacy of road conditions, resistance of reply attacks, anonymity of vehicle, and traceability of malicious vehicles. Performance analysis demonstrates that our work has lower computational and communication costs than other existing schemes",

        "abstract": "Due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the autonomous driving environment, traditional detection methods are ineffective in detecting complex and diverse anomalies. Additionally, existing detection methods relying on deep neural network may lack interpretability, making it challenging to infer the accuracy of the algorithms or the reasonableness of anomalies. To address these issues, this paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the physical invariant subspace. This method utilizes a Kalman Variational Autoencoder (KVAE) to learn the normal trajectory of vehicles and incorporates a subspace extraction (SSE) layer in the encoder to identify and capture discriminative subspaces relevant to the anomaly detection task in the latent space representation. The entire anomaly detection framework consists of a data preprocessing module, a KVAE with a SSE layer (SKVAE), an iteratively reweighted least squares state estimator, and an adaptive non-parametric cumulative sum anomaly detector. Firstly, the SKVAE separates spatial representation from action recognition and employs a Gaussian state space model to capture latent dynamic information in the sequential data, filtering out outliers and noise to enhance the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection. Moreover, the adaptive non-parametric cumulative sum detector automatically adjusts the detection threshold to adapt to different distributions and variations in the anomaly data. This method demonstrates perfect detection accuracy and efficiency in numerical experiments, and the proposed detection model offers interpretability of the predicted results through the physical invariant characteristics and the extracted interpretable subspaces.",

        "abstract": "In this brief, an improved and efficient Winograd-based Large Integer Multiplication using least-positive form named WLIM is proposed, which can reduce 28.61% to 33.33% of the number of multiplications compared to least-positive form direct multiplication. By exploiting the cyclic parallelism of the improved algorithm, an Efficient and Parallelism-Scalable Large Integer Multiplier architecture named EPSM is proposed, which has two levels of adjustable parallelism. EPSM is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 VC709 Board, Zynq UltraScale+ XZCU19EG Device, and Alveo U250 Card, by using Vivado. Compared with the related works, EPSM can achieve a performance improvement of 1.29Ã 20.99Ã. In terms of area efficiency, EPSM can achieve 3.54Ã 41.41Ã area-time product (ATP) improvements.",

        "abstract": "Over the recent years, with the increasing adoption of Federated Learning (FL) algorithms and growing concerns over personal data privacy, Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. Practical PPFL typically allows multiple participants to individually train their machine learning models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a privacy-preserving manner. As such, Privacy-Preserving Aggregation (PPAgg) as the key protocol in PPFL has received substantial research interest. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on PPFL, where PPAgg is adopted to provide a privacy guarantee, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the PPAgg protocols applied in FL systems. This survey reviews the PPAgg protocols proposed to address privacy and security issues in FL systems. The focus is placed on the construction of PPAgg protocols with an extensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these selected PPAgg protocols and solutions. Additionally, we discuss the open-source FL frameworks that support PPAgg. Finally, we highlight significant challenges and future research directions for applying PPAgg to FL systems and the combination of PPAgg with other technologies for further security improvement.",

        "abstract": "Traffic classification occupies a significant role in cybersecurity and network management. The widespread of encryption transmission protocols such as SSL/TLS has led to the dominance of deep learning based approaches. In cybersecurity, strong adversaries often complicate their strategies by constantly developing emerging attacks. Meanwhile, security practitioners desire to grasp the reasons for inference results. However, existing deep learning approaches lack efficient adaptation for incremental traffic types and often have less interpretability. In this paper, we propose I $^{2}$ RNN, an Incremental and Interpretable Recurrent Neural Network for encrypted traffic classification. The I $^{2}$ RNN proposes a novel propagation process to extract the sequence fingerprints from sessions with local robustness. Meanwhile, this proposal provides interpretability including time-series feature attribution and inter-class similarity portrait. Moreover, we design I $^{2}$ RNN in an incremental manner to adapt to emerging traffic types. The I $^{2}$ RNN only needs to train an additional set of parameters for the newly added traffic type rather than retraining the whole model with the entire dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our I $^{2}$ RNN can achieve remarkable performance in traffic classification, incremental learning, and model interpretability. Compared with other local interpretability methods, our I $^{2}$ RNN exhibits excellent stability, robustness, and effectiveness in the interpretation of network traffic data.",

        "abstract": "Traffic detection systems based on machine learning have been proposed to defend against cybersecurity threats, such as intrusion attacks and malware. However, they did not take the impact of network-induced phenomena into consideration, such as packet loss, retransmission, and out-of-order. These phenomena will introduce additional misclassifications in the real world. In this paper, we present ${\\sf ERNN}$ , a robust and end-to-end RNN model that is specially designed against network-induced phenomena. As its core, ${\\sf ERNN}$ is designed with a novel gating unit named as session gate that includes: (i) four types of actions to simulate common network-induced phenomena during model training; and (ii) the Mealy machine to update states of session gate that adjusts the probability distribution of network-induced phenomena. Taken together, ${\\sf ERNN}$ advances state-of-the-art by realizing the model robustness for network-induced phenomena in an error-resilient manner. We implement ${\\sf ERNN}$ and evaluate it extensively on both intrusion detection and malware detection systems. By practical evaluation with dynamic bandwidth utilization and different network topologies, we demonstrate that ${\\sf ERNN}$ can still identify 98.63% of encrypted intrusion traffic when facing about 16% abnormal packet sequences on a 10 Gbps dataplane. Similarly, ${\\sf ERNN}$ can still robustly identify more than 97% of the encrypted malware traffic in multi-user concurrency scenarios. ${\\sf ERNN}$ can realize $\\sim$ 4% accuracy more than SOTA methods. Based on the Integrated Gradients method, we interpret the gating mechanism can reduce the dependencies on local packets (termed dependency dispersion ). Moreover, we demonstrate that ${\\sf ERNN}$ possesses superior stability and scalability in terms of parameter settings and feature selection.",

        "abstract": "With the development of science and technology, human beings cannot live without electricity. The introduction of smart grid systems brings new ideas to break the shackle of existing electricity systems. This paper proposes a mechanism with data monitoring and sharing capabilities based on the consortium blockchain, realizing comprehensive monitoring of smart devices, and promoting the effective sharing of electrical data in smart grids. When a smart device is out of order, the smart contract connected to it will be triggered, and the users can check the running status through the smart phone. This approach allows nodes in the consortium blockchain to request transactions, using the prepaid payment smart contract with time-lock script to protect the consumer right of request nodes. In addition, we use a (t, n) -threshold secret sharing scheme to realize multiparty sharing of electrical data. Paillier encryption arithmetic is used to guarantee the confidentiality of messages in node transaction.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are attracting increasing attention thanks to the great mobility and flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper considers a typical UAS, which consists of a UAV, a sensing device that provides some sensed data to the UAV, and an end-user that operates the UAV. However, the information exchanged between these parties is vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, emphasizing the need to develop privacy-preserving approaches. The cryptographic methods are undoubtedly effective, but their high computational overhead may adversely impact the normal operations of UASs. Additionally, the dynamic of a UAV has a high dimension, which is disadvantageous for both estimation and encryption. Therefore, this paper proposes a secure distributed estimation protocol with partially homomorphic encryption by encrypting the transmitted measurements and estimates. Attribute to distributed structure and partial homomorphism, the computation amount for secure estimation is greatly reduced. At the same time, the raw data that needs to be encrypted is transferred into the space of plaintexts by a uniform quantizer and a mapping strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulation.",

        "abstract": "Secure Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a viable solution where clients seek secure ML computation delegation while protecting sensitive data. We propose an efficient method to securely evaluate deep standard convolutional neural networks based on residue number system variant of Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme in the manner of batch inference. In particular, we introduce a packing method called Channel-By-Channel Packing that maximizes the slot compactness and Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) capabilities in ciphertexts. We also propose a new method for homomorphic convolution evaluation called Channel-By-Channel Convolution , which minimizes the additional heavy operations during convolution layers. Simulation results show that our work has improvements in amortized runtime for inference, with a factor of 5.04 and 5.20 for ResNet-20 and ResNet-110, respectively, compared to the previous results. We note that our results almost simulate the original backbone models, with classification accuracy differing from the backbone within 0.02%p. Furthermore, we show that the client's rotation key size generated and transmitted can be reduced from 105.6GB to 6.91GB for ResNet models during an MLaaS scenario. Finally, we show that our method can be combined with previous methods, providing flexibility for selecting batch sizes for inference.",

        "abstract": "The application of Internet of Vehicles(IoV) technology has greatly improved usersâ driving experience, but it also faces some challenges: (1) the central server is not powerful enough to support the rapid growth of IoV identity authentication requests; (2) there is a privacy leakage issue during vehicle authentication. To address these issues, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme based on TRUG-PBFT (Trustworthy Roadside Unit Group) master-slave chains and zero-knowledge proof. First, to enhance authentication efficiency, we propose the TRUG-PBFT consensus algorithm. It improves the traditional PBFT by optimizing the PBFT consensus process, reducing the number of consensus nodes using fractional grouping, and selecting master node using verifiable random functions (VRF). Second, we use lattice-based zero-knowledge proof scheme to achieve anonymous authentication of vehicles, and important data in the vehicle authentication process is stored by the main chain maintained by the base station group and the slave chain maintained by the roadside unit group. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that compared to PBFT consensus, TRUG-PBFT in terms of consensus efficiency is improved by approximately 33%, and the authentication schemeâs computational cost is only 7.08ms, superior to existing authentication schemes.",

        "abstract": "The absence of an algorithm that effectively monitors the deep learning models used in side-channel attacks increases the difficulty of a security evaluation. If an attack is unsuccessful, that could be due to multiple reasons. It can be that we are indeed dealing with a resistant implementation, but it is possible that the deep learning model used is faulty. In this contribution, we formalize two conditions, persistence and patience , for a deep learning model to be optimal and we propose an early stopping algorithm that reliably recognizes the model's optimal state during training. The novelty of our solution is in an efficient implementation of guessing entropy estimation as a success metric used to measure the strength of a side-channel adversary. As a result, the model which uses our strategy for learning converges with fewer traces than other known methods.",

        "abstract": "Paging and exit overheads have been proven to be the performance bottlenecks when adopting Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) with trusted hardware such as Intel SGX for keyword search. This problem becomes more serious when incorporating ORAM and SGX to design oblivious SSE schemes such as POSUP [1] and Oblidb [2] which can defend against inference attacks. The main reason comes from high round communication complexity of ORAM and constrained trusted memory created by SGX. To overcome this performance bottleneck, we propose a set of novel SSE constructions with realistic security/performance trade-offs. Our core idea is to encode the keyword-identifier pairs into a bloom filter to reduce the number of ORAM operations during the search procedure. Specifically, Construction 1 loads the bloom filter into the enclave sequentially, which outperforms about $1.7\times$ when the dataset is large compared with the performance of the baseline that directly combines ORAM and SGX. To further improve the performance of Construction 1, Construction 2 classifies keywords into groups and stores these groups in different bloom filters. By additionally leaking the keywords in search token belonging to which groups, Construction 2 outperforms Construction 1 by $16.5\\sim 36.8\times$ and provides an improvement of at least one order over state-of-the-art oblivious protocols.",

        "abstract": "With the rising trend of digital technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality, Metaverse has gained a notable popularity. The applications that will eventually benefit from Metaverse is the telemedicine and e-health fields. However, the data and techniques used for realizing the medical side of Metaverse is vulnerable to data and class leakage attacks. Most of the existing studies focus on either of the problems through encryption techniques or addition of noise. In addition, the use of encryption techniques affects the overall performance of the medical services, which hinders its realization. In this regard, we propose Generative adversarial networks and spike learning based convolutional neural network (GASCNN) for medical images that is resilient to both the data and class leakage attacks. We first propose the GANs for generating synthetic medical images from residual networks feature maps. We then perform a transformation paradigm to convert ResNet to spike neural networks (SNN) and use spike learning technique to encrypt model weights by representing the spatial domain data into temporal axis, thus making it difficult to be reconstructed. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available MRI dataset and show that the proposed work is resilient to various data and class leakage attacks in comparison to existing state-of-the-art works (1.75x increase in FID score) with the exception of slightly decreased performance (less than 3%) from its ResNet counterpart. while achieving 52x energy efficiency gain with respect to standard ResNet architecture.",

        "abstract": "Emotions provide critical information regarding a person's health and well-being. Therefore, the ability to track emotion and patterns in emotion over time could provide new opportunities in measuring health longitudinally. This is of particular importance for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), where emotion dysregulation is a hallmark symptom of increasing mood severity. However, measuring emotions typically requires self-assessment, a willful action outside of one's daily routine. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for collecting real-world natural speech data from daily life and measuring emotions from these data. The approach combines a novel data collection pipeline and validated robust emotion recognition models. We describe a deployment of this pipeline that included parallel clinical and self-report measures of mood and selfreported measures of emotion. Finally, we present approaches to estimate clinical and self-reported mood measures using a combination of passive and self-reported emotion measures. The results demonstrate that both passive and self-reported measures of emotion contribute to our ability to accurately estimate mood symptom severity for individuals with BD.",

        "abstract": "Existing JPEG encryption approaches pose a security risk due to the difficulty in changing all block-feature values while considering format compatibility and file size expansion. To address these concerns, this paper introduces a novel JPEG image encryption scheme. First, the security of sketch information against chosen-plaintext attacks is improved by increasing the change rate of block-feature values. Second, a classification global permutation approach is designed to encrypt the undivided run/size, value (RSV)-based AC groups to achieve larger changes in the block-feature values. Third, to reduce file size expansion while maintaining format compatibility, the DC coefficients are rotated based on the mapped DC differences in the same category, and the nonzero AC coefficients are mapped in the same category. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing schemes in terms of security. Notably, the average change rate of block-feature values is increased by at least 20%. Furthermore, the proposed scheme reduces the file size by an average of 2.036% compared to existing JPEG image encryption methods.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome the constraints of security for consumer devices, authors put forward a specialized Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) framework designed specifically for enhancing security in fog communications. The approach presented in this study incorporates attribute-based fine-grained access control, which facilitates the encryption and decryption of data according to specified attribute-based criteria. This system guarantees that just authorized entities, whose characteristics satisfy the access policy, are able to access the data. Bilinear pairings and Decisional Diffie-Hellman key exchange are used as a means to enforce access regulations, therefore guaranteeing the confidentiality and security of data. The inclusion of attribute revocation procedures enables the alteration of user characteristics while preserving the integrity of data security. In order to ensure the security of data during transmission, secure communication protocols are used, while also taking into account the dynamic characteristics of fog situations by considering scalability and performance optimization. At the end, the proposed approach has undergone thorough validation procedure to verify its durability and effectiveness, making it a significant asset within the realm of fog computing security solutions. The results shows that the key generation time, encryption and decryption time of the proposed scheme is better than the existing approaches. Moreover, a mathematical comparative analysis is also done to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The speedy proliferation of cloud storage choices has prompted consumers to choose the cloud as a preferred platform for storing their collections of images. However, this trend also invokes fundamental security issues regarding image privacy and data breach scenarios. To address these issues, consumers have recently used miscellaneous traditional image encryption techniques, primarily concentrated on preventing unauthorized access to cloud-stored images to defend the privacy of the image data. Moreover, these methods prioritize privacy preservation, they often neglect the importance of maintaining the usability of the encrypted images; hence, a Thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) was newly raised to preserve the thumbnail unchanged post-encryption, thereby improving the prevailing usability of the stored image. Hence, legitimate consumers can conveniently preview and control the cipher image without decryption. PwLMÎ¼-TPE scheme greatly decreases encryption durations by approximately 17 times compared to existing methods, achieving an expansion ratio of around 2.1 for encrypted images and 1 for decrypted images, while showing SSIM and PSNR values close to 0.9 and infinity, respectively, along with an NPCR value of nearly 99%. The scheme is favourably adequate to resist cryptographic attacks and ensures usability and privacy, making it particularly suitable for cloud-based applications.",

        "abstract": "Weighted set sampling has been proven essential for generating discrete numbers based on their weights and found broad applications in recommendation systems. The extension of this method, known as weighted range set sampling (WRSS), specifies a query range and applies weighted set sampling to the data within that range. With the proliferation of cloud computing, outsourcing encrypted data and data processing tasks to cloud servers has become a common practice to overcome data storage and processing challenges while protecting data privacy. Existing studies have proposed many privacy-preserving solutions for various customized query and data processing tasks, none have specifically addressed privacy-preserving WRSS. In response to this gap, our paper introduces an efficient and privacy-preserving WRSS scheme. We begin by leveraging the three-party secret sharing (TPSS) scheme as a foundation to design an enhanced three-party secret sharing (eTPSS) scheme with superior storage and computational efficiency. Building upon the eTPSS scheme, we introduce a series of private algorithms to safeguard WRSS privacy. Our scheme integrates the use of a binary search tree and the alias method for WRSS, ensuring privacy through eTPSS-based private algorithms. A thorough security analysis under the simulation-based real/ideal worlds model showcases the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The proposed scheme's efficiency has been substantiated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that our scheme marks a significant advancement in addressing the challenges posed by privacy-preserving WRSS.",

        "abstract": "Homomorphically encrypted matrix operations are extensively used in various privacy-preserving applications. Consequently, reducing the cost of encrypted matrix operations is a crucial topic on which numerous studies have been conducted. In this paper, we introduce a novel matrix encoding method, named bicyclic encoding , under which we propose two new algorithms BMM-I and BMM-II for encrypted matrix multiplication. BMM-II outperforms the stat-of-the-art algorithms in theory, while BMM-I, combined with the segmented strategy, performs well in practice, particularly for matrices with high dimensions. Another noteworthy advantage of bicyclic encoding is that it allows for transposing an encrypted matrix entirely free. A comprehensive experimental study based on our proof-of-concept implementation shows that each algorithm introduced in this paper has specific scenarios outperforming existing algorithms, achieving speedups ranging from 2x to 38x.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes an encrypted simultaneous control system for an antagonistic pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuator to develop a cybersecure and flexible actuator. First, a simultaneous control system design is considered for the joint angle and stiffness of a PAM actuator in a model-based design approach, thus facilitating the use of an encrypted control method. The designed controller includes a contraction force model expressed as rational polynomial functions, which makes it difficult to encrypt the controller. To overcome this difficulty, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based polynomial approximation is employed for a rational controller. Then, the resulting polynomial controller is transformed into a matrix-vector product form, which enables the use of a specific homomorphic encryption scheme to develop an encrypted simultaneous control system for the PAM actuator. Finally, this study quantitatively evaluates the tracking control performance of the original, approximated, and encrypted controllers. The experimental results show that the proposed encrypted controller achieves simultaneous tracking of the joint angle and stiffness with a tracking error of less than 3.7%.",

        "abstract": "Recently, differential-neural cryptanalysis, which combines deep learning with differential cryptanalysis, has gained attention as a powerful and practical cryptanalysis method. In this approach, a neural distinguisher is trained to distinguish the target cipher with specific differential properties from other ciphers, and its statistical analysis is used to guess the key. This approach offers the advantage of enabling deep learning to analyze cryptographic properties, traditionally demanding substantial time and expertise. Nevertheless, the black-box nature of deep learning models poses challenges for cryptanalysts in comprehending the construction of the differential dataset and the neural distinguisher. In particular, since the differential dataset serves as the foundation for generating the neural distinguisher, there is a pressing need for an effective methodology to construct a high-quality differential dataset. However, the existing approaches for the generation of differential dataset is based on the well-known differential characteristic or exploring through the training neural distinguisher. In this paper, we analyzed the intrinsic property of differential dataset and proposed a novel approach to construct a good differential dataset for differential-neural cryptanalysis. First, we conducted an analysis to find the difference between well-trainable differential datasets and other differential datasets using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. As a result, the well-trainable differential dataset has a property that there are some principal components who can well express the variance of the whole dataset, the data construct clusters in the principal components-based reduced dimension. Building upon our analysis results, we proposed the exploring algorithm for the generation of well-trainable differential dataset. This proposed algorithm assesses the input differences within the differential dataset by identifying significant principal...",

        "abstract": "Spatial crowdsourcing is a distributed computing paradigm that utilizes the collective intelligence of workers to perform complex tasks. How to achieve privacy-preserving task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing applications has been a popular research area. However, most of the existing task assignment schemes may reveal private and sensitive information of tasks or workers. Few schemes can support task assignment based on different attributes simultaneously, such as spatial, interest, etc. To study the above themes, in this paper, we propose one privacy-preserving task assignment scheme with multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications (TAMT). Specifically, we first define Euclidean distance-based location search and Hamming distance-based interest search, which map the demands of the tasks and the interests of the workers into the binary vectors. Second, we deploy PKD-tree to index the task data leveraging the pivoting techniques and the triangular inequality of Euclidean distance, and propose an efficient multi-threshold range search algorithm based on matrix encryption and decomposition technology. Furthermore, based on DT-PKC, we introduce a ciphertext-based secure comparison protocol to support multi-threshold range search for spatial crowdsourcing applications. Finally, comprehensive security analysis proves that our proposed TAMT is privacy-preserving. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that TAMT is practical and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Energy trading in distributed microgrids represents an effective means of enhancing the utilization of renewable energy. However, the aggregation of large-scale consumption data may encounter business scalability issues and potential privacy exposure concerns, necessitating the development of novel secure and scalable frameworks for integrating consumption demands between prosumer and microgrid entities. we research focuses on providing a user-friendly transaction model for consumers and microgrid operators. Firstly, a privacy aggregation scheme for user resource requests is designed to ensure the security and decentralization of user data. In addition, the model employs a bidirectional heterogeneous resource allocation mechanism to support the optimal allocation of multiple resources, such as renewable energy, power assets, energy storage devices, and carbon credits, among different microgrids. Finally, a microgrid transaction prototype has been constructed on the Truffle development framework. In this context, smart contracts has been designed to ensure that the transactions are carried out automatically. Experimental results indicate that the scheme provides enhanced security for multi-resource trading in a cluster context relative to existing methodologies. The number of transactions increases linearly with the resource overhead, resulting in more efficient utilization of energy trading. Furthermore, the frameworkâs scalability has been demonstrated through both temporal and spatial considerations.",

        "abstract": "With the biennial doubling of the number of transistors in a given area of silicon, contemporary integrated circuits (IC) are forging more and more often and will continue to forge complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Their equally complex manufacturing and in-system tests are now carried out through top-level test data delivery nets that enable fast streaming of test data to, from, and throughout a chip. However, it is essential to apply restrictions mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and usage of SoCs as well as to protect the test infrastructure against hardware security threats, and thus to prevent leakage of secret information or other sensitive assets while tests are carried out. Existing security IP cores raise concerns related to their complexity in terms of area footprint, performance, power, impact on an SoC integration flow, and testability. This paper presents simple and lightweight, yet effective and scalable, test data stream ciphers (SCs) that can be used to encrypt and decrypt test data employed in tests of SoCs and delivered via Streaming Scan Network (SSN) â a new packetized test data network. A single cipher is comprised of three Galois nonlinear feedback shift registers working in tandem to yield a large number of parallel, cryptographically secure pseudorandom keystreams. A comprehensive evaluation, including NIST statistical test suits, show high efficiency of the proposed ciphers, and is reported herein.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology, e-voting has been widely used in all aspects of peopleâs lives. However, there is a common problem in the vast majority of e-voting solutions: the inability to complete vote counting without a trusted third-party organization, which may lead to security risks. When designing an e-voting system, ensuring the trustworthiness of the voting results as well as protecting the privacy of the voters are always the most important issues. To address this challenge, we propose ISE-Voting, an Improved Secure and Efficient (ISE) evoting scheme for blockchain-assisted IoT devices. Our proposed ISE-Voting achieves voter privacy anonymity, distributed vote counting, and public verifiability of counting results in e-voting systems by using secret-sharing and identity-based ring signatures in the blockchain system. In addition, we introduce a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), which is used to share the computational pressure of the system and assist ISE-Voting to complete the final counting. According to the experimental analysis and results, our scheme is not only able to meet the basic security goals of satisfying correctness, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability, and provide 128-bit identity security for the voters in the post-quantum environment. Moreover, it can complete the distributed counting of votersâ ballots within an effective time, which provides a feasible solution for future e-voting systems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider evolving 2-threshold secret sharing schemes. In such schemes, the number of participants grows over time and is potentially unbounded, any two participants reconstruct the secret, and no single participant can figure out any partial information about it. They are referred to as (2,â)-threshold secret sharing schemes. The cost of a (2,â)-threshold secret sharing scheme can be measured as the maximum, over all possible n â¥ 2, of the ratio between the sum of the lengths of the shares for the first n participants and the sum of the lengths of the shares for a (standard) optimal (2, n )-threshold secret sharing scheme. It is known that such a cost measure is lower bounded by 3/2. Moreover, currently, the best known (2,â)-threshold secret sharing scheme has cost 1.59375. Our contribution improves the state-of-the-art in several ways: â¢ We describe a new (2,â)-threshold secret sharing scheme whose cost is 1.5859375, improving on the previous best known scheme. â¢ Motivated by the fact that in some applications one knows a lower bound on the number of participants, we generalize the cost measure, by considering the maximum over all possible n â¥ z 0 , where z 0 is any integer greater than or equal to 2. â¢ We provide constructions of optimal schemes for the generalized cost measure and through a theoretical analysis we prove some interesting properties for the lower bound of the cost. â¢ By using algorithmic techniques, for reasonably small cases, we exhaustively study the problem of finding tight lower bounds. In particular, we obtain a lower bound of 1.534375, improving the lower bound of 3/2. We close the paper summarizing our findings and discussing some open issues.",

        "abstract": "Intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) based fault injection is a hardware security threat that noninvasively generates temporary faults by causing a glitch in the clock supplied to a cryptographic module. Previous discussions of this threat have assumed that the glitch is supplied directly to the cryptographic module and that modules with clocks supplied by a phase-locked loop (PLL) are immune to this threat. However, for PLLs in general-purpose devices, which are required to output a stable clock frequency over a wide frequency bandwidth, a glitch may cause steep frequency fluctuations in the output clock. If these fluctuations exceed the maximum operating frequency of the module, a fault due to a timing violation caused by a PLL compromised with IEMI will occur. This article investigates the possibility of IEMI fault injection in cryptographic modules operated by a clock output from PLLs with wide-loop bandwidths implemented in general-purpose devices. Specifically, we focus on the phase comparison of the clock by the PLL and inject EM waves to temporarily increase the output clock frequency by controlling the occurrence time of the clock glitch. In experiments, we applied IEMI fault injection to a PLL implemented in a field-programmable gate array and demonstrated that it is possible to cause a fault due to a timing violation, leading to the extraction of the secret key. In addition, as a countermeasure against this threat, a method to suppress PLL output frequency fluctuations due to glitches was investigated.",

        "abstract": "GIFT, as a lightweight block cipher algorithm, is mainly suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as the Internet of Things, to achieve efficient cryptographic communication. For the diffusion characteristics of round function of GIFT algorithm, this paper proposes two byte-based differential fault attack models. Theoretically, the first and second models require 53.44 and 12.42 byte faults to recover the master key. Experimental results show that the first and second models require about 79 and 16 byte faults, respectively, to recover the master key. The models proposed in this paper have made significant breakthroughs in terms of both the attack range and the number of required faults, which provide important guidance for algorithmic security research and the design of fault-tolerant mechanisms for IoT devices.",

        "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Things (IoT) marks a considerable advancement in data collection and utilization across various sectors. In the realm of complex scenarios, dance-consumer electronics (DCE) employ this technology to provide detailed and trustworthy documentation and three-dimensional digital capture of dancersâ movements. However, the handling of sensitive physiological data poses significant security and trustworthiness risks in such consumer electronics, including potential breaches that could be exploited for location tracking and behavior prediction. To address the challenges of encrypted traffic detection and the need for trustworthiness in IoT, this paper introduces the AI-Enhanced Anonymous Traffic Filtering Framework, which features terminal anonymization. This framework employs the Inception-SelfAttBiGRU model to filter malicious traffic and includes a credibility-based filtering mechanism prior to this module to reduce network load and enhance system efficiency for those consumer electronics. The evaluation concentrated on two main areas: assessing the access credibility-based filtering mechanismâs ability to identify and block malicious DCE endpoints and evaluating the effectiveness of the encrypted traffic classification technique. Using simulated environments and public datasets, this comprehensive assessment demonstrated that the dual-layer protection mechanism effectively detects and blocks malicious traffic, thereby enhancing system security and maintaining network integrity.",

        "abstract": "With the surge in various types of network traffic and the widespread application of encryption technology, the classification of encrypted traffic plays an increasingly important role in ensuring network security, enhancing quality of service, and managing network traffic. However, most existing methods often suffer from issues such as excessive reliance on manual feature extraction and expert knowledge, unstable classification performance, and lack of transfer learning capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a high-performance hybrid encrypted traffic classification framework, FERNN-AC. It directly extracts features from raw traffic and fully explores and utilizes the spatiotemporal information of traffic data by integrating specially designed feature enhancement module and temporal feature extraction module in a reasonable manner. It introduces angle constraints and can be combined with metalearning, thereby improving classification performance while possessing certain transfer learning capabilities. The experiments are conducted on three datasets, and the results shows that compare with relevant baseline methods, FERNN-AC has excellent and stable classification performance",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of cloud computing has spurred the popularity of storing and querying databases in the cloud. Among others, skyline queries play an important role in the database field due to its usefulness in multi-criteria decision support systems. To accommodate the tailored needs of users, user-defined skyline query has recently emerged, allowing users to define custom preferences in their skyline queries. However, user-defined skyline query services, if deployed in the cloud, may raise critical privacy concerns as the outsourced databases and skyline queries may contain proprietary/privacy-sensitive information. In light of the above, this paper presents ObliuSky, a new solution enabling oblivious user-defined skyline query processing in the cloud. ObliuSky departs from prior work by not only providing confidentiality protection for the content of the outsourced database, the user-defined skyline queries, and the query results, but also hiding the data patterns (e.g., user-defined dominance relations among database points and search access patterns) which may indirectly cause data leakages. We formally analyze the security guarantees and conduct extensive performance evaluations. The results show that while achieving much stronger security guarantees than the state-of-the-art prior work, ObliuSky is superior in database and query encryption efficiency, and scalable in oblivious query processing.",

        "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is a technique that enables secure outsourcing of data to an untrusted cloud server without sacrificing search functionality. Recently, multi-user SSE schemes for data sharing, which support access control from various users, have gained attention. However, the access control mechanisms in existing schemes are not adequate for realistic data-sharing scenarios as they do not consider time constraints or only partially address them, making these mechanisms unsuitable for SSE schemes. To address this issue, we first highlight the importance of time constraints in multi-user SSE and propose a completely time-constrained SSE scheme under a two-server model. By taking advantage of the Lagrange interpolation and pre-computation, our proposed scheme enables searching over time-related encrypted data with owner-enforced time constraints. Additionally, we employ the blinding technique with the assistance of a semi-honest time server to ensure the completeness of time constraints, which is not guaranteed in existing works. Based on the leakage function, we prove the security of our proposed scheme in the simulation-based security model. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality of our scheme in supporting time-constrained functions.",

        "abstract": "6G Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Network (STIN) extends connectivity services globally, attracting an increasing number of users to access the Internet with its advantages of wide coverage, high speed, and large capacity. However, the complex communication environments, such as link exposure and high dynamics of satellites in the network, pose challenges to designing authentication schemes that are applicable to 6G STIN. Although researchers have proposed many authentication schemes for 6G STIN, most of them have only focused on access authentication, which cannot guarantee the stability of subsequent communications. A few schemes have considered providing seamless services through handover authentication, but they still face issues such as security vulnerabilities and high energy consumption. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes an energy efficient authentication scheme for 6G STIN, capable of achieving mutual authentication between entities and negotiating a secure session key. Additionally, it designs a handover mechanism that is more suitable for 6G STIN and supports handover authentication for multiple users. Through security analysis, our scheme is proven to withstand various attacks, and its security is further verified using the ProVerif tool. Performance analysis shows that our scheme has lower authentication latency and communication overhead, while reducing energy consumption and ensuring security.",

        "abstract": "The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Everything (IoE) has revolutionized the way we connect and interact with technology, introducing unprecedented convenience and functionality. However, adopting this also exposes significant vulnerabilities, as traditional authentication methods like AES and Triple-DES often incur high computational overhead and struggle to adapt to the diverse array of devices within IoT and IoE environments. This paper introduces the Network Efficient Hierarchical Authentication - NEHA Algorithm, a novel encryption method designed to address these challenges by offering a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for secure communication. The algorithm outperforms traditional encryption algorithms by excelling in scalability, handling large datasets efficiently through its hierarchical encryption framework. Its dynamic key derivation method, based on device-specific MAC addresses, ensures adaptability to a wide range of devices and environments. The algorithmâs unique 140-bit encryption format secures high-volume data transfers without compromising performance. By dividing data into 42-bit blocks, it optimizes the encryption process, offering faster, more efficient data protection than conventional approaches. Adding to that is the advanced block reordering techniques and circular right shift operations further enhance security while minimizing computational overhead, making the proposed algorithm ideal for resource-constrained IoT environments. Our research demonstrates that NEHA provides higher efficiency, lower latency, and better resource utilization compared to AES, Triple-DES, and similar algorithms, making it a superior choice for the evolving demands of IoT and IoE networks. By integrating innovative encryption techniques with seamless compatibility across existing systems, NEHA offers a future-proof, scalable solution that meets the stringent security requirements of modern network environments.",

        "abstract": "Organizations these days capitalize on crowdsourcing to learn collective wisdom from a population of individuals. Vast amounts of data have been gathered, making the crowdsourcing platforms a lucrative target to steal data from and thus raising severe privacy concerns. Data contributed by workers may carry sensitive individual information. Meanwhile, organizations deem the aggregate statistics as intellectual property. In this paper, we propose, design, and evaluate GoCrowd, a system framework for obliviously aggregating wisdom with quality assurance in crowdsourcing. At its core, we propose constructions for two procedures. The starting point is a gold-standard based private worker quality control procedure that provides privacy-friendly worker quality assurance under the widely popular gold-standard mechanism. The subsequent procedure is an oblivious wisdom aggregation procedure that obliviously learns aggregate statistics over workers' data while considering their quality. We securely realize these procedures with only lightweight secret sharing techniques. Our system is utterly oblivious to the service provider, and ensures that only the requester can learn the aggregate quality-aware statistics but nothing more. Extensive evaluations show that GoCrowd can produce quality statistics over data from 500 workers for 200 16-choice questions within 1 s.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces significant challenges related to secure authentication, efficient communication, and privacy preservation due to the high mobility of vehicles, the need for real-time data processing, varying quality of communication links, and the diverse range of devices and protocols requiring interoperability. These challenges are further complicated by the large-scale, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of IoV systems. Traditional approaches using Road Side Connecting Nodes (RSCNs) face challenges like limited range, high costs, and single points of failure. Drone-assisted IoV (DIoV) networks address these issues by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile edge nodes, enhancing connectivity, extending coverage, and improving adaptability and resilience. To address these challenges, we propose SECURE, a drone-assisted, Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication and privacy-preserving protocol integrated with edge computing. This architecture replaces RSCNs with edge nodes and incorporates UAVs as mobile edge nodes, providing extended coverage, reduced latency, and enhanced adaptability. The PUFs in SECURE generate unique hardware-based cryptographic keys, adding an additional layer of security, while edge computing offloads computational tasks, improves network efficiency, and further reduces latency. The formal security analysis, conducted using the Random Oracle Model (ROM), proves the robustness of the session key against active and passive adversaries. Furthermore, informal security analysis demonstrates that SECURE effectively resists various security attacks, while achieving confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in DIoV. In SECURE, we have considered two types of devices for experiments: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Raspberry Pi 4. The performance analysis, considering the results from Jetson Xavier NX, demonstrates that SECURE achieves maximum upto approximately 82.1% less communication cost and 78% faster c...",

        "abstract": "Users are inclined to outsource their data to the cloud due to the rapid growth of data in response to the growing use of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the primary issues for users is the secure sharing of personal data. Access control and fine-grained sharing of encrypted data can be accomplished with attribute-based encryption (ABE). However, the computational cost required for ABE decryption hinders its widespread deployment on lightweight devices. For lightweight mobile devices, outsourcing computation is a highly attractive technical that outsources heavy decryption tasks to the cloud. The majority of current outsourced ABE schemes, however, only verify whether the cloud returns the correct decryption result, and lack a mechanism to prevent mobile devices from maliciously accusing the cloud of returning incorrect results, and overlook fairness between mobile devices and the cloud. Furthermore, the increasing number of encrypted files stored in the cloud will impede efficient query processing. Moreover, attribute revocation and privacy protection are also crucial. Therefore, this paper proposes Fair and Exculpable Attribute-Based Searchable Encryption with Revocation and Verifiable Outsourced Decryption (FE-ABSE-RV) Using Smart Contract, and constructs a concrete FE-ABSE-RV scheme. The scheme is capable of withstanding chosen plaintext attack and chosen keyword attack according to security analysis. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments illustrate that the FE-ABSE-RV scheme is more expressive, efficient, and practical.",

        "abstract": "To balance data confidentiality and availability, order-revealing encryption (ORE) has emerged as a pivotal primitive facilitating range queries on encrypted data. However, challenges arise in diverse user domains where data is encrypted with different keys, giving rise to the development of delegatable order-revealing encryption (DORE) schemes. Regrettably, existing DORE schemes are susceptible to authorization token forgery attacks and rely on computationally intensive bilinear pairings. This work proposes a novel solution to address these challenges. We first introduce a delegatable equality-revealing encryption scheme, enabling the comparison of ciphertexts encrypted by distinct secret keys through authorization tokens. Building upon this, we present a delegatable order-revealing encryption that leverages bitwise encryption. DORE supports efficient multiuser ciphertext comparison while robustly resisting authorization token forgery attacks. Significantly, our approach distinguishes itself by minimizing bilinear pairings. Experimental results highlight the efficacy of DORE, showcasing a notable speedup of 2.8Ã in encryption performance and 1.33Ã in comparison performance compared to previous DORE schemes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "To achieve fine-grained access control and address the data silos challenge in data sharing, the integration of blockchain with attribute-based encryption emerges as a promising solution. Nowadays, the growing interconnectedness among diverse blockchain applications has spurred the need for efficient cross-chain data sharing. However, existing single-authority attribute-based data sharing schemes are not suitable for such cross-chain scenarios involving multiple attribute authorities. Moreover, the frequent requirement for data owners to process cross-chain data requests significantly hampers practicality. In this context, we introduce a novel multi-authority attribute-based proxy re-encryption scheme that enables ciphertext policy updating and supports secure and efficient cross-chain data sharing. By introducing a proxy, the data owner is empowered to delegate access without leaking any valid information and flexibly sells data across blockchains through cross-chain access policies. Besides, our scheme leverages the relay chain to foster a decentralized and trustworthy ecosystem. The adoption of smart contracts automates the cross-chain data sharing process and ensures equitable distribution of benefits among participants. Additionally, our scheme integrates hybrid encryption with the decentralized data hosting platform, substantially mitigating the on-chain storage burden. Security analysis affirms that our scheme is semantically secure and resistant to collusion attack. Performance analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate the excellent efficiency and practicality of our scheme when conducting cross-chain data sharing.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a multi-grained reconfigurable cryptographic accelerator 2.0 (MRCA 2.0), upgrading from the first 8/32/64-bit CGRA named MRCA, to offer high performance with a smaller area and lower power consumption for blockchain-based IoT systems. To achieve these goals, we propose four innovative ideas: a dual processing element array (D-PEA) with reduced memories, a synchronous row connection and processing element (PE) architecture, a concatenable crypto ALU, and heterogeneous PEs. Our MRCA 2.0 has been successfully implemented on the TySOM-3A FPGA platform across 19 different algorithms. Our ASIC experiment on 45nm CMOS technology shows that MRCA 2.0 reduces area and power consumption by 1.6 and 1.4 times, respectively, compared to the previous MRCA. Compared to related works, MRCA 2.0 outperforms in throughput by 1.63-28.3 times and in energy efficiency by 1.6-3.4 times, while also offering better flexibility in supporting more 64-bit algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of smart consumer devices has given rise to the consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), enabling immense data collection and valuable insights for enhancing con-sumer experiences. However, the distributed nature of CIoT sys-tems and the sensitivity of consumer data pose significant chal-lenges in ensuring security, privacy, and zero trust. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating robust federated learning with a main-side blockchain architecture and zero trust principles to enable secure and privacy-preserving data sharing and collabo-rative learning in CIoT environments. The proposed system model consists of CIoT devices as side nodes, edge servers as main nodes, and a cloud server for global aggregation. A lightweight privacy-preserving aggregation protocol is designed based on secret shar-ing to protect raw data during local model updates. To enhance the robustness against Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, a resampling-based robust aggregation method is developed, which evaluates the cosine similarity of local updates against a ref-erence gradient securely selected via the main-side blockchain. Ex-periments demonstrate that the proposed framework performs well regarding model accuracy, convergence speed, and resiliency compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Modular multiplication is a fundamental operation in many cryptographic systems, with its efficiency playing a crucial role in the overall performance of these systems. Since many cryptographic systems operate with a fixed modulus, we propose an enhancement to the fixed modulus lookup table (LuT) method used for modular reduction, which we refer to as the manipulated LuT (MLuT) method. Our approach applies to any modulus and has demonstrated comparable performance compared with some specialized reduction algorithms designed for specific moduli. The strength of our proposed method in terms of circuit performance is shown by implementing it on Virtex7 and Virtex Ultrascale+ FPGA as the LUT-based MLuT modular multiplier (LUT-MLuTMM) with generalized parallel counters (GPCs) used in the summation step. In one-stage implementations, our proposed method achieves up to a 90% reduction in area and a 50% reduction in latency compared with the generic LuT method. In multistage implementations, our approach offers the best area-interleaved time product, with improvements of 39%, 13%, and 29% over the current state-of-the-art for $\\sim$ 256-bit, SIKE434, and BLS12-381 modular multipliers, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of our method for high-performance cryptographic accelerators employing a fixed modulus.",

        "abstract": "The Industrialindustrial IoT (IIoT) is an important cornerstone to realize the fourth industrial revolution. Data sharing is one of the key elements of IIoT, and cloud-edge-device technology is a new paradigm for achieving data sharing. In multi-user scenarios of IIoT, guaranteeing data privacy and granting fine-grained access control over data for senders and receivers is important. Matchmaking attribute-based encryption (MABE) can solve the above issues. However, current MABE schemes have a fatal problem: they ignore the malicious behaviors of data owners. In particular, there are three malicious behaviors: 1) Malicious data owners encrypt data with a pernicious way. 2) Malicious data owners release improper data. 3) A malicious data owner does not encrypt the ciphertext with the claimed access structure and attributes. Moreover, current MABE schemes require large computations, which are not suitable forto resource-constrained IIoT. Hence, this paper proposes an attribute-based bilateral access control with trust management and sanitization for IIoT called TS-MABE. For the first malicious behavior, TS-MABE uses sanitization to re-randomize ciphertexts, destroying ciphertexts encrypted in a pernicious way to make them lose information. For other malicious behaviors, TS-MABE uses trust management to evaluate the data owner based on the data userâs evaluation of the ciphertext. If a data owner publishes improper data, data users make poor evaluations due to low data quality. If a data owner does not embed the claimed access structure or attributes into the ciphertext, data users cannot actually complete the decryption or match and make poor evaluations. Data owners are afraid of being punished for low trust values, so that they dare not make malicious behaviors. Through analysis, TS-MABE is safe and efficient, suitable for IIoT.",

        "abstract": "Reversible data hiding in encrypted image (RDHEI) is a powerful security technology that aims to hide data into the encrypted image without any distortions of data extraction and image recovery. Most existing RDHEI methods using vacated room-based data embedding algorithms face challenges in improving embedding capacity and security. In this paper, we develop a novel data hiding strategy via fusion based on reservoir computing (RC) system, upon which a new RDHEI scheme is further proposed. In the proposed scheme, the original image is first encrypted by the stream cipher-based encryption algorithm using the secret keys generated by an optical chaotic system. Then, by means of the RC system, the generated encrypted image can be fused with the secret data to produce the final masked image. Unlike the existing data embedding algorithms based on vacating rooms, the RC-based fusion strategy allows for hiding secret data comparable to the volume of the cover image into the encrypted image so that a higher embedding capacity can be greatly afforded. Moreover, the proposed strategy involves a chaotic transformation via the reservoir of RC system during data hiding, producing a masked image that is completely different from the encrypted image, thus the security is greatly enhanced. Experimental results show the contributions in improving the embedding capacity and security, and also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to some existing RDHEI methods.",

        "abstract": "We consider the federated submodel learning (FSL) problem in a distributed storage system. In the FSL framework, the full learning model at the server side is divided into multiple submodels such that each selected client needs to download only the required submodel(s) and upload the corresponding update(s) in accordance with its local training data. The server comprises multiple independent databases and the full model is stored across these databases. A fundamental problem in FSL is to enable these multiple databases at the parameter server to collectively maintain a consistent view of the global parameters to facilitate parallel computing across distributed clients. In addition, a practically implementable FSL scheme should possess high throughput, efficient performance, fault tolerance, sufficient privacy, adequate security, certifiable stability, elastic scalability and easy usability features. To specifically resolve the fault tolerance and adequate security issues together, we propose a novel coding mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), which is a synthesis of ramp secret sharing and secure regenerating code. This coding technique matches FSL perfectly, as the system performance can be further improved when the full model is stored using RSRC in a distributed manner. By incorporating and extending available techniques cleverly, our new RSRC-based distributed FSL approach that is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which uses private set union (PSU), achieves all of the aforementioned important features. A complete one-round FSL process consists of: 1) an FSL-PSU phase where the union of the submodel indices to be updated by the selected clients in the current round is determined, 2) an FSL-write phase where the updated submodels are written back to the databases, and 3) additional auxiliary phases where sufficient amounts of necessary common randomness are generated at both server and client sides.",

        "abstract": "Mobile apps have significantly transformed various aspects of modern life, leading to growing concerns about privacy risks. Despite widespread encrypted communication, app fingerprinting (AF) attacks threaten user privacy substantially. However, existing AF attacks, when targeted at wireless traffic, face four fundamental challenges, namely 1) sample inseparability; 2) app multiplexing; 3) signal attenuation; and 4) open-world recognition. In this paper, we advance a novel AF attack, dubbed, to recognize app user activities over the air in an open-world setting. We introduce two novel models, i.e., sequential XGBoost and hierarchical bag-of-words model, to tackle sample inseparability and enhance robustness against noise packets arising from app multiplexing. We also propose the environment-aware model enhancement to bolster âs robustness in handling packet loss at the sniffer caused by signal attenuation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed attack in a series of challenging scenarios, including 1) open-world setting; 2) simultaneous use of different apps; 3) severe packet loss at the sniffer; and 4) cross-dataset recognition. The experimental results show that can accurately recognize app user activities. It achieves the average F1-score 0.947 for open-world app recognition and the average F1-score 0.959 for in-app user action recognition.",

        "abstract": "We describe a new family of unimodular almost two-valued periodic Golay sequence pairs of length p , where p is an odd prime. The sequences are obtained from the Legendre symbol by replacing the letters 0, 1,-1 with the letters 1, A , B Ïµ C,| A | = | B | = 1 where B additionally satisfies an appropriate constraint. The family is infinite in that each value of A yields at least one Golay pair or an ideal sequence. In special cases the family includes: (1) sequences with A = 1, or B = Â±Ä, or B = Â± i Ä or where both A and B are Gaussian rationals, or roots of unity, and (2), sequences whose autocorrelation sidelobes approach zero as p approaches infinity. These results extend the results of BjÃ¶rck on two-valued/almost two-valued ideal sequences derived from cyclic p -roots and the results of Golomb on two-valued ideal sequences derived from HadamardâPaley difference sets. Related, but in some ways more constrained results on two-valued Golay sequence pairs derived from difference set families were recently published by Li et al .",

        "abstract": "Sealed-bid auction is a common mechanism for selling and buying commodities. However, existing auction schemes to protect bids require at least squared computation and communication complexity for the bidders or rely on trusted auctioneers or third parties. To address the above problems, we propose a secure and efficient sealed-bid auction framework, called FACT. We design a lightweight threshold fully homomorphic encryption scheme as the building block. Our framework does not rely on any trusted auctioneer and fulfills a stronger security guarantee, called full privacy, i.e., only the seller and the winning bidder can determine the auction result. While our framework applies to first-price sealed-bid, it can easily be extended to support secondprice sealed-bid (i.e., Vickrey auction) with the same security guaranteed. Our framework also supports the dynamic joining and exiting of sellers and bidders. Meanwhile, our framework reduces the bidders' overhead and the number of interactions to a constant level. We formally prove the security of our framework in the semi-honest adversary model. We implement FACT and run experiments comparing its performance against existing schemes. We find that our framework not only achieves a stronger security guarantee but also shows significant performance improvement compared to existing schemes.",

        "abstract": "As a big data analysis technique, hierarchical clustering is helpful in summarizing data since it returns the clusters of the data and their clustering history. Cloud computing is the most suitable option to efficiently perform hierarchical clustering over numerous data. However, since compromised cloud service providers can cause serious privacy problems by revealing data, it is necessary to solve the problems prior to using the external cloud service. Privacy-preserving hierarchical clustering protocol in an outsourced computing environment has never been proposed in existing works. Existing protocols have several problems that limit the number of participating data owners or disclose the information of data. In this paper, we propose a parallelly running and privacy-preserving agglomerative hierarchical clustering (ppAHC) over the union of datasets of multiple parties in an outsourced computing environment, which is the first protocol to the best of our knowledge. The proposed ppAHC does not disclose any information about input and output, including the data access patterns. The proposed ppAHC is highly efficient and suitable for big data analysis to handle numerous data since its cost for one round is independent of the amount of data. It allows data owners without sufficient computing capability to participate in a collaborative hierarchical clustering.",

        "abstract": "Multisource Private Label Propagation (MPLP) is designed for different organizations to collaboratively predict labels of unlabeled nodes through iterative propagation and label updates without revealing sensitive information. Aside from the privacy of the origin data, in some statistical prediction services, it is only needed to learn about the statistical results and concrete prediction results for the abnormal nodes. To do it, we first design a basic MPLP scheme, PriLP , to meet the requirements of the privacy of origin data and the concrete prediction of normal nodes. However, our basic achievement of PriLP relies heavily on Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) due to the sparse graph representation in label propagation. To diminish reliance on AHE, our optimization facilitates data encryption in a more compact representation, resulting in encryption times that scale linearly with the number of graph nodes. Our experiments show PriLP closely matches plain-label propagation within $\\le 0.7\\%$ difference in accuracy, and the optimizations lead to up to $22.63\times$ faster execution and $1.83\times$ less communication than the basic implement.",

        "abstract": "Smart devices, especially Internet-connected devices, typically incorporate security protocols and cryptographic algorithms to ensure the control flow integrity and information security. However, various types of attacks try to tamper with these devices, including invasive and non-invasive. Chip-level shields have been proven effective against invasive attacks, but the potential of shields as a protection mechanism against side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a shield-based multi-functional protection scheme, named, capable of simultaneously thwarting invasive and non-invasive attacks. is implemented using the chipâs top metal layer and includes an Information Leakage Obfuscation Module (ILOM) underneath. This module generates its protection patterns based on the operating conditions of the circuit that need to be protected, thus reducing the correlation between electromagnetic (EM) emanations and cryptographic data. Additionally, we introduce a simulation technique to test the protection efficacy of at the layout level, utilizing commercial Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and the EMSim/EMSim $+$ tool. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the ILOM decreases the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio to below $0.6$ and improves the difficulty of SCA attacks by more than $100$ times. Compared to existing single-function protection methods against physical attacks, leverages the EM protection potential of shields to offer multi-functional protection.",

        "abstract": "With the development of digital twin (DT) technology, the DT network (DTN) has emerged to represent virtually the physical network by building physical entities as interactive DT models. However, the DTN faces the challenge of privacy leakage due to the collection of private data in the DT model building process. Additionally, massive data uploaded to the DTN for centralized processing leads to security issues of single-point failure and poisoning attacks. In this article, we propose blockchain- enabled secure federated learning (FL) for constructing a decentralized and privacy-preserving DTN. Specifically, we utilize the FL paradigm and homomorphic encryption method to locally build DT models at the ciphertext level. Then, we propose integrating blockchain into FL to construct a decentralized architecture for the DTN to avoid single-point failure. Moreover, we devise the proof-of-gradient consensus mechanism to facilitate trusted interactions among DT models to resist poisoning attacks. Finally, the security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes.",

        "abstract": "The popularity of smart homes has been facilitated by the development of information and communication technology and wireless sensors. These technologies allow users to remotely control smart devices in their homes. However, smart home communication primarily relies on the Internet, which exposes smart home networks to multiple security risks, such as smart device capture, simulation attacks, and internal privilege attacks. These threats could result in illegal users stealing data transmitted by smart devices, thereby violating usersâ privacy and security. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel revocable biometric authentication scheme based on secret sharing technology for secure remote user authentication in smart home environments. This solution introduces secret sharing technology to protect usersâ revocable biometric templates and enhances the security of user privacy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we conducted experimental verification, including measuring the equal error rate (EER), unlinkability, and revocability. The experimental results demonstrate that this solution can effectively protect the security of user biometric information while maintaining high authentication accuracy. Additionally, it has good revocability and unlinkability, which helps to improve the security and safety of smart homes without compromising user experience.",

        "abstract": "Securing cryptographic hardware designs and software implementations against side-channel attacks that leverage the power consumption or electromagnetic emanations of a device is an active topic of research. Different countermeasures against these attacks have been published, many of which rely on masking where sensitive information is split into multiple shares. Here, the information is hidden in higher statistical moments of the leakage if processed at the same time (univariate) or in combinations of side-channel information from different points in time (multivariate) if processed sequentially. Test Vector Leakage Assessment (TVLA) is a common evaluation technique to address the growing number of specific attacks. However, the assessment of multivariate leakage requires the evaluation of all possible combinations of sample points, massively slowing down the evaluation and in turn the development of countermeasures due to computational complexity.\nIn this work, we develop and compare techniques to determine clock cycle combinations that leak information in a multivariate setting. We develop an efficient multivariate assessment framework and show how this approach can be used to generate evaluation results that satisfy a desired confidence level. Eventually, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach by applying it to two masked implementations of block ciphers.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing scale and complexity of online activities, accountability, as an after-the-fact mechanism, has become an effective complementary approach to ensure system security. Decades of research have delved into the connotation of accountability. They fail, however, to achieve practical accountability of decryption. This paper seeks to address this gap. We consider the scenario where a client (called encryptor, her) encrypts her data and then chooses a delegate (a.k.a. decryptor, him) that stores data for her. If the decryptor initiates an illegitimate decryption on the encrypted data, there is a non-negligible probability that this behavior will be detected, thereby holding the decryptor accountable for his decryption. We make three contributions. First, we review key definitions of accountability known so far. Based on extensive investigations, we formalize new definitions of accountability specifically targeting the decryption process, denoted as accountable decryption , and discuss the (im)possibilities when capturing this concept. We also define the security goals in correspondence. Second, we present a novel Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)-assisted solution aligning with definitions. Instead of fully trusting TEE, we take a further step, making TEE work in the âtrust, but verifyâ model where we trust TEE and use its service, but empower users (i.e., decryptors) to detect the potentially compromised state of TEEs. Third, we implement a full-fledged system and conduct a series of evaluations. The results demonstrate that our solution is efficient. Even in a scenario involving 300, 000 log entries, the decryption process concludes in approximately 5.5ms, and malicious decryptors can be identified within 69ms.",

        "abstract": "Privacy-preserving federated learning framework has been widely applied in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenario, to enhance the privacy of local models and sensitive vehicle data. However, as increasing cyberattacks are launched against both the RSU and server side, such as node compromising and data inference attacks, it is necessary to improve the robustness of uploading local updates and prevent servers from obtaining additional private information of vehicles in the two-layered IoV model, while existing schemes hardly meet all the above-mentioned security requirements. Therefore, we propose a robust and unlinkable privacy-preserving federated learning framework RUPT-FL, that tolerates dropout RSUs while disassociating local updates from the RSUs who gathered them. Based on packed secret sharing, secure multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryption techniques, we design a robust and lightweight multi-RSUs-aided local update upload protocol for vehicles, then construct an identity-oblivious update reconstruction and aggregation protocol under the two-server model. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate that the proposed framework not only improves the robustness and accuracy of federated learning against a semi-honest adversary, but also avoids expensive computational overhead for vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning with a distributed trust framework effectively mitigates centralized security risks. However, it remains vulnerable to in-protocol DoS attacks, resulting in the malicious server refusing to aggregate the valid gradients or terminating the protocol. Additionally, it is susceptible to collaborative attacks, where compromised servers and clients can bypass gradient verification to inject backdoors. To address those issues, we propose a robust and secure aggregation scheme for federated learning, which extends the efficient 2-party computation (2PC) to a 3-party computation (3PC) with at most one malicious party, resisting abnormal termination and colluding poisoning attacks. In particular, we skillfully combine the replicated secret sharing with L2 and Lâ defense, ensuring the malformed gradients filtering with a non-interactive setup. Moreover, we integrate the player elimination framework to detect misbehavior and guarantee output delivery. The formal security analysis proves that our scheme maintains malicious security even under the colluding model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoseFL is more client-friendly and significantly enhances client efficiency by approximately 4 orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Crypto-space reversible data hiding has emerged as an effective technique for transmitting secret information over the internet. However, most existing schemes are designed for uncompressed images, while almost all images are processed and transmitted in compressed formats. There is an urgent need to develop methods for compressed images, such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). In this paper, we propose a reversible data hiding in encrypted JPEG images, where the bitstreams of AC (alternating current) coefficients and the secret data are mapped to numbers over Galois field. The obtained numbers are then utilized to conduct a polynomial for secret sharing. By reproduction into secret shares, the AC coefficients and the secret data are secured. In addition, a block sorting strategy is used to reduce image distortion under low data payload. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art methods in embedding capacity while preserving the file size and conforming to the JPEG format.",

        "abstract": "With the swift advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), various technologies have been integrated into wearable medical health devices, improving usersâ awareness of their physical states and enabling the analysis of a greater amount of human data. However, these sensitive pieces of information are prone to tampering or theft during storage and transmission, posing security risks. In this article, we propose a multi-attribute sketch secure data sharing scheme for IoT wearable medical devices based on blockchain (MASS). We introduce a multi-attribute sketch storage method that stores the encrypted hash of health data transmitted by medical wearable devices on the blockchain. This work also designs a Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPABE) access control mechanism that effectively addresses the secure sharing of data from wearable medical devices among healthcare professionals. Experimental findings indicate that with the rise in the number of medical health data documents, the costs associated with index generation and search time decrease by 55.3% and 10.83%, respectively. Additionally, as the frequency of data access increases, there is a 13.5% reduction in encryption time, and the implementation of multi-attribute sketches results in a 24.8% and 11.3% reduction in index generation and search times, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Drones (IoD) has become crucial due to the surge of drone-based applications. In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50 Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5 KB. For a sharing group of 60 receivers, drone encryption costs only about 101 ms. The decryption cost remains constant and takes about 3.1 ms.",

        "abstract": "The exploding deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) brings unprecedented challenges to the optimization of large-scale power distribution networks â numerous grid-tied devices pose severe control scalability crises. Besides, the exposure of private DER data, such as energy generation and consumption profiles, is leading to prevalent customer privacy breaches. Despite the importance, research on privacy-preserving DER control in a fully scalable manner is still lacking. To fill the gap, in this paper, a hierarchical DER aggregation and control framework is first developed to achieve scalability over the large DER population and ensure capability for privacy preservation integration. Second, a novel privacy-preserving optimization algorithm is proposed for the developed DER aggregation and control framework based on the secret sharing technique. Finally, privacy preservation guarantees of the developed algorithm are designed against honest-but-curious adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Simulations on a 13- bus test feeder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in preserving the private DER data within power distribution networks.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring the security of data outsourced to cloud is a prerequisite for the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in actual production. Secure search based on homomorphic encryption can provide high security and require no expensive setup procedure, which can be applied to resource-limited devices in IoT. However, the existing schemes usually have poor search performance and do not consider multi-owner setting. To solve these issues, we propose an efficient homomorphic encryption-based secure search scheme in multi-owner setting. Specifically, we construct a secure search protocol based on multi-key homomorphic encryption, which can be deployed in multi-owner setting. Meanwhile, we improve the efficiency of our scheme by optimizing the search algorithm. Formal security analysis proves that our scheme is secure against chosen plaintext attack, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme improves the search efficiency by 1000x when compared with state-of-the-art solutions.",

        "abstract": "Encrypted deduplication is attractive for outsourced storage as it provides both data confidentiality and storage savings. Conventional encrypted deduplication schemes protect data confidentiality based on expensive cryptographic primitives, leading to performance degradation. Recently, several SGX-based schemes have been proposed to accelerate encrypted deduplication. However, these schemes have limitations in both security and performance aspects. This paper presents a SGX-based basic scheme to address these limitations, which first performs proof of ownership (PoW), followed by key generation and data encryption, realizing a new paradigm known as PoW-before-encryption (PbE) to solve the security issue in existing schemes. Additionally, the basic scheme implements deduplication-before-encryption (DbE) to reduce redundant computations, thus improving performance. Despite these improvements, the duplicate detection and key generation in the basic scheme still involve redundant computations. Consequently, we propose an epoch-based enhanced scheme that utilizes data locality and computation deduplication, which caches fresh computations in an epoch and reuses them to enhance performance. We provide a security analysis and evaluate the performance of our schemes using both synthetic and real-world workloads. The results demonstrate that our schemes offer stronger security guarantees while outperforming state-of-the-art schemes in terms of performance.",

        "abstract": "In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), outdoor electronic devices serve crucial roles across sectors, providing vital data for decision-making. However, their exposure to open outdoor environments makes them vulnerable to unauthorized access, physical theft, or compromise, endangering both the device and its data. Ensuring the security of outdoor devices and their data is thus critical. This study addresses data security in outdoor IIoT devices by supporting the encryption of all IIoT-related data in device memory. Accessing and retrieving this data requires operations on encrypted data. Hence, we introduce a Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) scheme called MI3SE, which ensures each deviceâs encryption key is unique and valid for a period based on the deviceâs security sensitivity. Moreover, MI3SE meets key security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, forward secrecy, and backward secrecy. It is specifically designed to mitigate physical compromise and query pattern analysis through a two-keyword query approach and withstand various attacks, as validated by rigorous security analysis. Comparative evaluations against benchmark schemes underscore the efficacy of MI3SE in terms of both security and performance. Moreover, comprehensive non-mathematical security analysis and simulation experiments affirm the enhanced accuracy and efficacy of MI3SE in securing sensitive data stored in outdoor IIoT devices.",

        "abstract": "While techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) have been leveraged to secure outsourced electronic health record (EHR) computation, there are a number of known limitations (e.g., performance bottlenecks, lack of desired functionalities, or the reliance on a trusted third party). To address these challenging issues, this paper proposes MuEOC, an SGX-based multi-key homomorphic outsourcing computation scheme without a trusted third party. MuEOC is designed to support arbitrary depth multiplication and multi-key setup. In our approach, we first propose an SGX-assisted fully homomorphic encryption scheme (XFHE) under the randomized AGCD assumption. This allows us to replace costly bootstrapping with re-encryption in the enclave, and enable key-switching and Galois automorphism. Using XFHE as a building block, we construct a high-performance multi-key outsourcing computing protocol without the trusted third-party setup. Leveraging SGX, the MuEOC incorporates efficient sub-protocols of secure ciphertext transformation, secure polynomial evaluation, secure inner product, and secure non-linear function evaluation. We also present formal security proof which shows that our proposal guarantees the privacy of input EHR data and medical analysis results under the semi-honest model. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the outstanding efficiency of MuEOC.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a Rate-coded Secure Control is investigated for the consensus of Multi-agent Systems (MASs). The challenge lies in how to design a broadcasting protocol when the communication bit is critical, and to strengthen its security at the same time. A novel Rate-coded Algorithm is designed for MASs from an encoding-decoding viewpoint, where only an encrypted $L$ -length codeword, instead of the sensitive system information, is transmitted over the network between each agent and its neighbors whenever the triggering condition is satisfied. Unlike most existing results, our algorithm's triggering condition is correlated with the changing rate of the transmitted signal, effectively alleviating the signal distortion problem when its changing rate is too small or too large. As a result, the proposed Rate-coded Secure Control not only ensures uniformly bounded consensus outcomes without continuous monitoring of neighbors' states but also reduces bandwidth requirements and enhances communication security. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical finding.",

        "abstract": "The smart grid facilitates data centers in collecting real-time power consumption data from users, which is essential for effective power management. Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.",

        "abstract": "Voting protocols are fundamental in modern society. With the ongoing evolution of communication technology and the Internet of Things, the importance of electronic voting protocols is anticipated to experience a significant rise in the advancement of smart cities. Leveraging the blockchainâs tamper-resistant and publicly verifiable properties, along with the concept of enabling all participants to tally election results, blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocols effectively address the shortcomings of centralized traditional electronic voting. However, existing voting protocols still face the dual challenge of security and efficiency. The primary issues include the difficulty in ensuring voter anonymity and election fairness, as well as the insufficient system robustness and low tallying efficiency resulting from security design. To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach to constructing efficient and flexible voting protocols that concurrently ensure fairness and anonymity. Specifically, we encapsulate the decryption private keys corresponding to the public keys of encrypted ballots in time capsules to safeguard voting fairness. Additionally, based on our proposed approach, we construct an efficient and flexible score voting protocol for smart cities. The protocol employs traceable ring signature to protect the voter anonymity and public traceability, utilizes a dual-key additive homomorphic ElGamal encryption to encapsulate ballots. We also improve signature-based set membership proofs to verify the validity of ballots. Furthermore, through security analysis and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed protocol meets all security objectives with reasonable costs.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of secure recursive state estimation for a networked linear system, which may be vulnerable to interception of transmitted measurement data by eavesdroppers. To effectively protect information security, an encryption-decryption-based communication scheme can be used, but encrypting all the measurement data from sensors can result in significant computational costs. To address this issue, a partial-encryption-decryption (PED) mechanism is proposed to enhance information security with relatively low computational costs. In this mechanism, only part of the transmitted measurement signals are encrypted, and the remaining signals are transmitted directly to the estimator. A Jordan-canonical-form-based approach is developed to select the appropriate parameter for the PED mechanism, and recursive formulas for the state estimator are designed based on the principle of minimum mean squared error. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error variance matrix. Finally, the proposed PED-based recursive state estimation scheme is evaluated through two simulation examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "As the healthcare industry has continued to develop and the medical data becomes digitized, the risk of data leakage from attacks grows. All medical data is encrypted and stored to prevent data leakage, but from big data perspective, it is inefficient because the encryption of this medical data lowers the big data processing performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes an Anonymity-based Big Data Management (ABDM) for protecting healthcare data from privacy breach without compromising on performance. The idea of ABDM is to separate and store identity data and healthcare data in databases on different cloud servers. By storing the identity data and healthcare data separately in databases on different cloud servers, hackers are unable to identify whose healthcare data is obtained until they obtain both the identity data and healthcare data. Through experiments in a public cloud, ABDM outperforms existing healthcare data management systems by two times speed.",

        "abstract": "Secure neural network inference provides privacy guarantees for both the client and the server, and is an integral approach in Machine Learning as a Service setting (MLaaS). However, the multi-layer structure in the neural network introduces frequent activation function calculations, which causes large overhead. Most of the prior secure inference systems focused on designing cryptographic protocols to improve computational efficiency, but high computing and communication overhead are still bottlenecks in practicality. In this work, we refocus on the potential of shallow neural networks and propose a model with only one trainable layer to reduce the required computation. Our main contributions are in three-fold: (i) introduce training-free weights and formally prove their contribution in the model expressivity; (ii) design the Self Enhanced Module that is more suitable for shallow models as a alternative for the activation function; (iii) propose a linear layer with multi-scale and normalization property, named Nested&Norm Conv. We conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets and the results demonstrate the proposed single-layer trainable model holds promise as a viable platform for secure inference in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "The deep integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing promotes a wide deployment of Body Area Networks (BAN) for smart health services. The data security raises new challenges when patientsâ Health Records (HRs) are uploaded into the cloud server by BAN. The Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) primitive is a potential option to ensure HRs security, which provides the data confidentiality guarantee and fine-grained access control simultaneously via cryptographic means. However, most ABE schemes are unsuitable to be deployed in smart health application as access policies associated with encrypted HRs reveal patientâs privacies. Though the recently proposed ABE with partially hidden access policy based on composite order can alleviate the privacy leakage by only disclosing the attribute names and concealing the practical attribute values, the exposed attribute names still leak individual privacies. In this paper, we put forward a privacy-enhanced and efficient ABE construction with fully hidden access policy over prime order group based on the prominent ABE construction due to Bethencourt et al.. Our scheme hides the sensitive attributes in the access structure by several non-trivial designs without compromising the correctness and security. Moreover, our schemeâs performance is far superior to the attribute partially hidden schemes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the conclusion.",

        "abstract": "As a promising technology, key-aggregation searchable encryption with constant computation overhead is especially suitable for sensor nodes with limited computation resources in wireless sensor networks. However, in most of the existing key-aggregation searchable encryption schemes, the authorized aggregation key is generated in a deterministic way. As a result, these schemes suffer from âKey Forge Attackâ and âTrapdoor Forge Attackâ that we proposed and hence fail to support the security property as they claimed (which is an important goal to be achieved in key-aggregation searchable encryption schemes). To fix these flaws, in this paper, we identify the security challenges related to key-aggregation searchable encryption and propose a lightweight key-aggregation authorized searchable encryption scheme based on attribute-based encryption, called KA2SE. It enables a data owner to share encrypted data with an authorized query user by issuing only a single authorized aggregation key, and the authorized query user only needs to submit a single trapdoor to the cloud server to perform keyword search. We formulate the security definitions for KA2SE and prove its security. Finally, empirical evaluations demonstrate that KA2SE is computationally efficient in comparison with existing schemes",

        "abstract": "Scan-obfuscation schemes used with logic locking lack the ability to perform scan authentication on a per-pattern basis. These methods are of limited effectiveness in obfuscating scan data and they remain vulnerable to SAT-based scan deobfuscation attacks. In addition, prior methods designed to perform scan-data authentication are not adequate under the strongest threat models used to assess logic locking. To alleviate these problems, we propose enhancements to TaintLock, a lightweight dynamic per-pattern authentication and encryption scheme that uses taint and signature bits embedded within each test pattern to provide authenticated scan access. To prevent IP theft through Oracle-free and Oracle-guided attacks, TaintLock is paired with truly random logic locking (TRLL). TaintLock cryptographically authenticates each test pattern using the embedded taint and signature bits and passing them through a substitution-permutation (SP) network. It further uses cryptographically generated keys to dynamically encrypt scan data for unauthenticated users. TaintLock, while offering a low overhead and non-intrusive secure scan solution may remain susceptible to a new class of Oracle-reconstruction attacks that use machine learning. Additionally, assuming test pattern security is compromised, it may be potentially vulnerable to a template-based SAT attack aimed at partial key recovery. We analyze the susceptibility of TaintLock against these threats and demonstrate its resilience. We also demonstrate that TaintLock can be easily integrated with popular test architectures such as embedded deterministic test (EDT). Finally, we also discuss the reconfigurable nature of TaintLockâs architecture to support different levels of encryption and authentication.",

        "abstract": "Outsourced inference services have greatly promoted the popularization of deep learning, and neural network models can help users customize a series of personalized applications, e.g., face recognition, image classification, etc. However, untrustworthy service providers also bring a variety of security issues, such as data privacy, network model privacy, etc. Meanwhile, the malicious example will result in the output of model incorrectly. For the above concerns, this paper proposes a privacy-reserving neural network inference against adversarial example attack (PPNNI) under two non-colluding cloud servers, where a series of efficient security protocols are designed to realize private prediction based on the additive secret sharing protocol. In the semi-honest model, the servers implement the neural network's private inference in the context of an unknown input and network model. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious examples from affecting the model accuracy, we produce a method of kernel density estimation and uncertainty value in the last layer of the hidden layer to determine whether the input is adversarial examples in the domain of ciphertext. The proposed PPNNI protocol is the first effort to efficiently detect adversarial attack behaviors under the ciphertexts. The theoretical analysis illustrate that the protocol can guarantee the privacy of input data, model parameters and the inference result. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the model accuracy are about 89% and 83% respectively with malicious examples on MNIST and CIFAR10 in the domain of ciphertext and they are nearly same as 91% and 85% in the domain of plaintext, which shows the effectiveness of our protocol.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent technique of model training in Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) without sharing sensitive local data. Targeting privacy leakage of cross-device FL in CIoT, various privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed. Regrettably, existing schemes still face three significant challenges: 1) Current privacy-preserving strategies struggle to fully defend against Byzantine attacks in FL without compromising data privacy; 2) Most privacy-preserving techniques (e.g. secret sharing) in FL result in substantial computation and communication overhead; 3) The non-colluding dual-server setting limits the applicability of FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Byzantine-robust hierarchical federated learning scheme, named BHFL. This scheme not only effectively defends against Byzantine attacks while safeguarding user privacy but also avoids the need for a dual-server architecture. Simultaneously, the hierarchical aggregation structure can effectively train non-IID cross-device data while maintaining high communication efficiency. We evaluate BHFL on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that BHFL achieves high accuracy and Byzantine robustness compared to the popular FedAvg scheme. Therefore, BHFL is well-suited for CIoT scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In modern transportation systems, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide a solid foundation for improving public transportation. To efficiently realize real-time and secure vehicle communication systems, many certificateless signcryption (CLSC) schemes are proposed in VANETs. However, existing relevant CLSC schemes still have security or efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we first cryptanalyze Xie et al. 's CLSC scheme ( IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol. , vol. 72, no. 5, pp. 5642-5653, May. 2023) and demonstrate its vulnerability under public key replacement attacks. Then, we propose a pairing-free CLSC scheme for edge computing-based VANETs, with its security proven in the random oracle model. Our CLSC scheme not only achieves confidentiality and unforgeability in a single logical step, but also avoids costly certificate management and key escrow problems. Meanwhile, our construction leverages online/offline signature (OOS) and batch verification techniques, which significantly reduces communication time-delay and computational overhead. Moreover, our deployment resists multiple prevalent attacks in VANETs, including but not limited to collusion attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks, and provides pseudonym-based conditional privacy for vehicles. Finally, performance results show that our CLSC scheme outperforms existing ones, making it highly practical for VANETs.",

        "abstract": "The smart grid, which integrates ubiquitous computing, powerful sensor devices, and wireless communication technologies, is regarded as the new generation of grid system. However, privacy concerns have hindered the widespread adoption of smart grids. Numerous protocols for data aggregation with privacy-preserving features in smart grids have been proposed, but the majority rely on gateways for data aggregation and transmission. The nature of these protocols is hop-by-hop-based, which inevitably leads to a single point of compromise. On the other hand, the communication method used in data aggregation protocols for mobile sensing is end-to-end, which can address the issue of single point compromise in the smart grid. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the smart grid that supports billing computation and leakage detection. The framework is highly efficient for smart meters, as it requires the transmission of only a single piece of data in each sensing period, which can be utilized for two types of aggregation simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework effectively mitigates collusion attacks, achieves high leakage detection rate, and offers advantages in terms of communication overhead.",

        "abstract": "To safeguard Civilian Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) external information available to the platform encompassing the GNSS receiver can be used to detect attacks. Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our multi-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS receiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries spanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS constellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases (sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation) without changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity of the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150 $\\mu$ s is possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30 ns/s are also detected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the evaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.",

        "abstract": "In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the core feature lies in the secure and prompt exchange of information between vehicles. To further enhance this feature, many signcryption schemes adopted to VANETs are proposed. However, most existing schemes still suffer from security or efficiency drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a pairing-free certificate-based online/offline signcryption scheme constructed by elliptic curve, aiming to make the communication system of VANETs more lightweight and more secure. It not only ensures data confidentiality and unforgeability within one logic step but also eliminates the need of secure channels for key distribution. When deployed in VANETs, it can pre-compute many intricate operations in the offline phase and support batch verification of multiple messages. Moreover, our deployment provides pseudonym-based conditional privacy-preserving for vehicles and its traceability results about malicious behaviors can be publicly verified, guaranteeing accountability. It also considers common attacks involved in VANETs, including but not limited to impersonation attacks, collusion attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. These advantages of our construction make it highly practical for VANETs, which have been demonstrated in our simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "With the development of cryptographic tools such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and secure Multiparty Computation (MPC), privacy-preserving Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has gained attractiveness for its security when it comes to utilizing cross-domain data. However, cryptographic tools are characterized by huge overhead, which results in the MLaaS quality being unbearably degraded, especially for latency-sensitive MLaaS applications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of low-latency inference associated with MLaaS and propose CrossNet, a Privacy-preserving Neural Network Inference (PPNI) framework based on FHE, for applications with limited client-side computational and communication resources. CrossNet performs model transformations on neural networks so that they can be evaluated in an FHE-friendly manner. Model transformation introduces limited interactions between client and server, thus restricting inference latency. In addition, CrossNet includes a series of layer constructions where elaborate encoding forms and computational orders are designed to further reduce the overhead of transformed layers. CrossNet outperforms the existing FHEbased frameworks by 4x efficiency and reduces nearly 30% inference latency on ResNet-50 in a resource-limited setting.",

        "abstract": "Convergent encryption is an effective technique to achieve cross-user deduplication of encrypted data in cloud storage. However, it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks for data with low min-entropy. Moreover, once the content of the target data is successfully constructed through the aforementioned attacks, the corresponding index can also be obtained, leading to the risk of violating privacy during the process of data downloading. To address these challenges, we propose a key transferring-based secure deduplication (KTSD) scheme for cloud storage with support for ownership verification, which significantly improves the security against brute-force attacks during the ciphertext deduplication and downloading. Specifically, we introduce a randomly generated key in data encryption and downloading index generation to prevent the results from being inferred. And define a deduplication request index and a key request index by using the bloom filter to achieve brute-force attack resistant key transferring. An RSA-based ownership verification scheme is designed for the downloading process to effectively prevent privacy leakage. Finally, we prove the security of our schemes by security analysis and perform the performance evaluation experiments, the results of which show that compared to the state-of-the art, the cloud storage overhead can be reduced by 6.01% to 20.49% under KTSD.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical devices to the Internet via open communication protocols. Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities to steal data or manipulate critical IoT settings, so there is a need for strong security measures. We propose an improved Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) called the Real-Time Credibility System (RTCS), which utilizes traffic statistics and authentication analysis to compute credibility. RTCS performs the authentication process by utilizing elliptic curve encryption and decryption operations, basic symmetric encryption, and hash functions. This process enables anonymous mutual authentication between IoT devices. Subsequently, RTCS accesses sparsified user history data and introduces flexibility in calculating user credibility by employing an adapted secondary paradigm combined with pre-set âtolerance parametersâ, which serve as optimal thresholds for classifying different users. When a normal user violates regulations, their credibility decreases by a specified degree. If a high-risk user commits another violation, RTCS cannot tolerate it, leading to a rapid decline in their credibility. RTCS implements diversion measures and provides assisted decision scores for different users. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an F1 score of 0.9707 and an AUC score of 0.9535. Compared to other works, RTCS exhibits superior performance and proactivity.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is: 1) to develop an encrypted cloud-based heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) control framework to ensure the privacy of occupancy information; 2) to reduce the communication and computation costs of encrypted HVAC control; and 3) to reduce the leakage of private information via the triggering time instances in event-based encrypted HVAC control systems. Occupancy of a building is sensitive and private information that can be accurately inferred by cloud-based HVAC controllers using HVAC sensor measurements. To ensure the privacy of the occupancy information, in our framework, the sensor measurements of an HVAC system are encrypted by a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technique prior to communication with the cloud controller. We first develop an encrypted fast gradient algorithm that allows the cloud controller to regulate the indoor temperature and CO $_2$ of a building by solving two model predictive control (MPC) problems using encrypted HVAC sensor measurements. We next develop an event-triggered control policy to reduce the communication and computation costs of the encrypted HVAC control. We cast the optimal design of the event-triggering policy as an optimal control problem wherein the objective is to minimize a linear combination of the control and communication costs. Using Bellmanâs optimality principle, we study the structural properties of the optimal event-triggering policy and show that the optimal triggering policy is a function of the current state, the last communicated state with the cloud, and the time since the last communication with the cloud. We also show that the optimal design of the event-triggering policy can be transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) by introducing two new states. As the triggering time instances are not encrypted, there is a risk that the cloud may use them to deduce sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, we introduce two randomized triggering strategies th...",

        "abstract": "Data privacy preservation and secure sharing are key technical challenges faced by smart wearable healthcare IoT systems. Blockchain technology enables privacy preservation for medical data through encryption. However, conventional data encryption hampers data analysis and sharing, and decrypted data still carries the risk of leakage. Homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows computation directly on encrypted data without decryption, thus reducing the risk of data leakage during sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preservation and sharing scheme for healthcare IoT data. First, we use an improved homomorphic encryption technique to encrypt and process electronic health records (EHRs), optimizing the modular exponentiation process with a fast exponentiation algorithm, enabling users to efficiently perform data computation and analysis while keeping the data encrypted. Second, we employ symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) to encrypt homomorphic keys and user identity information, and use a Bloom filter as the mapping structure between data keywords and unique identifiers. This approach enhances search efficiency while preserving data privacy, allowing for secure search and analysis on ciphertext. Finally, smart contracts are designed to implement access control during the data-sharing process, increasing the security and transparency of data sharing. Experimental results show that the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme reduces the encryption and decryption time by an average of 34% under different key sizes, while the optimized SSE technique keeps ciphertext retrieval time at a constant level. The proposed scheme provides an effective solution for secure and efficient data analysis and retrieval, ensuring privacy preservation for the secure use and sharing of medical data.",

These advancements in IoT have greatly improved data collection and analysis capabilities, especially for health monitoring applications. However, traditional centralized machine learning methods often fall short, raising significant privacy concerns and requiring extensive data collection, which is inefficient. To address these limitations within the distributed IoT environment, this paper presents a federated learning-based WiFi sensing system specifically designed for health monitoring. By enabling local model training, our system prevents the sharing of sensitive data, thus reducing the risk of privacy breaches. We further enhance our system with a secret sharing mechanism coupled with model sparsification to significantly improve privacy. Additionally, our improved Top-k model sparsification algorithm, equipped with adaptive residuals, reduces communication overhead while ensuring high accuracy. Extensive testing across various datasets and models confirms that our system outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of privacy protection and communication efficiency, marking a substantial advancement in health monitoring within the IoT.",

Cryptographic operations play an inevitable role in enhancing healthcare services and ensuring medical data privacy. with more and more migration to blockchain-based healthcare services, strong cryptographic techniques are proposed to overcome the challenges faced. This paper presents a secure framework that integrates privacy preserving parameters, zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), blockchain technology, and a multi-tenant cloud environment. The framework ensures that healthcare records remain protected during analytics computations without exposing raw data using advanced cryptographic techniques, specifically zk-SNARKs. The privacy-preserving analytics engine utilizes anonymized healthcare records and generates zk-SNARKs to validate computations. These proofs, integrated into a blockchain network, create a tamper-proof, transparent ledger that ensures secure healthcare transactions. A telemedicine app applies this algorithm, showcasing its practical application and tackling the complex balance between data utility and privacy in healthcare analytics.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile computing and the popularity of mobile devices equipped with GPS technology, massive spatial data have become available. Enterprises upload encrypted spatial data to the mobile cloud to save local storage and computation costs. However, the existing secure Geometric Range Search (GRS) solutions are inefficient in terms of building, updating index structure and querying processes. Moreover, the index structures of existing GRS schemes based on Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) leak location order, which may lead to reconstruction attacks. To solve these issues, we first propose an efficient and secure GRS scheme using Radix-Tree, namely GRSRT-I. Specifically, we construct an index structure based on Radix-tree to achieve efficient search and update, then use homomorphic encryption NTRU to resist chosen-plaintext attack, finally design a dual-server architecture to alleviate the burdens on mobile users caused by multiple rounds of interactions. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced scheme, GRSRT-II, by combining Order-Revealing Encryption and OPE, which greatly improves the search efficiency while slightly reducing the security. We formally prove the security of our proposed schemes, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that GRSRT-I can improve the query efficiency by up to at least 1.5 times when compared with previous solutions and GRSRT-II can achieve a higher level of search efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing has significantly advanced medical data storage capabilities, enabling healthcare institutions to outsource data management. However, this shift introduces critical security and privacy risks, as sensitive patient information is stored on untrusted third-party servers. Existing cryptographic solutions, such as searchable encryption, offer some security guarantees but struggle with challenges like leakage-based attacks, high computational overhead, and limited scalability. To address these limitations in medical data outsourcing, we present ECMO, a novel protocol that combines an ordered additive secret sharing algorithm with a unique index permutation method. This approach efficiently outsources medical data while safeguarding both the data itself and access patterns from potential leakage. Our experimental results demonstrate ECMO's efficiency and scalability, with a single store operation containing 500 keywords taking only 42.5Î¼s on average.",

        "abstract": "In this digital era, images are the most vital information carrier used for healthcare communication and entertainment. However, the increasing use of images in several applications also poses a risk of their unauthorised usage or modification without proper attribution to the owner. To overcome this issue while ensuring one-time password (OTP)âbased system authentication, this study designed a highly secure healthcare imaging system with multimodal biometrics, data hiding and encryption in a deep learning environment. First, we segmented a medical image via a customised, deep neural network to locate the lesion and non-lesion areas. Next, the lesion part was embedded into the non-lesion part via least significant bit (LSB) substitution and timestamp. Furthermore, the marked non-lesion and lesion parts were combined to generate the marked image. Second, encoded multimodal biometric features, i.e. face and iris, and a novel 2D chaotic system were used to encrypt the marked image before transmission over the network. Through simulation findings on security and accuracy of segmentation and feature extraction design, we demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed secure system, highlighting their superior performance compared to existing techniques.",

        "abstract": "Silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as a promising solution for generating cryptographic keys in low-cost resource-constrained devices. A PUF is expected to be reliable, meaning that its response bits should remain consistent each time the corresponding challenges are queried. Unfortunately, the stability of these challenge-response pairs (CRPs) can be seriously eroded by environmental factors like temperature variations and the aging of the integrated circuits implementing the PUF. Several approaches, including bit masking, bit selection techniques, and error-correcting codes, have been proposed to obtain a reliable PUF operation in the face of temperature variations. As for aging, a new kind of aging-resilient silicon PUF has been reported that uses the time-varying phenomenon known as Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) as the underlying entropy source. Although this type of PUF preserves its reliability well when aged, it is not immune to the impact of temperature variations. The work presented here shows that it is possible to improve the thermal reliability of RTN-based PUFs with a proper combination of (a) a novel optimization-based bit selection technique, that is also applicable to other types of PUFs based on differential measurements; and (b) a temperature-aware tuning of the entropy-harvesting function.",

        "abstract": "Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) enable communication among vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) with a dedicated short range communications (DSRC). In VANETs, the real-time trajectory prediction service can be provided by roadside units (RSUs) using data collected from vehicles. This service is important for the prevention of traffic accidents. Due to the openness of the communication in VANETs, the transmitted data is vulnerable to illegal users' attacks that results in the leakage of vehicles' data. To address the above concerns, a privacy-preserving multi-party computation scheme with secret sharing is proposed for vehicle trajectory prediction in VANETs. The proposed scheme is designed to protect the privacy of transmitted vehicle data during trajectory prediction. Note that four distributed interactive protocols of \boldsymbol{(\\cdot)}\n, \boldsymbol{SecExp( \\cdot)}\n, \boldsymbol{SecRec(\\cdot)}\nand \boldsymbol{SecCmp(\\cdot)}\nare introduced to carry out the computation of nonlinear logarithm, exponent, reciprocal and comparison functions in the proposed scheme. The aforementioned interactive protocols facilitate the distributed deployment of the Adaboost ensemble learning algorithm among multiple RSUs, while ensuring the privacy of vehicle data using secret sharing simultaneously. Security analysis proves that the proposed scheme can effectively protect the privacy of vehicle data. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has a minimal impact on the prediction accuracy of the Adaboost algorithm compared to the differential privacy (DP)-based scheme. Furthermore, the low latency of the proposed scheme allows for efficient trajectory prediction, as demonstrated by the runtime of the proposed scheme on test set.",

        "abstract": "This article is concerned with the co-design of privacy-preserving and resilient consensus protocol for a class of multiagent networks (MANs), where the information exchanges over communication networks among the agents suffer from eavesdropping and Sybil attacks. First, we introduce a new attack model in which an adversarial agent could launch a Sybil attack, generating a large number of spurious entities in the network, thereby gaining disproportionate influence. In this communication framework, a whole-process privacy-preserving mechanism is designed that is capable of protecting both initial and current states of agents. Then, instead of existing methods requiring identifying and mitigating Sybil nodes, a degree-based mean-subsequence-reduced (D-MSR) resilient strategy is implemented, showcasing its significant properties: 1) ensuring the effectiveness of aforementioned designed privacy protection strategy; 2) allowing the network to contain Sybil nodes without elimination; and 3) reaching consensus among the normal agents. Finally, several numerical simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed results.",

        "abstract": "As the Internet of Things progresses, the volume of information stored in electronic devices has surged dramatically. Employing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to model graph data derived from link relationships has led to widespread applications in consumer electronics, such as user preference analysis and personalized recommendations. However, with practical graph data scattered among various owners, traditional centralized GCN methods falter owing to privacy constraints. Thus, creating a distributed GCN framework that upholds model quality and user privacy remains a daunting task. In this paper, we pioneer the use of functional encryption in a federated learning GCN framework, termed FPGCN. This innovative technique achieves performance parity with centralized GCNs, capable of producing equivalent node representations without the need for direct access to raw data. By employing a hierarchical split learning framework coupled with privacy-preserving aggregation mechanisms, it enables secure and collaborative multi-party GCN training, ensuring confidentiality while maintaining model efficacy. Comprehensive experimental results in three real-world datasets demonstrate the capacity of FPGCN to match the predictive accuracy observed in centralized scenarios, while also showcasing its performance efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Reversible data hiding (RDH) is one special type of data hiding, and is widely used for many intended applications. Moreover, to protect the cover image, RDH in encrypted image (RDHEI) schemes are accordingly proposed. In RDHEI, if the marked image is lost, the cover image and the secret data cannot be restored. To address the issue of losing sub marked images, RDH in shared image (RDHSI) by secret sharing (SS) is proposed to achieve fault-tolerance. Recently, an anonymous application scenario using RDHSI is introduced, on which multiple data hiders in RDHSI serve as reviewers in a committee. When the number of agreement votes is above the threshold of SS, the application is approved. However, there are weaknesses in this application framework: (i) reviewers cannot provide equal right to vote (namely, they cannot cast âYesâ and âNoâ votes, respectively), and (ii) anonymous submission is not really achieved. In the paper, we propose a new RDHSI to allow data hiders can hide approved sub data or disapproved sub data into sub images. Therefore, how to perform recovery and extraction from n marked images (some embedded with âYesâ votes and some with âNoâ votes) should be carefully designed. Based on the consistency property of polynomial interpolation, we conduct verification, recovery and extraction algorithms from n marked images. In addition, we use Hamming codewords to represent pixel difference instead of directly hiding pixel difference for reversibility, and this improvement also improves the embedding capacity. Compare with the current anonymous application scheme using RDHSI, the embedding rate in this paper can reach 3.5 bits per pixel (bpp), which is an improvement of 2 bpp. Thus, it is more suitable for the anonymous submission of application framework.",

        "abstract": "The primary computational complexity of the lattice-based post-quantum cryptosystems (PQCs), aside from hashing, comes from the polynomial multiplication. Especially, the multiplication efficiency of large-degree polynomials becomes increasingly important for current applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose efficient polynomial multiplication methods, termed as the extended number theoretic transform (NTT), eventually aimed at developing efficient light-weight PQCs suitable for the Internet of Things. The proposed methods utilize the extension of finite fields and an early termination technique to enable efficient NTT implementation using better parameter values. The adoption of arithmetic in the extension field Fqm provides more efficient NTT computation, even when a primitive 2n-th root of unity, required for NTT, does not exist in the base field Zq. More importantly, the proposed methods allow for more flexible selection of PQC parameters. Moreover, by using early termination of NTT over the extension field, we further enhance the efficiency of polynomial multiplication. As a result, the proposed methods flexibly select suitable (or smaller) modulus q by optimizing the extension degree m and the incomplete degree l. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our methods by demonstrating their capability to offer a wide range of parameter values and significantly reduce the size of modulus q. It is confirmed through simulation that the communication efficiency and security are improved by up to 21.43% and 9.09%, respectively. Finally, it is shown that light-weight Crystals-Kyber can be easily constructed by using the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Aggregating metadata in the ciphertext field is an attractive property brought by homomorphic encryption (HE) for privacy-sensitive computing tasks, therefore, research on the next-generation wireless networks has treated it as one of the promising cryptographic techniques for various scenarios. However, existing schemes are far from being deployed in various computing scenarios due to their high computational complexity and ciphertext expansion, especially for bandwidth-limited and latency-sensitive wireless scenarios. In this paper, we propose the AirHE scheme to achieve homomorphic evaluation via the over-the-air computation in the physical layer. Moreover, we propose a new encryption scheme that can be integrated with the physical layer procedure. A new error control mechanism for ciphertext is further proposed to solve the error accumulation problem. The novelty of the AirHE scheme is to take advantage of the intrinsic superposition characteristic of the wireless channel, such that the communication and computation cost is greatly reduced by achieving homomorphic evaluation and error control of ciphertext in the physical layer. We implement the AirHE scheme based on the LTE system and validate its feasibility. Simulation results are also presented to show the performance of the AirHE scheme under different channel conditions.",

        "abstract": "Medical records contain highly sensitive patient information. These medical records are significant for better research, diagnosis, and treatment. However, ensuring secure medical records storage is paramount to protect patient confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. Conventional methods involve encrypting and storing medical records in third-party clouds. Such storage enables convenient access and remote consultation. This cloud storage poses single-point attack risks and may lead to erroneous diagnoses and treatment. To address this, a novel (n,n)VSS scheme is proposed with data embedding, permutation ordered binary number system, tamper detection, and self-recovery mechanism. This approach enables the reconstruction of medical records even in the case of tampering. The tamper detection algorithm ensures data integrity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of proposed method in terms of security and reconstruction quality. Here, security analysis is done by considering attacks such as brute force, differential, and tampering attacks. Similarly, the reconstruction quality is evaluated using various human visual system parameters. The results show that the proposed technique provides a lower bit error rate ( $\u0007pprox$ 0), high average peak signal-to-noise ratio ( $\u0007pprox$ 35 dB), high structured similarity ( $\u0007pprox$ 1), high text embedding rate ( $\u0007pprox$ 0.7 BPP), and lossless reconstruction in the case of attacks.",

        "abstract": "Multi-path avoidance routing for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a secure routing paradigm against adversaries with unbounded computational power. The key idea of avoidance routing is to encode a message into several pieces by the XOR coding, and each piece is routed via different paths. Then, an adversary cannot obtain the original message unless she eavesdrops on all message pieces from all the paths. In this paper, we extend such an approach into secure multicast routing, which is a one-to-many communication primitive. To this end, we propose the multi-tree-based avoidance multicast routing protocol (AMRP) for WSNs, in which a set of adversary disjoint trees is discovered, i.e., a set of multicast trees with no common adversaries. When a set of multicast trees is adversary disjoint, no adversary can eavesdrop on all message pieces to recover the original message. In addition, optimized AMRP (OAMRP) is proposed in order to reduce the control overhead of AMRP, where additional multicast trees are used for only a subset of destination nodes with no single safe tree. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocols achieve higher secure delivery rates than a simple extension of the existing unicast avoidance routing protocol.",

        "abstract": "Anonymous messaging system allows users to deliver messages without revealing the sending content and their identifiers, which has attracted ongoing concerns. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing solutions still fail to protect users' privacy under coercion. That is, the user's communication transcripts might be tracked and cached, and later coerced to reveal the underlying messages associated with the ciphertexts due to law enforcement reasons or for evil purposes. In addition, anonymity alone is not enough for some practical scenarios. For instance, a journalist just wants to communicate with those intended informants, and thereby gather information from anonymous but authenticated sources. In this paper, to address the above-mentioned issues, we introduce an authenticated and deniable anonymous messaging framework. Its core component is a new cryptographic primitive dubbed deniable identity-based matchmaking encryption (DIB-ME), which captures plausible deniability under coercion and mutual authentication without interactions simultaneously. We further present a concrete DIB-ME construction and prove its security in the random oracle model. The performance analysis indicates merits of the proposed DIB-ME scheme. We also implement the proposed DIB-ME construction and present extensive experiment results, as a proof of concept to demonstrate its soundness and practicability.",

        "abstract": "Network path validation aims to give more control over the forwarding path of data packets in a path-aware network, which shields the network from security threats and allows end hosts to receive better services. Therefore, network path validation becomes a vital primitive for secure and reliable Internet services in the next generation networks. The path validation enables end hosts and intermediate router nodes to check whether a packet has followed the intended path. However, the existing solutions fail to protect path privacy and incur significant bandwidth and computation overhead on packet transferring, which degrades packet delivery performance. In this paper, we propose the StealthPath to protect path privacy and improve delivery efficiency. Firstly, StealthPath uses lightweight cryptographic primitives to generate nested proofs and ensures all nodes on the path to check the compliance of the forwarding path efficiently. Secondly, StealthPath hides the forwarding path in the proofs and reduces the proof size from linear to constant, which protects the path information and path length, and decreases the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, StealthPath allows on-path nodes to extract their proofs and the next hop address from proof without leaking on-path node index. Finally, StealthPath is proved to resist various attacks and preserves the path privacy. The experiments show that StealthPath saves nearly 60% header size and bandwidth, and is more efficient than state-of-the-art schemes.",

        "abstract": "IoT-based sharing economy is a win-win business model, where a transferor owns idle IoT devices and transfers the right to use a device to a user for a fee. Considering usage of multiple devices and privacy preservation, anonymous single-sign-on (ASSO) is a feasible solution for authentication. ASSO allows a user to access multiple devices with one token issued by the transferor and prevents the transferor from identifying the user. We also observe that in the scenario of IoT-based sharing economy, the token should (i) support attributes since a device should be available only to users with specific attributes (e.g., age) and (ii) avoid incurring significant communication/computation overhead as IoT devices are resource-constrained. In this paper, we proposed PILOT, a privacy-preserving single-sign-on with fine-grained access control for IoT devices. When a user attempts to access a device, he/she requests a token from the transferor. The token is actually a blind signature that cannot be tracked, and contains the user's attributes which facilitate fine-grained access control on the device. Besides, the token consists of only four group elements and verification of the token involves only several exponentiation operations. This renders PILOT superior in terms of communication/computation overhead and suitable for IoT devices.",

        "abstract": "Cyber attacks can infect networked devices with rootkits that provide full-system access of the operating system to malicious actors. Rootkits can hide malicious network activity by tampering with network traffic monitoring on the host and interfere with the functioning of host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). Network interface cards (NICs) operate outside the host domain, so they cannot be tampered with easily by the rootkit. We present a framework that leverages the NIC to collect tamper-proof network traffic measurements for the HIDS. We provide two efficient implementations to collect measurements of high speed traffic (10Gbps), the Associative Table and the Count-Min Sketch. Our framework can collect reliably accurate measurements with negligible impact to network performance. The network throughput with measurement collection is within 99.5% of the throughput without collection. The implementation adds only 12 to 23 microseconds of latency.",

        "abstract": "Vertical federated feature selection can select effective features and avoid overfitting in vertical federated learning. However, existing privacy-preserving techniques for vertical federated feature selection are limited to selecting task-related features and cannot reduce redundant features among clients, resulting in performance loss. This article introduces a mutual information-based federated feature selection (MUSE) framework to address these issues. In the MUSE framework, the correlation of cross-device feature-feature and feature-class is estimated by our defined privacy-preserving mutual information, called federated mutual information (FMI). To compute FMI, we propose the anonymous bin matching (ABM) algorithm, which only uses the intersection size of bins rather than bin elements to avoid sample-IDs leakage. With FMI, MUSE can support the minimized dependency feature selection criteria for removing redundant features. Additionally, we propose the local feature preselection to reduce the computation cost of FMI. It is theoretically and experimentally proved as a close approximation of the global optimum under certain constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MUSE framework on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art federated feature selection methods across most datasets.

        "abstract": "The insecurities of public-key infrastructure on the Internet have been the focus of research for over a decade. The extensive presence of broken, weak, and vulnerable cryptographic keys has been repeatedly emphasized by many studies. Analyzing the security implications of cryptographic keysâ vulnerabilities, several studies noted the presence of public key reuse. While the phenomenon of private key sharing was extensively studied, the prevalence of public key sharing on the Internet remains largely unknown. In this work, we perform a large-scale analysis of public key reuse within the PKI ecosystem. We investigate the presence and distribution of duplicate X.509 certificates and reused RSA public keys across a large collection containing over 314 million certificates and over 13 million SSH keys collected by different sources at different times. We analyze the cryptographic weaknesses of duplicate certificates and reused keys and investigate the reasons and sources of reuse. Our results reveal that certificate and key sharing are common and persistent. Our findings show over 10 million certificates and 17 million public keys are reused across time and shared between our collections. We observe keys with non-compliant cryptographic elements stay available for an extended period of time.",

        "abstract": "With the growing popularity of cloud services, companies and individuals outsource images to cloud servers to reduce storage and computing burdens. The images are encrypted before outsourcing for privacy protection. It has become urgent to solve the privacy-preserving image retrieval problem on the cloud. There are three main challenges in this area. First, how can we achieve high retrieval accuracy on the encryption domain? Second, how can we improve efficiency in large-scale encrypted image retrieval? Third, how can we ensure the reliability of the retrieval results? The existing schemes only consider some of these characteristics and the retrieval accuracy is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving large-scale image retrieval framework with vision graph convolutional neural network hashing (ViGH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that is able to address all the above challenges with more advanced accuracy performance. To be specific, cycle-consistent adversarial networks and vision graph convolutional networks (ViG) are utilized to increase retrieval accuracy. By embedding encrypted images into hash codes, we can obtain high retrieval efficiency by Hamming distances. Cloud servers store the hash codes on the blockchain (Ethereum). The retrieval algorithm on the smart contracts and the consensus mechanism of blockchain ensure reliability of the retrieval results. The experimental results on three common datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving image retrieval framework. The reliability of the retrieval results is ensured by the consensus mechanism of blockchain with no need for verification. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/ViGH .",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an adjustable security scheme based on pseudo-noise key distribution and circular domain decision optimization has been introduced. We employ chaotic mappings with adjustable dimensionality to generate keys, which are used to encrypt the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The pseudo-noise key allocation can mask the key information of the chaotic system as noise and transmit it concurrently with the encrypted signal. To enhance the transmission performance, we adopt a circular domain partitioning scheme to optimize the process of demodulation. Our strategy employs a soft-decision method in regions with higher decision difficulty, mitigating the shortcomings of limited precision in hard-decision method. For the symbols and pseudo-noise key with low decision difficulty, a hard decision strategy is adopted to avoid introducing high complexity. Transmission of a 27.72 Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) OFDM signal over a 2-km 7-core optical fiber is experimentally demonstrated. The results indicate that the proposed strategy, by optimizing the demodulation method for some received symbols, improved the receiver sensitivity by 0.75 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 7.8Ã10 -5 . At the same time, while enhancing the flexibility of the encryption and demodulation modules, the encryption scheme can extend the cracking timescale to the order of 10 108 years.",

        "abstract": "We present secondary constructions of vectorial functions respectively partitions of elementary abelian groups, which simultaneously yield vectorial dual-bent functions with certain properties, bent partitions, and under some conditions, Latin square partial difference set packings (LP-packings). First, we analyse constructions via the direct sum of vectorial functions and then present a version of the generalized Maiorana-McFarland construction. Next, we generalize a construction of vectorial dual-bent functions by Wang, Fu, and Wei (2023). Finally, we use a lifting procedure of LP-packings from Jedwab and Li (2021) to construct vectorial dual-bent functions, bent partitions, and LP-packings in elementary abelian groups. With these constructions, a large variety of vectorial bent functions, bent partitions, LP-packings, and related amorphic association schemes can be obtained.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising technology to equip transportation management systems with digitalized ability. The deployed IoV devices allow traffic participants to generate and analyze the traffic information such as driving status and road condition. They can further share the collected traffic data through the centralized cloud service to improve road operation efficiency, safety and reduce economic losses. Storing sensitive traffic data in an untrusted cloud server, however, raises the requirement of data access control to protect valuable business issues. Unfortunately, using pure cryptographic access control schemes for traffic data faces several limitations. In this paper, we first develop a pure cryptographic construction to enforce attribute-based access control (ABAC) model in untrusted cloud for IoV system based on ciphertext policy-attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) and explore three limitations of it. By studying ABAC in the context of CP-ABE, we can effectively lower-bound the costs that would be incurred when using more advanced and more expensive predicate encryption schemes. We then propose a new attribute based access control system (AACS) for cloud-aided IoV system to overcome the barriers of CP-ABE by using trusted hardware (Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)). AACS uses a secure data division framework to achieve a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB) and integrates SGX with several cryptographic protocols as well as optimization techniques. We comprehensively evaluate AACS to show the design advantages of it",

        "abstract": "This article is concerned with the secure state estimation problem for artificial neural networks (ANNs) subject to unknown-but-bounded noises, where sensors and the remote estimator are connected via open and bandwidth-limited communication networks. Using the encoding-decoding mechanism (EDM) and the Paillier encryption technique, a novel homomorphic encryption scheme (HES) is introduced, which aims to ensure the secure transmission of measurement information within communication networks that are constrained by bandwidth. Under this encodingâdecoding-based HES, the data being transmitted can be encrypted into ciphertexts comprising finite bits. The emphasis of this research is placed on the development of a secure set-membership state estimation algorithm, which allows for the computation of estimates using encrypted data without the need for decryption, thereby ensuring data security throughout the entire estimation process. Taking into account the unknown-but-bounded noises, the underlying ANN, and the adopted HES, sufficient conditions are determined for the existence of the desired ellipsoidal set. The related secure state estimator gains are then derived by addressing optimization problems using the Lagrange multiplier method. Lastly, an example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed secure state estimation approach.",

        "abstract": "With the expansion of mobile devices and cloud computing, massive spatial trajectory data is generated and outsourced to the cloud for storage and analysis, enabling location-based mobile computing services. However, due to the sensitivity of the trajectory data, sharing it in plaintext could lead to privacy risks, especially in operations like contact queries. Thus, achieving secure and efficient contact queries based on the trajectory data in the cloud is a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving contact query processing over trajectory data in mobile cloud computing. The projection-based secure trajectory encoding is designed to convert trajectories into secure codes such that the comparison between the distance of two moving objects and the contact distance threshold is transformed into a problem of secure code matching. Adopting the secure code matching method, a baseline privacypreserving contact query processing is proposed. To improve the query accuracy and efficiency, an amplification factor, an HTG-index and a filter table are designed for query processing optimization, based on which an enhanced privacy-preserving contact query processing is proposed. The game stimulationbased security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed query scheme is secure and performs well in query accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Open radio access network (ORAN)-based vehicular networks play a pivotal role in future traffic data sharing. Due to the openness of the ORAN framework, it is necessary to encrypt the sharing data to prevent unauthorized access or misuse by malicious participants. However, current efforts struggle to address some emerging security requirements, such as the bilateral control of sending and access rights in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications, as well as evolving replay attack on encrypted data. With these challenges, this paper presents a fine-grained access control encryption (FGACE) scheme for secure communication in ORAN-based vehicular networks. Our FGACE enables fine-grained and bilateral control over senders and receivers. We design a novel sanitization algorithm against dishonest sanitizer and replay attack. Furthermore, we deeply explore security models for replay attack on encrypted data to support secure sanitization, i.e., attribute-based replayable CCA security and related definitions. We prove that our FGACE satisfies the proposed security definitions. Feature comparison demonstrates that our scheme does better in security and privacy. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms compared schemes. When the number of attributes increases to 50, our total computational overhead is lowest, and the total storage overhead is approximately less than 1/3 of other schemes. The impressive performance indicates that our FGACE is practical in ORAN-based vehicular networks.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for processing and learning graph data. However, due to the existence of data silos, the privacy of data and the processing result is an important concern. Meanwhile, the malicious example will result in the incorrect output of the model. For the above concerns, this paper proposes privacy-enhanced federated graph network inference against adversarial example attack. Specifically, we adopt secret sharing and homomorphic encryption to ensure the privacy of graph data, where the user can get the final inference, and the server holds nothing except the model parameters. Moreover, in order to prevent malicious users from interfering with the accuracy of the model, an adversarial example detection mechanism on the ciphertext is designed to identify local embedding submitted by malicious users. During the whole process, both local and global embedding are both protected. The experimental results show that the model accuracy is about 69% and 66% with malicious samples on Cora and Citeseer in the domain of ciphertext respectively and they are nearly same as 70% and 69% in the domain of plaintext, which shows the effectiveness of our protocol.",

        "abstract": "The metaverse offers an unprecedented immersive experience and a fresh connection paradigm for consumers, which brings security threats related to unauthorized data access, potential misuse, and increasing attacks in the bilateral information flow. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an efficient and secure access control scheme. However, current efforts struggle to address these more complicated security issues. To do this, in this paper, we present an expressive access control encryption (EACE) scheme for bilateral control of information flow in metaverse-enabled consumer electronics. Our EACE supports fine-grained and bilateral control of senders and receivers by carefully taking advantage of access control encryption, dual-policy attribute-based encryption, and matchmaking encryption. Furthermore, we propose a novel sanitization algorithm with sender anonymity and bilateral policy privacy against the malicious sanitizer. We formalize the corresponding security definitions and give rigorous proofs. Performance analysis demonstrates that our EACE can simultaneously achieve bilateral control with policy privacy, sender anonymity against sanitizer, and lightweight decryption. The experimental results show that our proposal costs less computational and storage overhead in the symmetric bilinear group. The impressive performance indicates that our EACE is an excellent choice to balance security and efficiency when consumer electronics meet the metaverse.",

However, due to concerns about data security and privacy disclosure, conventional data-centralized deep learning often faces difficulties about data famine and data islands. Federated learning (FL) as a novel privacy-preserving deep learning paradigm breaks the data islands among different smart factories by sharing their model parameters instead of raw data, which essentially solves the data famine problem for training a high-quality deep learning model. Nevertheless, exchanging numerous model parameters not only generates considerable communication overhead but also poses the risk of privacy information disclosure hidden in model parameters due to inference attacks launched by external attackers or honest-but-curious servers. The purpose of this article is to build a high-quality trustworthy FL architecture dubbed TrustFedGRU for IIoT while alleviating the communication overhead. First, a multikey decryption assisted privacy-preserving homomorphic encryption scheme is proposed in FL to meet the distinct privacy-preserving requirements of different data owners without impairing model performance. Furthermore, tensor decomposition is leveraged to convert the weight tensor of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) into a low-rank approximation, so as to reduce the communication bandwidth overhead and decrease the storage requirements. Meanwhile, a novel dynamic update-based FL approach is investigated to improve the model performance. The experimental results show that the proposed TrustFedGRU greatly reduces the communication overhead while guaranteeing the model performance and security.",

        "abstract": "Encrypted database is an emerging and promising technology that is able to run SQL operations on encrypted data. However, most existing encrypted databases have no data interoperability, i.e., the output of an operator (e.g., addition) cannot be taken as input of another (e.g., comparison). As a result, these encrypted databases can only support simple queries like addition, multiplication and comparison, but unable to support a composition of these simple queries (e.g., SELECT user id FROM salary WHERE V1 + V2 > 5000). In SIGMOD '14, Wong et al. propose SDB, which to the best of our knowledge is the only encrypted database that achieves data interoperability. Unfortunately, it has recently been broken (VLDB '21). In this paper, we propose a novel encrypted database named SDB+. It achieves data interoperability based on a suit of sophisticated designs. We formally prove that SDB+ achieves indistinguishability under chosen query attacks (IND-CQA). We provide a full-fledged implementation and run it on three benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SDB+ achieves comparable efficiency with SDB, even though the latter is insecure.",

        "abstract": "Due to the introduction of cloud computing in healthcare services, personal health records (PHRs) have being uploaded to cloud servers in increasing numbers. Since data confidentiality requirements exist, data owners should encrypt their PHRs in advance of transmitting them to a cloud server. Attribute-based encryption with keyword search (ABKS) technique ensures that the encrypted PHRs are able to retrieved by other data users whose attributes match access polices granted by data owners. However, access polices are public in most existing ABKS schemes, which can reveal sensitive information contained in PHRs. In this article, we provide an efficient ABKS scheme with policy hiding for PHRs that implements the following features: (1) The fine-grained access control is achieved where data owners can authorize which data users can retrieve encrypted PHRs. (2) The access policy is hidden to safeguard sensitive information from being leaked. (3) The costs of storage and computation do not grow linearly as the number of attributes increases. The security of the presented ABKS scheme is reduced to the truncated q-DABDHE assumption and the DDH assumption. Its performance is also demonstrated by our extensive simulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "In the distributed computing environment, it is important to efficiently achieve secure access to data. One of the widely applied encryption mechanisms is the multi-authority attribute-based encryption. However, most existing multi-authority setting schemes were relied on bilinear pairings, which causes the system to bear a relatively large burden in computation overhead. In this paper, we proposes a decentralized multi-authority key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme without bilinear pairings, its security is relied solely on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. It removes the trusted central authority and prevents user collusion attacks. Except for the global coordination between the attribute authorities, any party can simply play the part of a standard attribute authority by generating public keys and issuing corresponding decryption key components for users. The proposed scheme provides heightened security and efficiency compared to the current pairing-free multi-authority ABE scheme, as well as superior computational efficiency when compared to those utilizing bilinear pairings.",

        "abstract": "Existing effective cover selection methods aim to select the complex images as covers to achieve the highly security with the aid of the embedding distortion computed from a natural image. However, the calculation of the embedding distortion divulges the image content to a steganographer. To overcome this issue, this work proposes a novel cover selection scheme in encrypted images to achieve the image content-protection and cover-selection simultaneously. In the first phase, the content owner encrypts several most significant bits (MSBs) of each image using an encryption key and the encrypted image is shuffled by block. Meanwhile, with a sampling key, the content owner selects some encrypted blocks and outputs them to the steganographer. In the second phase, the steganographer calculates first-order noise residuals of adjacent pixels of the acquired blocks along different directions. Importantly, we design a texture descriptor named as structured Local binary pattern (SLBP) to encode all the residuals by which the images owing the maximal SLBP values are chosen as the optimal covers. We demonstrate the security of our proposed scheme on multiple steganographic and steganalytic methods and the extensive results show that our scheme exhibits excellent performance without knowing of the original image content. Moreover, the results testify that the designed SLBP achieves the perfect evaluation of image complexity.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, encrypted video streaming takes up an increasing proportion of mobile network traffic, with encrypted video streams playing a significant role in illegal video detection. However, there are challenges in performing content analysis of encrypted video streams, including label limitations and complex calculations. In this paper, we proposed a low-dimensional embedding method based on Byte Rate Sequences (BRS), named EVS2vec (Encrypted Video Stream to Vector), to solve these problems effectively. It can represent the content of encrypted video streams with low-dimensional vectors by mapping the indefinite-length sequence into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. EVS2vec can thereby be applied for not only supervised analysis but also unsupervised analysis. Furthermore, using BRS can also save the time overhead on fine-grained network traffic parsing. In order to ensure the content-related distinguishability of the embedding result, inspired by contrastive learning, we designed a network structure based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with self-attention mechanism in EVS2vec and trained it using triplet network. The experiments on a public dataset show that EVS2vec saves storage overhead while containing enough video content information. EVS2vec can achieve a high accuracy of similarity threshold, reaching 96.89%. An 8-dimensional fingerprint for each video is constructed. Moreover, classification and clustering analysis can also be performed with acceptable results.",

        "abstract": "Truth discovery is an effective technique for resolving data conflicts in crowdsensing. Fog-based mobile crowdsensing utilizes low-latency and high-efficiency communications capabilities of fog computing to achieve large-scale data sensing at a low cost. Privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the inclusion of users' sensitive information in sensory data. However, existing PPTDs have not adequately addressed fog servers' reliability and mobile devices' efficiency simultaneously. Challenges are that fog servers are susceptible to breakdowns and collusion that causes privacy breaches, while mobile devices have limited resources. We thus propose a reliable and efficient PPTD for fog-based crowdsensing. We employ a threshold secret sharing scheme to establish secure multi-party computation primitives. These primitives are then used to construct an arithmetic circuit-an essential component of the PPTD. This approach preserves privacy of sensory data, as well as intermediate and final results, while accounting for server collusion, dropout, and mobile devices' efficiency. It has $T$ -out-of- $N$ threshold reliability that resists ( $T-1$ ) servers' collusion and ( $N-T$ ) servers' dropout. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme reduces worker processing time by at least one order of magnitude and network communication overhead by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to existing PPTD methods.",

        "abstract": "Smart tags are compact electronic devices affixed to or embedded into objects to facilitate identification, monitoring, and data exchange. Consequently, secure authentication of these tags is a crucial issue, as objects must reliably verify their identity before sharing sensitive information with other entities. The application of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) as a device's âdigital fingerprintâ has attracted significant attention, yet existing PUF-based authentication methods exhibit security vulnerabilities, either due to the authentication protocol itself or the limited reliability of the PUF technology used. Moreover, there has been a considerable focus on the software aspect, often overlooking the critical role of hardware design, which can become a target for attacks aimed at compromising the device's identity or act as a hindrance in the manufacturing process. In light of these points, this paper introduces an identification tag architecture that leverages PUF technology, focusing on authentication. This architecture features a straightforward but efficient authentication protocol, underpinned by a new and highly stable PUF model. The overall architecture encompasses particular hardware implementation aspects that significantly simplify the tag's enrollment phase and minimize vulnerabilities to attacks. The paper also describes a prototype of this identification tag and provide detailed insights into its application.",

        "abstract": "The chaotic system as a source of randomness is very important for chaos-based secure communication. Different from other chaotic maps, this work explores an n-dimensional (nD) non-degeneracy discrete hyperchaotic map with any desired Lyapunov exponents (LEs). First, theoretical analysis proves that the proposed map is chaotic. Based on this proof, it is designed for any desired LEs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the nD new map, we use some chaotic and non-chaotic maps as examples. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed maps exhibit stronger chaotic properties and more complex dynamic behaviors compared to some previous results. Moreover, the chaotic signals generated by our maps passed NIST and TestU01 tests, which show our map has better randomness. Furthermore, a chaotic system with higher LEs do not necessarily have higher complexity degree. Next, the proposed map is implemented by hardware DSP platform, indicating the feasibility for industrial applications. More importantly, compared with other maps, the proposed map has simple structure with more complex behaviors and fewer parameters, and it is easy to set the desired LEs. Finally, we design a novel image encryption algorithm based on the proposed chaotic system and dynamic S-boxes. The experimental results show that the proposed chaotic system can be effectively applied in the field of data encryption.",

        "abstract": "The demand for efficient large integer polynomial multiplications in present day crypto-systems is the need of the hour. Toom-Cook multiplication algorithm being one of the most efficient multiplication algorithm is discussed in this work. The limitations of large integer polynomial multiplications using three-way Toom-Cook (Toom-3) multiplication algorithm and the methods to overcome it are presented in this paper. This is done by implementing two different division-free methods for symmetric Toom-3 multiplication as well as for asymmetric Toom-3 multiplication based on the input operand size (N). Hardware implementations of the proposed multiplication methods are done using Virtex-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device in Xilinx ISE platform. The trade-off between hardware utilization and speed is noted, and the overall performance of the proposed design methods are measured by calculating Area-Time-Product (ATP). Practically, it has been observed that both the proposed Toom-3 multiplication methods performs better compared to the existing state-of-the-art designs.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to the rapidly developing technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are able to complete a number of tasks in cooperation with each other without need for human intervention. In recent years, UAVs, which are widely utilized in military missions, have begun to be deployed in civilian applications and mostly for commercial purposes. With their growing numbers and range of applications, UAVs are becoming more and more popular; on the other hand, they are also the target of various threats which can exploit various vulnerabilities of UAV systems in order to cause destructive effects. It is therefore critical that security is ensured for UAVs and the networks that provide communication between UAVs. This survey seeks to provide a comprehensive perspective on security within the domain of UAVs and Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs). Our approach incorporates attack surface analysis and aligns it with the identification of potential threats. Additionally, we discuss countermeasures proposed in the existing literature in two categories: preventive and detection strategies. Our primary focus centers on the security challenges inherent to FANETs, acknowledging their susceptibility to insider threats due to their decentralized and dynamic nature. To provide a deeper understanding of these challenges, we simulate and analyze four distinct routing attacks on FANETs, using realistic parameters to evaluate their impact.Hence, this study transcends a standard review by integrating an attack analysis based on extensive simulations. Finally, we rigorously examine open issues, and propose research directions to guide future endeavors in this field.",

        "abstract": "In the landscape of Industry 4.0, enhancing data traceability across the supply chain is imperative. With the development of quantum computers, blockchains traditionally used for traceability struggle to guarantee the authenticity of data. Furthermore, only chained blocks have been used in previous traceability systems, which has resulted in a full backup for each business unit in the supply chain, wasting storage resources significantly. Another problem is that there are differences in the data structure and consensus mechanisms of each unit, which makes maintenance difficult. To address these problems, it is encouraging to create a new blockchain with high scalability and resistance to quantum attacks. This paper innovatively proposes a quantum hybrid blockchain-based data authenticity framework (QHB-DA) with five layers, which not only accomplishes traceability, but also has assurance that data can withstand verification. In QHB-DA, blockchain utilizes a combination of DAG and chained structures to reduce data redundancy, in which quantum hashes are performed to connect blocks. Algorithms ED-QKD and D2B-QSC are designed to keep the information from being leaked during transmission and format conversion. Through cost-benifit analysis, security analysis and empirical experiments, feasibility of quantum hashing and the attack resistance of the QHB-DA are demonstrated, which can reduce storage wastage and completely implement the data authenticity.",

        "abstract": "Smart grids feature a bidirectional flow of electricity and data, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, and reliability in increasingly volatile energy grids. However, data from smart meters can reveal sensitive private information. Consequently, the adoption of smart meters is often restricted via legal means and hampered by limited user acceptance. Since metering data is beneficial for fault-free grid operation, power management, and resource allocation, applying privacy-preserving techniques to smart metering data is an important research problem. This work addresses this by using secure multi-party computation (SMPC), allowing multiple parties to jointly evaluate functions of their private inputs without revealing the latter. Concretely, we show how to perform power flow analysis on cryptographically hidden prosumer data. More precisely, we present a tailored solution to the power flow problem building on an SMPC implementation of Newtons method. We analyze the security of our approach in the universal composability framework and provide benchmarks for various grid types, threat models, and solvers. Our results indicate that secure multi-party computation can be able to alleviate privacy issues in smart grids in certain applications.",

        "abstract": "Hiding countermeasures are the most widely utilized techniques for thwarting side-channel attacks. Commonly, the Fisher-Yates algorithm is adopted in hiding countermeasures with permuted operation for its security and efficiency in implementation, yet the inherently sequential nature of the algorithm imposes limitations on hardware acceleration. In this work, we propose a novel method named Addition Round Rotation (ARR), which can introduce a time-area trade-off with block-based permutation. Our findings indicate that this approach can achieve a permutation brute force complexity level ranging from 2 128, with the modified version achieving up to 2 288 in a single clock cycle, while maintaining substantial resistance against second-order analysis. To substantiate the security of our proposed method, we introduce a new validation technique â Identity Verification. This technique allows theoretical validation of the proposed algorithm's security and is consistent with the experimental results. Finally, we introduce an actual hardware design and provide the implementation results on Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). The measured performance demonstrates that our proposal fully supports the practical applicability.",

        "abstract": "We show that a class of optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can be efficiently PAC-learned to arbitrary precision with arbitrarily high probability, even in the presence of intentionally injected noise, given access to polynomially many challenge-response pairs, under mild and practical assumptions about the distributions of the noise and challenge vectors. We motivate our analysis by identifying similarities between the integrated version to Pappuâs original optical PUF design and the post-quantum, Learning with Errors (LWE), cryptosystems. We derive polynomial bounds for the required number of samples and the computational complexity of a linear regression algorithm, based on size parameters of the PUF, the distributions of the challenge and noise vectors, and the desired accuracy and probability of success of the regression algorithm. We use a similar analysis to that done by Bootle et al. [âLWE without modular reduction and improved side-channel attacks against BLISS,â in Advances in Cryptology â ASIACRYPT 2018], who demonstrated a learning attack on poorly implemented versions of LWE cryptosystems. This extends the results of RÃ¼hrmair et al. [âOptical PUFs reloaded,â Cryptology ePrint Archive, 2013], who presented a theoretical framework showing that a subset of this class of PUFs is learnable in polynomial time in the absence of injected noise, under the assumption that the optics of the PUF were either linear or had negligible nonlinear effects. RÃ¼hrmair et al. also included an experimental validation of this technique, which of course included measurement uncertainty, demonstrating robustness to the presence of natural noise.) We recommend that the design of strong PUFs should be treated as a cryptographic engineering problem in physics, as PUF designs would benefit greatly from basing their physics and security on standard cryptographic assumptions. Finally, we identify future research directions, including suggestions for how to modify an LWE-base...",

        "abstract": "Simon and Simeck are two famous lightweight block cipher families, both of which have good implementation performance benefiting from their extremely simple round functions. So, they are suitable and friendly in use for the Internet of Things devices that require high security but low-latency and low-energy. In this paper, we aim to improve the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming/Mixed-Integer Quadratic Constraint Programming (MILP/MIQCP) based method, to find better differential-linear (DL) distinguishers for the above ciphers, which can be exploited to mount distinguishing or key-recovery attacks. In particular, firstly, we give the completely precise MILP model to describe the linear part, and utilize the general expressions of Gurobi optimizer to model middle part in a quite easy way. Secondly, to explore DL trails in a reasonable time, we propose two heuristic strategies to speed up the searching process. Lastly, we introduce the transforming technique, which exploits the clustering effect on DL trails, to improve the estimated correlation of the DL approximation. By applying our enhanced method, we improve the DL distinguisher correlation from 2-59.75 to 2-59.62 for 32-round Simon128, and extend the number of longest rounds of valid DL distinguishers for Simon32/48/64/96 from 11/16/16/25 to 14/17/21/26. For Simeck, we do not outperform the currently best work, but refresh Zhou et al.âs results (the first work to automate finding DL distinguishers for Simon/Simeck using MILP/MIQCP). Our work not only provides a new insight on the automatic DL cryptanalysis, but also further confirms that Simon and Simeck are sufficiently strong to resist the DL attacks.",

        "abstract": "Mobile sequencing enables a rapid process of determining the order of nucleotides in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The process is carried out by portable sequencers, which are the main element in the internet of living things (IoLT). This approach assists in obtaining rapid biological insights at the source regardless of the patient's geographical location, for efficient care therapies as well as scientific discovery. Sequencing data and/or related analytical results produced in various formats will be sent from the sequencer to medical experts or healthcare professionals for performing the services. Communication in such IoLT environments encounters certain security concerns regarding information confidentiality and data integrity. Recently, Ren et al. proposed an anonymous user authentication scheme securing IoT communications, which is applicable to the IoLT. However, we found their work has some serious security issues, e.g., it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, stolen-device attacks, etc. This paper proposes an enhanced multi-factor device authentication (MFDA) protocol to address all weaknesses of Ren et al.' s work. In addition to the inherent device-to-cloud communication function, some other novel properties are supported in the MFDA, including group-oriented device-to-device communication, password and biometrics alteration, device revocation, and regrouping function. Security and performance evaluation shows that our protocol is robust against various attacks with a rational implementation cost. The proposed work paves a new way for future research ideas that further discover IoLT applications in the healthcare sector.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel two-dimensional logistic map (2D-LM). Relative to the classical 2D logistic modulation map (2D-LMM), it has larger chaotic range and better chaos performance. In comparison with some 2D chaos maps, the proposed new 2D-LM also has unique advantages in the complexity of sequence. To further study its application, the novel image encryption algorithm is designed based on the proposed 2D-LM. The security tests show the higher anti-decryption ability of the design algorithm. Finally, we develop a FPGA test platform to realize the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) based on the proposed 2D-LM. The experiment results show the feasibility of its industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "In order to protect the sensitive information in many applications involving neural networks, several privacy-preserving neural networks that operate on encrypted data have been developed. Unfortunately, existing encryption-based privacy-preserving neural networks are mainly built on classical cryptography primitives, which are not secure from the threat of quantum computing. In this paper, we propose the first quantum-resistant solution to protect neural network inferences based on an inner-product functional encryption scheme. The selected state-of-the-art functional encryption scheme based on lattice-based cryptography works with integer-type inputs, which is not directly compatible with neural network computations that operate in the floating point domain. We propose a polynomial-based secure convolution layer to allow a neural network to resolve this problem, along with a technique that reduces memory consumption. The proposed solution, named QuripfeNet, was applied in LeNet-5 and evaluated using the MNIST dataset. In a single-threaded implementation (CPU), QuripfeNet took 107.4 seconds for an inference to classify one image, achieving accuracy of 97.85%, which is very close to the unencrypted version. Additionally, the GPU-optimized QuripfeNet took 25.9 seconds to complete the same task, which is improved by 4.15 Ã compared to the CPU version.",

        "abstract": "Symmetric cryptography is the de-facto approach to information security for ad-hoc underwater acoustic networks. The requirement is that all network nodes possess the same cryptographic keys and key distribution that happens offline. Thus, it is hardly possible to include a new keyless node during network operation. In addition, online key replenishment is an open problem. In this article, we tackle key distribution/replenishment by formulating a new protocol that generates a key between two trusted underwater acoustic nodes (Alice and Bob) without the need to exchange the key itself. The proposed protocol initially extracts common acoustic channel features between Alice and Bob after some signal exchanges. Then, each party uses these features to generate his/her own secret bits via a random sequence generator. To correct any differences in their secret bits, we propose two reconciliation methods that employ ReedâSolomon codes. At the last step of the protocol, a 256-bit cryptographic key is generated by feeding the reconciled secret bit string to the Secure Hash Algorithm 3. We evaluate the key generation rate of the proposed protocol with real acoustic data recorded from a littoral environment, in which Alice and Bob exchanged 915 channel probes over different link geometries. To assess security performance, we invent a passive eavesdropper, Eve, who is able to simulate the acoustic link between Alice and Bob. She uses her simulated channels and the same protocol to generate her keys. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between the key generation rate of Alice and Bob and Eve's ability to extract the same key. Our best result shows that Alice and Bob can independently generate 567 keys out of 915 attempts while Eve does not have access to any of the keys.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision (CV) applications empower various Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. However, their advancements in image generation and manipulation tools make it increasingly easy to produce highly deceptive forged images, escalating the risk of image forgery. Cryptography-based methods can secure images but cannot support direct CV applications with compromised visual legibility. Existing generative adversarial network (GAN)-based steganography methods can effectively facilitate CV applications and image forgery prevention with high indistinguishability between stego and cover images. However, they are inefficient in resource-constrained IoT scenarios. Therefore, we propose a lightweight image forgery prevention scheme for IoT using GAN-based steganography. Our scheme embeds identity data within images. If forged, it fails to recover, triggering alerts. Our scheme can significantly improve efficiency with a lightweight generator designed by incorporating blueprint separable convolutions, sum connections and discrete wavelet transform while ensuring high effectiveness. Real-world IoT experimental results demonstrate this.",

Few homogeneous weight linear codes over finite chain rings have important applications in cryptography, lattices, modular forms and combinatorics. In this paper, we construct an infinite class of cyclic codes over the finite chain ring F pt [Ï]/(Ï 2 ) by the trace function, and determine their homogeneous weight distributions by applying the theory of exponential sums. In order to investigate the minimality of linear codes over finite chain rings, we firstly present the necessary and sufficient condition for linear codes over the finite chain ring F pt [Ï]/(Ï 2 ) to be minimal or almost minimal by the Hamming weights of codewords. Then, based on the proposed condition and few Hamming weight cyclic codes, we give several classes of minimal and almost minimal linear codes. Furthermore, we derive several families of strongly regular graphs, strongly walk-regular graphs and triple sum sets by few homogeneous weight linear codes.",

        "abstract": "Energy Internet is well-known nowadays for enabling bidirectional V2G communication; however, with communication and computation abilities, V2G systems become vulnerable to cyber-attacks and unauthorised access. An authentication protocol verifies the identity of an entity, establishes trust, and allows access to authorized resources while preventing unauthorized access. Research challenges for vehicle-to-grid authentication protocols include quantum security, privacy, resilience to attacks, and interoperability. The majority of authentication protocols in V2G systems are based on public-key cryptography and depend on some hard problems like integer factorization and discrete logs to guarantee security, which can be easily broken by a quantum adversary. Besides, ensuring both information security and entity privacy is equally crucial in V2G scenarios. Consequently, this work proposes a quantum-secured privacy-preserving key authentication and communication (QSKA) protocol using superdense coding and a hash function for unconditionally secure V2G communication and privacy. QSKA uses a password-based authentication mechanism, enabling V2G entities to securely transfer passwords using superdense coding. The QSKA security verification is performed in proof-assistant Coq. The security analysis and performance evaluation of the QSKA show its resiliency against well-known security attacks and reveal its enhanced reliability and efficiency with respect to state-of-the-art protocols in terms of computation, communication, and energy overhead.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to Vehicle (V2V) communications play crucial roles in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), enabling real-time data exchange and enhancing road safety. These communication methods necessitate robust authenticated key exchange (AKE) mechanisms to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access. Recent research has introduced lightweight V2I AKE schemes that operate without relying on complex asymmetric cryptography. These schemes offer advantages in terms of reduced computational overhead and minimal communication latency. However, their exclusive dependence on long-term secrets compromises forward secrecy, a critical security feature. In response, a novel multiparty V2I AKE protocol based on the ASCON cryptographic algorithm is proposed. Pre-shared keys between entities are dynamically updated at the end of each communication session, achieving forward secrecy while maintaining computational efficiency compared to existing solutions. Additionally, a cross-phase anddual-layerencryptionstrategyisemployedtoimplementconditionalprivacy.Buildinguponthisfoundation,afog-enabledand intra-group V2V AKE framework is proposed. Specifically, fog servers are introduced to manage vehicle grouping and distribute group keys. During the V2V AKE phase, fog servers encrypt and forward ephemeral secrets, ensuring resistance against the intra-group impersonation attack with minimal computational overhead. A comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed scheme demonstrates the superiority over existing solutions across various evaluation metrics.",

        "abstract": "The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system is a critical surveillance technology in Air Traffic Management (ATM), essential for enhancing aviation safety and operational efficiency. However, ADS-B broadcasts plaintext messages over open channels without authentication mechanisms, and is constrained by message length limitations and low bandwidth, making it susceptible to various attacks including deception, tampering, and replay. To address these challenges, we propose a secure and lightweight blockchain-integrated certificateless signature scheme (ECB-CLS) tailored for ADS-B systems with packet resilience. Specifically, we introduce an efficient signature verification algorithm based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that supports batch verification without the need for certificate management, complex bilinear pairing, or hash-to-point calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, our scheme leverages blockchain to ensure the decentralization and traceability of massive public keys and provides provable security against Type I and Type II adversary attacks. To address packet loss in practical environments, we incorporate both standard and enhanced Reed-Solomon (RS) coding to recover lost data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our blockchain-integrated ECB-CLS scheme offers substantial advantages in computational efficiency and signature length compared to existing methods, while also showing that RS coding introduces low performance overhead. This makes our solution highly suitable for resource-constrained ADS-B systems.",

        "abstract": "The development of emerging consumer technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing brings convenience but also raises critical concerns about securing communication data. Quantum computing threatens the security of classical public key cryptography, making post-quantum data protection essential. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks offer a solution, but the dependence on trusted relays raises security concerns. The existing QKD networks mainly consist of two types: measurement-device-dependent protocol based QKD networks which have a high dependence on trusted relays, and measurement-device-independent protocol based QKD networks which have a weak dependence on trusted relays but communication capability is limited. This paper proposes a Multi-Protocol Collaborative (MPC) networking cell combining both types of QKD protocol, which can reduce the dependence on trusted relays while maintaining a high communication capacity, and consequently has an enhanced practicality. An optimal topology method is also designed to further enhance the performance of the networks. Results show that communication capacity is improved 37 times compared to measurement-device-independent protocol based QKD networks. In addition, 23% reduction in the dependence on trusted relays compared to measurement-device-dependent protocol based QKD networks. By overcoming the trade-off between trust and capacity, this work significantly advances the practicalization of QKD networks in consumer electronics.",

        "abstract": "To ensure the privacy and security of charging services under Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) environment, it is critical to secure the charging stations (CSs) interaction with multiple electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we construct a heterogeneous broadcast signcryption protocol supporting equality test for IoVs (HBSC-ET), which addresses the communication problem between a CS and EVs featured with One-to-Many properties. In our design, the CS is allocated in public key infrastructure cryptosystem (PKI), while the EVs are equipped in identity-based cryptography (IBC). In order to address the restriction of EVs storage resources, the received ciphertexts at EV side, are alternatively uploaded to cloud server running equality test. Here, the cloud server legitimately executes the equality test, to determine whether two ciphertexts conclude the same message without unsigncryption. With this, the design HBSC-ET is advanced in terms of information utilization ratio. Finally, the rigorous experiment as well as performance analysis elaborate that our proposed scheme is more suitable for charging services in IoVs.",

        "abstract": "To combat the rapid spread of misinformation on social networks, automated misinformation detection systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have been developed. However, these tools are often proprietary and lack transparency, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, privacy concerns limit data sharing by data owners as well as by data-driven misinformation-detection services. Although data encryption techniques can help address privacy concerns in DNN inference, there is a challenge to the seamless integration of these techniques due to the encryption errors induced by cascaded encrypted operations, as well as a mismatch between the tools used for DNNs and cryptography. In this paper, we make two-fold contributions. Firstly, we study the noise bounds of homomorphic encryption (HE) operations as error propagation in DNN layers and derive two properties that, if satisfied by the layer, will considerably reduce the output error. We identify that $L_{2}$ regularization and sigmoid activation satisfy these properties and validate our hypothesis, for instance, replacing ReLU with sigmoid reduced the output error by $10^{6}\times$ (best case) to $10\times$ (worst case). Secondly, we extend the Python encryption library TenSeal by enabling the automatic conversion of a TensorFlow DNN into an encryption-compatible DNN with a few lines of code. These contributions are significant as encryption-friendly DL architectures are sorely needed to close the gap between DL-in-research and DL-in-practice.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) hold immense potential for complex tasks by harnessing quantum entanglement and superposition, such as physics simulation, artificial intelligence, and cryptography. However, the presence of quantum noise, stemming from hardware imperfections and environmental interactions, significantly reduces their practical performance. Moreover, the noise varies from different devices and shifts over time, necessitating continuous retraining models to chase and cater to the evolving noise, leading to high computation costs. In this paper, we present QuST, a novel QNN robust training framework designed to handle the noise in a once-and-for-all manner, which can tackle both spatial and temporal biases to maintain the QNN model accuracy under ever-changing noise conditions. Our approach consists of three key components. First, we propose a metric called Circuit Sequence Correctness (CSC) to characterize QNN circuit reliability in noisy environments. Then, we model CSC as a training weight to incorporate loss integration and utilize KL divergence to align noise inference with noise-free inference, thereby improving anti-noise capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce multi-scale noise-aware training to enhance the modelâs noise tolerance at various noise magnitudes. We conduct experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, along with 190-day historical noise simulations and one case study on 7 real IBMQ quantum computers. The results demonstrate 8.1% 15.1% and 9.1 11.45% accuracy improvements in temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to validate the effectiveness of the QuST!âs key components. The results demonstrate that QuST consistently sustains high accuracy without retraining, even under changing noise conditions, and exhibits minimal loss of accuracy as noise levels increase.",

        "abstract": "Networked systems are increasingly the target of cyberattacks that exploit vulnerabilities within digital communications, embedded hardware, and software. Arguably, the simplest class of attacks â and often the first type before launching destructive integrity attacks â are eavesdropping attacks, which aim to infer information by collecting system data and exploiting it for malicious purposes. A key technology of networked systems is state estimation, which leverages sensing and actuation data and first-principles models to enable trajectory planning, real-time monitoring, and control. However, state estimation can also be exploited by eavesdroppers to identify models and reconstruct states with the aim of, e.g., launching integrity (stealthy) attacks and inferring sensitive information. It is therefore crucial to protect disclosed system data to avoid an accurate state estimation by eavesdroppers. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature on privacy-preserving state estimation methods, while also identifying potential limitations and research gaps. Our primary focus revolves around three types of methods: cryptography, data perturbation, and transmission scheduling, with particular emphasis on Kalman-like filters. Within these categories, we delve into the concepts of homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, which have been extensively investigated in recent years in the context of privacy-preserving state estimation. Finally, we shed light on several technical and fundamental challenges surrounding current methods and propose potential directions for future research. Note to Practitioners âWith the increasing openness and anonymization of the networked estimation systems, privacy concerns require to be paid more attention. The essence of the privacy-preserving approaches is to seek certain tradeoffs among privacy budget and various performance metrics, such as utility and energy. Cryptographic methods are suitable for high-per...",

        "abstract": "The acceptability of blockchain technology has experienced significant growth due to its innovative nature, encompassing several key elements such as distributed data storage, peer-to-peer networking, integrity verification, consensus algorithms, cryptography, and smart contracts. The consensus algorithm plays a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of blockchain systems. The ongoing expansion of the digital economy presents a persistent challenge in identifying or constructing an optimal blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithm that effectively addresses specific business requirements especially for various applications of consumer electronics. This research study introduces a novel approach to enhance blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithms, prioritizing the augmentation of throughput, leaderâs capacity, and enhancement of fault tolerance. The solution under consideration employs committees established by the Louvain Modularity Optimisation (LMO) algorithm for local blockchain, along with reputation-based leader selection, to safeguard the integrity of the blockchain network globally. The proposed approach distributes the transactions among the committees and demonstrates an average throughput that is about 1.6 times greater than that of RapidChain following 100 iterations and 1.14 times more than that of the sharding technique. The results indicate that the utilization of reputation-based leader selection and immediate leader replacement, which is based on reputation score, effectively enhances the resilience of the system against attacks, while simultaneously boosting the overall throughput.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative machine learning while respecting data privacy. However, directly aggregating local models during FL training can expose sensitive information, as adversaries may analyze model parameters to infer the underlying raw data. Therefore, a robust authentication mechanism is required to verify the integrity of local models and confirm their source. However, many existing authentication schemes are computationally intensive, which can hinder performance. In this paper, we present a lightweight authentication scheme for FL called EPPAFL. This innovative approach is compatible with all machine learning algorithms, maintains data utility, and ensures strong privacy protection. Additionally, it can be integrated with detection mechanisms to defend against data poisoning and free-rider attacks. Specifically, we first design a certificate-less signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and then propose an anonymous authentication protocol based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), which supports batch verification, dynamic updates, and revocations of group keys. Moreover, participants interact anonymously for secure communication, and a trusted authority (TA) can trace and recover their identities in case of malicious activities. We provide formal security proofs and analyses to demonstrate the achieved security properties. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the costs associated with signature generation and verification, outperforming existing schemes in both communication and computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In the era of flourishing sustainable smart cities, with the accessibility of Internet and the persistent evolution of distributed computing, there is an increasing reliance on cloud/fog computing environments and online data storage platforms for secure data sharing. However, existing cryptographic schemes fall short in simultaneously satisfying security requirements such as bilateral fine-grained access control, resilience to quantum attacks, assurance of the authenticity of decrypted data, and forward security for historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose the innovative puncturable attribute-based matchmaking encryption scheme based on lattice cryptography. The method adeptly satisfies the aforementioned stringent security requirements concurrently, offering a triple-layered assurance for the secure implementation of secret sharing. The receiver, unable to successfully decrypt, remains uninformed about any specifics regarding ciphertexts and the access policy. Our PM-ABE scheme has manifested resilience against quantum attacks, collusion attacks, chosen plaintext attacks and ensuring unforgeability under chosen message attacks. Furthermore, our comprehensive efficiency analysis substantiates that our scheme maintains a favorable level of computational efficiency and storage consumption.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of consumer electronics technology has greatly promoted the progress of the metaverse. However, as a digitized virtual environment, the metaverse imposes high demands on the security of user identities and assets. In this context, asynchronous remote distributed key generation has become one of the key technologies to ensure the security of the metaverse. Unlike traditional key generation methods, the asynchronous nature makes the distributed key generation process more flexible, helping to address the dynamic and heterogeneous network environment within the metaverse. This paper proposes an asynchronous remote key generation method. This method employs public-key cryptography and basic asynchronous primitives to accomplish remote key generation and exchange through encryption and decryption operations between different nodes. In comparison to traditional methods, the asynchronous remote key generation approach provides higher security and reliability, while also showcasing increased efficiency and flexibility.",

        "abstract": "Payment channels serve as a promising solution to improving the scalability of permissionless blockchains, each of which allows two users to perform off-chain payments with almost unlimited frequency. Nevertheless, the payment channel risks encountering fund depletion, which threatens the availability of off-chain payments. The most recent method needs a cycle-based channel rebalancing procedure, which requires a fair leader and users with rebalancing demands forming directed cycles in the network. Therefore, its large-scale applications are restricted. Moreover, the privacy issue is not considered, leading to the leakage of rebalancing information. In this work, we introduce Shaduf++, a novel non-cycle off-chain rebalancing protocol that offers a new solution for users to shift coins among any channels to which they belong directly without relying on the cycle setting, and therefore could be applied to more general rebalancing scenarios. Furthermore, utilizing the cryptography primitives, including the commitment and the range proof schemes, Shaduf++ preserves the privacy for the rebalancing operations. We provide the details of Shaduf++ and formally prove its security under the Universal Composability framework. Our prototype demonstrates its feasibility and the experimental evaluation shows that Shaduf++ enhances the Lighting Network performance in payment success ratio and volume.",

        "abstract": "Robustness, discrimination and security are essential characteristics of perceptual image hashing in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose two image hashing schemes based on block discrete wavelet transform (BDWT) to achieve these three characteristics. The basic scheme combines block discrete wavelet transform, singular value decomposition and statistics feature to extract the features of each overlapping image block. And chaotic cryptography is applied to encrypt these features. Furthermore, image correction is added to the basic scheme to realize a more comprehensive image hashing IC-BDWT, which can resist rotation attack. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments on 400 images from four public databases to analyze the proposed schemes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the experimental results demonstrates that the proposed hashing algorithms exhibit superior robustness and discrimination compared to the latest hashing algorithms under common content-preserving attacks. And the IC-BDWT hashing is far better than other algorithms in resisting rotation attack. Experimental results show that our schemes are secure and sensitive to secret keys.",

        "abstract": "Integer polynomial multiplication has been frequently used in post-quantum cryptography and fully homomorphic encryption systems. Particularly, there exists a special polynomial multiplication, where the polynomial degree can be a power of two and the coefficients of the two input polynomials are unequal-sized (difficult to deploy fast algorithm for implementation efficiency). Following this direction, in this paper, we propose a novel hardware-implemented Lightweight and Timing-Efficient (LTE) integer polynomial multiplication design framework. We proposed two new algorithms for efficient implementation of the targeted polynomial multiplication. Accordingly, we presented two hardware accelerators with the help of several new hardware design techniques. The final implementation showcases the proposed acceleratorsâ superior performance, e.g., the proposed Accelerator-I (v=512) has 44.7% less equivalent area-delay product (EADP) than the state-of-the-art design for n=4,096, while the proposed Accelerator-II has at least 38.7% less ADP than the competing designs for n=1,024. The proposed strategy is highly efficient and can be extended for other usage.",

        "abstract": "With the development of Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), data security emerges as a significant challenge, especially regarding data tampering and the spread of false information. While cryptography technologies tackle external security threats, they fall short in addressing internal security threats, such as authorized malicious vehicles tampering with and spreading false information. Consequently, trust management becomes a crucial technology, focusing on the analysis and identification of internal inappropriate behaviors to ensure safe interactions among vehicles. This paper explores the effective integration of trust opinions provided by Roadside Units (RSUs) into trust evaluations in IoVs, ensuring the comprehensiveness and accuracy of trust evaluations. We propose a Dual-model Consensus-based Anti-risk Confidence Allocation trust management scheme (DCACA) in IoVs. Specifically, DCACA utilizes direct trust, indirect trust, and global trust, to evaluation the trustworthiness of vehicles. Furthermore, to address the potential untrustworthiness of network entities (RSUs and vehicles), DCACA employs a dual-model consensus mechanism operates two processes of reaching consensus, including Real-time Collection Consensus Mechanism (RCCM) and Matrix-based Consensus Mechanism (MCM). RCCM is based on real-time collected trust opinions, reaching consensus to identify potential malicious trust opinions. MCM utilizes trust opinion matrices to collect trust opinions and achieves consensus through the elements in these matrices, identifying the sources of malicious trust opinions. Additionally, DCACA utilizes an anti-risk confidence allocation mechanism assigns confidence levels based on risk assessments, to mitigate the impact of malicious entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms other baseline schemes, exhibiting high levels of precision, recall, and F-Measure.",
